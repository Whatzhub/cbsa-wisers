Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

I am pleased to announce that  
2020 was an outstanding year for 
TTI with exceptional revenue and 
profit growth.

We reported sales of US$9.8 billion, an increase of 28.0%.  
Our second half sales grew an exceptional 42.3%, outpacing  
the market. Increased strategic investment in new product, 
manufacturing capacity, geographic expansion, and our in-field 
marketing initiatives is the driving force behind our industry  
leading extraordinary growth.

TTI continued to strengthen its global leadership position with robust 
sales growth in every business unit and in all geographic regions. 
North America delivered growth of 29.5%, EMEA grew 19.1% and 
ROW grew 30.6%. Our Power Equipment business, representing 
89.0% of total sales, grew 28.5% to US$8.7 billion. Our MILWAUKEE 
Professional, the RYOBI DIY, and the RYOBI Outdoor businesses all 
delivered double-digit growth. Our Floorcare business produced sales 
growth of 23.6% to US$1.1 billion.

Gross margin improved for the 12th consecutive year, from 37.7%  
in 2019 to 38.3% in 2020. This gross margin improvement is a direct 
result of the launching of high margin new product, disciplined mix 
management, exceptional productivity gains and volume leverage. 
Additionally, our relentless focus on operational excellence improved 
productivity throughout our operations.

A major strategic initiative for TTI is our commitment to building out  
a world class e-commerce capability. We achieved fantastic traction 
with e-commerce and Buy Online Pickup In Store (BOPIS). We have 
worked closely with our customers, capitalizing on the accelerated 
shift to online and BOPIS. An example of our world class leadership 
in e-commerce is The Home Depot presenting us with their 
Omnichannel Interconnected Partner of the Year award in 2020.

Our Response to COVID
When it became clear that the coronavirus was a global issue, our 
immediate priority was to focus on the safety of our employees, their 
families, our customers and end users. We are incredibly proud of 
the way our global team managed throughout this pandemic, staying 
safe while supporting our customers.

Starting in April 2020, we made a bold decision to further accelerate 
investment in additional sales/field marketing specialists, engineers, 
new product development resources and geographic expansion to 
seize market share and drive above market growth. We also made  
the bold decision to aggressively expand manufacturing capacity  
in China, Vietnam, Mexico, and North America and we invested in 
higher levels of inventory to better serve our customers. 

Financial Performance
EBIT increased 29.0% to US$868 million, with the EBIT margin 
improving by 10 basis points to 8.9%. Net Profit rose 30.2% to 
US$801 million, with earnings per share increasing 30.1% over  
2019 to US43.80 cents. We invested in inventory to support our 
above market growth levels, while working capital management 
remained best-in-class at 14.0% of sales.

Outlook
We are well positioned to continue outperforming the market, with  
a strong balance sheet and a disciplined fixed and working capital 
management process. We are positioned to capitalize on the many 
growth opportunities we have identified in the months and years ahead.

I would like to thank our customers, end users, suppliers, shareholders, 
Board and entire TTI organization for another outstanding year.  
Our dedicated, skilled and passionate teams across the globe are 
enabling us to achieve outstanding results. It is our unrelenting bold 
vision, customer focus and business momentum that will make 2021 
another successful year and position TTI with exciting opportunities 
in the decade to come.

“To achieve growth and global expansion 
like ours is a testament to the quality of 
our team, strength of our culture and the 
crystal-clear focus of our strategy.”

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

2020 was clearly a breakout year 
for TTI. In just twelve months,  
we grew sales organically by  
US$2.1 billion, while improving 
gross margin and net profit. This 
extraordinary performance was 
driven by our unwavering strategic 
focus on cordless technology.

We are leading the revolution from traditional power sources to 
cordless in power tools, light equipment, outdoor products and 
cleaning. Our technologically advanced cordless products drive  
our sales and gross margin improvement, which funds additional 
strategic SG&A investments in R&D, new product development and 
in-field marketing specialists, creating a virtuous cycle of growth.  
It is through our bold strategic direction, operational excellence, and 
exceptional team that TTI has consistently delivered on our financial 
goals of outgrowing the market, driving gross margin improvement, 
and growing profit faster than sales.

Cordless Leadership
We are obsessively focused on developing advanced, demonstrably 
better, technologically superior cordless products. In 2020, our 
MILWAUKEE brand became the fastest growing and #1 Professional 
Tool Brand in the world, while RYOBI extended its leadership position 
as the largest global DIY Tool Brand. Our drive for advancing cordless 
technology continues to intensify. When one version of a product 
launches in the market, we immediately focus on the engineering of 
the next generation with improved run-time, power, speed, life, 
compactness and other breakthrough features. Examples of these 
advancements include our recently launched next generation RYOBI 
High Performance (HP) Brushless series, our next generation 
MILWAUKEE M18 FUEL SAWZALL, the revolutionary MILWAUKEE 
MX FUEL Light Equipment System, and our leadership range of 
RYOBI cordless mowers. 

In addition to our relentless focus on advancing cordless technology, 
we also continue to deploy our geographic expansion strategy.  
When we enter a new strategic market, we enter aggressively  
with a strong team to rapidly develop the market. Our geographic 
expansion efforts are an ongoing success at TTI.

Hiring the Best
We viewed 2020 as an opportunity to bolster our talent pool and 
recruit the very best off of college campuses across the globe.  
Our top focus was hiring newly minted engineers. We’ve built out  
a vastly superior global engineering capability with R&D Centers 
located around the US, Europe, Australia, Vietnam and China.  
In 2020, we augmented our engineering powerhouse with over  
six hundred newly recruited engineers who drive technological 
advancements and accelerate the pace of our new product launches. 
These high potential electrical engineers, software development 
engineers and other technical engineering specialists have joined  
TTI from over 100 college campuses around the world. 

In addition, while other companies pulled back on recruiting in  
2020, we accelerated and hired 1,208 high-potential college 
graduates into our Leadership Development Program (LDP).  
Since its beginning thirteen years ago, the program has supported  
our growth by creating a pipeline of future leaders across the sales, 
marketing, engineering, purchasing, supply-chain, manufacturing, 
and finance disciplines. Today, some of these LDP graduates hold 
roles with increasing levels of responsibility up to vice presidents  
and presidents. We are committed to developing even more LDPs 
into meaningful leadership roles throughout the organization in  
2021 and beyond.

Winning Culture
Our vision is to be number one in the industries we serve, and this 
drives a high-performance culture across all levels and functions of 
our organization. Our unique high-speed decision-making process 
supports our maniacal focus on developing superior cordless 
products and meeting high customer service level expectations.  
We view our winning culture as a competitive advantage that  
powers our growth.

Chief Executive Officer’s Message 
This year, our team performed admirably through the challenges 
presented by the coronavirus pandemic while keeping the safety of 
our employees, their families, our customers and end users as the 
priority. I am incredibly proud of the way our team has adhered to  
all safety protocols, while engaging with customers and end users  
all over the globe. 

Strategic Capacity Investments
In 2020, we made the bold decision to build out additional 
manufacturing capacity in support of our future growth. We invested 
in our world-class facility in China, while expanding operations in 
Vietnam, Mexico, Europe, and across the United States. Construction 
is currently underway on new greenfield manufacturing sites in 
Wisconsin and South Carolina that will further increase the agility  
of our operations network. 

Our expanding global manufacturing footprint gives us the ability to 
produce high quality products with the flexibility to quickly react to 
changing geopolitical and environmental factors. All sites across the 
globe adhere to the TTI OPEX philosophy of driving productivity, 
delivering world class quality, and maintaining best-in-class service 
levels for our customers.

Sustainability
Our mission is to lead our industry in replacing high-polluting, 
fossil-fueled products with our environmentally friendly, clean 
cordless powered technology. We are reshaping sustainability into  
a core competency by embracing best Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) practices. Our global organization understands 
that economic, social and environmental aims are all interrelated  
and firmly believes that our ability to grow and innovate is linked  
to our ESG performance.

A Bold Vision for the Future
In 2020, we dramatically outpaced the market. To achieve growth 
and global expansion like ours is a testament to the quality of  
our team, strength of our culture and the crystal-clear focus of  
our strategy. Our bold investments in new product development, 
manufacturing, geographic expansion and in-field marketing 
initiatives drove our growth and our position as industry leaders.  
We continued to strengthen our global leadership position with 
tremendous sales growth in every business unit and all geographic 
regions. Once again, we are thrilled with our 2020 performance, 
however we believe the next five years will be an amazing period  
for the company’s sales and profit growth.

I feel incredibly fortunate for the partnership and alignment  
I share with our Chairman, Horst Pudwill, and Vice Chairman, 
Stephan Pudwill. It is a powerful competitive advantage to share  
the leadership responsibilities with these bold leaders, and we  
are all relentlessly focused on winning in cordless. I’d like to  
thank them both for their tremendous teamwork in 2020 and  
look forward to many more years of partnership ahead. Together,  
we share a vision for an incredible future, and we are confident  
the best is yet to come.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
Financial Position
The Group continued to maintain a strong financial position.  
As at December 31, 2020, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents 
amounted to US$1,534 million (2019: US$1,412 million), of  
which 54.9%, 21.9%, 7.8%, and 15.4% were denominated in  
US$, EUR, AUD and other currencies respectively.

Trade payable days were 117 days as compared to 104 days in 2019 
as the Group managed to leverage the volume and order visibility for 
better trade terms from suppliers.

Working capital as a percentage of sales was at 14.0% as compared 
to 14.3% in 2019.

The Group’s net gearing, expressed as a percentage of total net 
borrowing (excluding bank advance from factored trade receivables 
which are without recourse in nature) to equity attributable to Owners 
of the Company, was at net cash in 2020.

Capital Expenditure
Total capital expenditures for the year amounted to US$459 million 
(2019: US$457 million).

Bank Borrowings
Long term borrowings accounted for 71.4% of total debts (2019: 52.9%).

The Group’s major borrowings continued to be in US Dollars. Borrowings 
are predominantly LIBOR based. There is a natural hedge mechanism 
in place as the Group’s major revenues are in US Dollars and currency 
exposure therefore is low. Currency, interest rate exposures, and cash 
management functions are all being closely monitored and managed 
by the Group’s treasury team.

Capital Commitments and Guarantees
As at December 31, 2020, total capital commitments for the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment contracted for but not provided 
amounted to US$104 million (2019: US$58 million), and there were 
no material guarantees or off balance sheet obligations.

Charge
None of the Group’s assets are charged or subject to encumbrance.

Amongst the bank borrowings, fixed rate debts account for 35.6%  
of the total bank borrowings, the balance being floating rate debts.

Major Customers and Suppliers
For the year ended December 31, 2020

Working Capital 
Total inventory was at US$3,224 million as compared to US$2,113 million 
in 2019. Days inventory increased by 19 days from 101 days to 120 
days. The higher inventory days as compared to past years was mainly

the Independent Non-executive Directors has been received by  
the Company and they are still considered to be independent.

The Board has arranged appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance to indemnify the Directors and Officers of the Group for 
liabilities arising out of corporate activities. The coverage and the sum 
insured under the policy are reviewed annually.

Board Meetings
An effective Board is essential to lead the Company to success and 
sustainability. The Company held regular Board meetings, where at 
least four Board meetings are scheduled in a year with more frequent 
meetings as and when required. In 2020, five Board meetings were 
held and the attendance records of each Director are set out in the 
section headed “Board, Board Committee and General Meetings in 
2020” at the end of this report.

In order to ensure maximum attendance of Directors and to facilitate 
the effectiveness of the Board, Board meeting, Board Committee 
meeting and Annual General Meeting dates for 2021 were agreed 
upon at the Board meeting held in August 2020. The meeting agenda 
is set by the Chairman in consultation with members of the Board to 
include any other matters raised by Directors in advance. Minutes 
of the Board and Board Committee meetings with sufficient details 
of matters and concerns discussed are prepared and maintained by 
the Company Secretary of the Company (the “Company Secretary”), 
which are sent to the Directors for comment and records. Board 
records which are kept in safe custody by the Company Secretary are 
available for inspection by the Directors.

61

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportTo facilitate informed decisions of the Board, all Directors are 
provided with accurate, reliable and complete information on the 
affairs of the Group in a timely manner. Furthermore, all Directors 
have access to all related materials with sufficient details in relation to 
the Board’s issues. To enhance understanding of the business of  
the Group and Directors’ responsibilities under statute and at common  
law, all Directors are provided with briefings and professional 
development training as necessary. The Company Secretary provide 
full support to the Directors in order to ensure Board procedures and 
all applicable laws, rules and regulations are followed. Directors are 
also provided with access to senior management of the Group upon 
request, as well as to independent professional advice on performing 
their duties at the Company’s expense.

Board Committees
The Board has established three Board Committees, namely the 
Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee, to delegate various responsibilities. Each of these Board 
Committees has specific written terms of reference which deal clearly 
with their authority and duties and have been published on the 
Company’s website (www.ttigroup.com) and the Stock Exchange’s 
website (www.hkexnews.hk).

Independent Non-executive Directors form majority of all Board 
Committees. With active participation and regular attendance of 
Independent Non-executive Directors, independent views and 
opinions are encouraged to be contributed and expressed at the 
Board Committee meetings. The Board oversees and monitors the 
delegated authority and responsibilities through regular reporting 
by the Board Committees in relation to their activities involved and 
recommendations and decisions made. The attendance records of 
each Board Committee are set out in the section headed “Board, 
Board Committee and General Meetings in 2020” at the end of this 
report.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Peter David Sullivan with other 
members being Mr Vincent Ting Kau Cheung, Mr Johannes-Gerhard 
Hesse, Mr Camille Jojo and Mr Robert Hinman Getz (who has been 
appointed with effect from August 12, 2020). All members except 
Mr Camille Jojo are Independent Non-executive Directors. Majority of 
the members of the Audit Committee have professional qualifications 
or accounting or related financial management expertise as required 
under Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules.

The Audit Committee aims to review and monitor the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal control systems to ensure the 
compliance with the Group’s obligations under the Listing Rules and 
other applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee oversees 
the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and take ad 
hoc responsibilities which may be delegated by the Board from time 
to time. The Audit Committee is also directly responsible on behalf of 
the Board for the selection, oversight and remuneration of  
the Company’s external auditors, the assessment of the independence 
and qualifications of the external auditors, the oversight of the 
performance of the Company’s external auditors and the maintenance 
of an appropriate relationship with the external auditors.

62

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportNomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Horst Julius Pudwill 
(Chairman of the Board) with the other members being Mr Vincent 
Ting Kau Cheung, Mr Christopher Patrick Langley OBE and  
Mr Johannes-Gerhard Hesse. All members except Mr Horst Julius 
Pudwill are Independent Non-executive Directors.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is composed of a majority of 
Independent Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Mr Vincent 
Ting Kau Cheung with the other members of the Committee being  
Mr Christopher Patrick Langley OBE, Mr Peter David Sullivan and  
Mr Camille Jojo.

To effectively discharge its function, the Board should have a balance 
of skills and experience appropriate for the requirements of the 
business of the Group. The Nomination Committee aims to ensure a 
fair and transparent process of Board appointments, and in particular, 
to assist the Board to identify suitably qualified candidates and make 
recommendations for consideration of the Board and shareholders. 
When considering suitable candidates of Directors, the Nomination 
Committee considers factors including, but not limited to, ethics, 
integrity, professional knowledge, industry experience, personal skills 
and as well as the ability to contribute sufficient time and attention to 
the Board in their recommendations.

The Nomination Committee held two meetings in 2020. The work 
performed by the Nomination Committee in 2020, with sufficient 
resources provided by the Company and/or independent professional 
advice when necessary, included:

• 

• 

review the Nomination Policy and the Board Diversity Policy.

review of the composition, size and structure of the Board on a 
regular basis.

•  make recommendations to the Board on relevant matters 

relating to the retirement and re-election of the Directors at the 
2020 Annual General Meeting.

• 

assess the independence of Independent Non-executive 
Directors.

The Board has adopted the Board Diversity Policy in August 2013, 
which is published on the Company’s website (www.ttigroup.com). 
Widening diversity at the Board level is essential for sustainable 
development of the Group. The Nomination Committee would 
consider various perspectives, including, but not limited to, age, 
gender, educational background, cultural, professional experience 
and length of service while reviewing the composition of the Board. 
An analysis of the current Board composition based on these 
objective criteria is set out on page 59 of this report.

The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include, but 
not limited to, developing and administering a fair and transparent 
procedure for setting policy on the overall human resources 
strategy of the Group and the remuneration of Directors and senior 
management of the Group, and determining their remuneration 
packages, on the basis of their merit, competence and qualifications, 
and having regard to individual performance, the Company’s 
operating results and return to shareholders, and comparable market 
statistics. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board on the remuneration packages of Executive Directors 
and senior management, including, without limitation, base 
salaries, benefits in kind, compensation payments and bonuses, 
and consults the Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer for the 
proposals of other Executive Directors’ remuneration packages. The 
Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board 
on the remuneration of Non-executive Directors and Independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee reports 
directly to the Board on its decisions or recommendations and with 
access to sufficient resources and professional advice if necessary.

The Remuneration Committee held three meetings in 2020 and 
performed, among other work, the following:

• 

• 

review and make recommendations on the existing 
Remuneration Policy for Directors and senior management.

assess the Executive Directors’ performance and remuneration 
packages.

The Group engages a global executive compensation consulting 
firm as an independent third party to assess the competitiveness 
of compensation of the Chairman, the CEO and other Executive 
Directors. The compensation packages of the Group’s Executive 
Directors were assessed relative to similar positions at 20 similarly 
sized peer companies operating in the same or adjacent industries. 
The consultant’s assessment took into account the Group’s absolute 
share price, financial and operational performance, as well as that 
relative to the peer companies.

63

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportGroup CEO Incentive Compensation
The Remuneration Committee reviewed and recommended to  
the Board for approval the 2020 incentive payouts for the Chairman, 
the CEO and other Executive Directors commensurate with the 
exceptional performance delivered by the Group.

Executive compensation, and especially the Group CEO’s 
compensation, is dependent on company performance as measured 

by a number of operational and financial metrics. In particular, the 
Remuneration Committee believes it is extremely important to align 
executive compensation with the interests of shareholders. As shown 
in Chart 1 below, over the past five years the Group has exceeded 
the 75th percentile performance of 20 peer companies in a number 
of key performance metrics such as revenue growth, EBIT growth, 
diluted EPS growth, gross profit margin improvement and stock price 
performance.

Long-term Incentive Plan
In 2018 the Board approved multi-year performance-based share 
awards to Mr Galli (“2018 CEO Share Awards”) with the granting of 
the awards conditional upon the Company’s achievement of share 
price, financial, and operational performance criteria (“Performance 
Criteria”) over successive three-year performance periods ending 
each year from 2019 to 2023. Performance is assessed on both an 
absolute and relative basis. Mr Galli delivered exceptional share price, 
financial and operational performance over the three-year period 
ending in 2020 and he was therefore awarded one million shares, as 
per the terms of the incentive plan agreement (“2020 Award”). These 
shares are scheduled to vest to Mr Galli on January 1, 2025 if he 
remains in his current role.

Over the last three years, the Group delivered 17.4% compound 
annual revenue growth and 18.7% compound annual EBIT growth. 
The Group’s revenue and EBIT growth over this period have 
approximated the 90th percentile of performance of the Primary Peer 
Group. Additionally, the Company’s operating profit margin exceeds 
two-thirds of our peer group and has been improving at a significantly 
faster rate than most peers over the past three years.

Annual Incentive Plan Awards
As part of the Group’s annual incentive plan, the Remuneration 
Committee in 2020 approved share awards to Mr Galli in connection 
with the Group’s 2020 fiscal year performance (“2020 STI Share 
Grants”). These share awards were made in lieu of cash payouts 
under the Company’s annual incentive plan. Specifically, the 
Remuneration Committee granted Mr Galli 2,000,000 shares in  
total upon the achievement of specified 2020 fiscal year  
performance goals. The first grant of 1,000,000 shares was made 
on December 21, 2020 in recognition of the Group’s exceptional 
performance in the 1st half of 2020. These shares were vested upon 
grant. The second grant of 1,000,000 shares will be granted in March 
2021 following certification of the achievement of Group performance 
in the 2nd half of 2020. As these grants are made as part of the 
annual incentive plan, these shares will be vested upon grant.

Besides the above-mentioned Annual Incentive Plan Awards,  
the Board approved another multi-year performance-based share 
awards to Mr Galli (“2020 CEO Share Awards”) with the granting of 
the awards conditional upon the Company’s achievement of financial 
and operational performance criteria (“Financial and Performance 
Criteria”) for the year of 2021 and the years between 2022 to 2026. 
Under the 2020 CEO Share Awards, 1,000,000 shares will be granted 
every year if the Financial and Performance Criteria have been 
achieved for that year.

64

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportThe remainder of the 2018 CEO Share Awards (up to three million 
shares) will be awarded subject to the Company’s future performance 
meeting the goals set out in the 2018 CEO Share Awards plan from 
2021 to 2023. The 2020 Award were made under the 2018 Share 
Award Scheme, described below.

Mr Galli’s Performance History
The compensation package awarded to Mr Galli, including the 2020 
Award and the 2020 STI Share Grants, were awarded on the basis of 
the Group’s exceptional performance in 2020 despite difficult global 
economic conditions and the uncertain global health environment.

Mr Galli’s compensation recognizes the Company’s stellar growth and 
performance over the period of his tenure as CEO of the Group from 
February 2008 through 2020 and further serves to ensure that he will 
continue to serve in his current role. As shown in Chart 2, since  
Mr Galli assumed the CEO role, TTI’s stock price has increased from 
HK$8.40 on February 1, 2008 to close at HK$110.60 at December 
31, 2020, an increase of more than 1,200%, far outpacing both 
the Hang Seng Index and the S&P500 Index over that time. Since 
February 2008, the Group’s equity market capitalization has grown 
from approximately HK$12.6 billion to over HK$200 billion at the end 
of December 2020.

Chart 2: TTI Stock Price Performance Relative to Hang Seng Index 
and S&P500 Index, from February 2008 until December 31, 2020

The Company has adopted two share award schemes, namely  
the 2008 Share Award Scheme and the 2018 Share Award Scheme. 
The 2008 Share Award Scheme was adopted on January 9, 2008  
(the “2008 Adoption Date”) and expired from January 9, 2018, 
though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other 
respects. Following the expiry of the 2008 Share Award Scheme, the 
2018 Share Award Scheme was adopted with effect from January 17, 
2018 (the “2018 Adoption Date”).

The scheme rules of both the 2008 Share Award Scheme and the 
2018 Share Award Scheme are substantially identical and below are 
the summary of the principal terms of both schemes:

Any employee or Director (including, without limitation, any 
Executive, Non-executive or Independent Non-executive Director) of 
any member of the Group (the “Eligible Person”) will be entitled to 
participate the schemes. Unless terminated earlier by the Board in 
accordance with the respective scheme rules, the effective term of 
each scheme is 10 years commencing on the adoption date of the 
relevant scheme provided that no contribution to the trust will be 
made by the Company on or after the 10th anniversary date of the 
adoption date of the relevant scheme. Details of both schemes were 
announced by the Company on the respective adoption date of the 
schemes.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportThe Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select 
any Eligible Person for participation in any scheme as a selected 
grantee (the “Selected Grantee”) and determine the number of 
shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The 
relevant number of shares awarded will be purchased by the trustee 
of the schemes from the market or new shares will be subscribed for 
by the trustee at the cost of the Company and be held in trust until 
they are vested. When the Selected Grantee has satisfied all vesting 
conditions specified by the Board, the trustee will transfer the relevant 
vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of 
accrued interest) to the Selected Grantee.

The maximum number of shares which can be awarded under each 
scheme is 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the 
adoption date thereof, and the maximum number of shares which 
can be awarded under each scheme to a Selected Grantee, at any 
one time, shall not in aggregate exceed 1% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at the adoption date thereof. The total issued 
share capital of the Company as at the 2008 Adoption Date and  
the 2018 Adoption Date were 1,501,252,152 shares and 
1,835,021,941 shares, respectively.

Since the 2008 Adoption Date and up to December 31, 2020, a  
total of 3,946,000 shares had been awarded under the 2008 Share 
Award Scheme, representing 0.26% of the issued share capital of  

the Company as at the 2008 Adoption Date. No recognition of  
share-based payment expenses under the 2008 Share Award Scheme 
during the year was incurred. During the year ended December 31, 
2020, no share was transferred to the Selected Grantees upon vesting 
under the 2008 Share Award Scheme and no total payout, including 
related expenses was incurred.

Since the 2018 Adoption Date and up to December 31, 2020, a  
total of 6,117,000 shares had been awarded under the 2018 Share  
Award Scheme, representing 0.33% of the issued share capital of  
the Company as at the 2018 Adoption Date. Recognition of  
share-based payment expenses under the 2018 Share Award 
Scheme during the year was US$14,569,000. During the year ended  
December 31, 2020, a total of 3,393,000 shares had been awarded 
under the 2018 Share Award Scheme to twelve Directors of the Company,  
representing 0.18% of the issued share capital of the Company  
as at the 2018 Adoption Date. The total payout, including related  
expenses, amounted to US$19,438,000. In addition, during the year  
ended December 31, 2020, 2,364,000 shares were transferred to  
six Directors and certain Selected Grantees upon vesting under  
the 2018 Share Award Scheme. As at December 31, 2020, details of

required to be disclosed pursuant to statutory requirements.

To achieve long term goals of the Group, effective risk management 
and internal control systems are essential. The Board continuously

systems, and to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that 
material misstatement or loss can be avoided. A whistle blowing 
policy (the “Whistle Blowing Policy”) has been adopted in order to

Vice Chairman’s Message

“ Culture is driven from the top, and every 
member of our company’s leadership 
team and our Board of Directors drives  
TTI to align its core strategic drivers  
and culture with ESG values.”

74

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report2020 challenged the world and its 
global citizenry perhaps as never 
before. We are proud that throughout 
this challenging year, we assiduously 
maintained our dedication to our 
people and to their health and safety.

We are equally proud that we strengthened our commitment to be  
a global leader in environmental sustainability, social responsibility, 
and ethical corporate governance. While achieving an unprecedented 
level of growth and success, we intensified our focus on recruiting 
and retaining a talented and diverse global workforce.

Culture is driven from the top, and every member of our company’s 
leadership team and our Board of Directors drives TTI to align its  
core strategic drivers and culture with ESG values. By promoting 
these commitments and beliefs throughout the organization, we  
have successfully driven initiatives that deliver positive impacts for 
our employees, customers, suppliers, investors, other partners, and 
society. The following are examples of just some of those initiatives:

•  Environment: Even in the face of a global pandemic, we continued 
to relentlessly invest in talent and R&D to produce revolutionary, 
environmentally responsible cordless products that will accelerate 
the world’s conversion away from gas-powered products and other 
legacy technologies. Our industry-leading products are designed 
and engineered to reduce emissions, noise, vibration, size, and weight 
and otherwise improve ergonomics for users. These innovative 
products include our WHISPER series of leaf blowers which 
substantially reduce the noise produced in residential and commercial 
neighborhoods, highly efficient brushless motors, and an expanded 
platform of cordless cleaning, tool and outdoor products. We take 
immense pride in receiving The Home Depot’s Environmental 
Partner of the year award and will continue to build on our successes. 
As a whole, we worked to reduce TTI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions intensity and as we continue to grow, we are setting 
environmental targets and incorporating environmental requirements 
into the design of our new and existing facilities.

•  Social and Community: The health and safety of our employees are 
our top priority, and our global facilities adhered to government 
and health agency guidelines and best practices and provided 
employee training, personal protective equipment, and other 
support wherever and whenever needed. The recruitment into our 
Leadership Development Program (LDP) was unmatched in the 
record number of exceptional people hired who represent the 
future leadership of TTI. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives help 
enable us to attract and retain a global workforce who represent 
diversity in many dimensions.

•  Governance: We have expanded our ESG Executive Committee, 
comprised of Board members and members of our leadership 
team across geographic regions and functional areas. Additionally, 
we renewed our membership to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
which aims to increase transparency in ESG reporting. We joined 
the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) as a supporter member  
to foster human rights, environment protection and overcome 
potential ethical supply chain challenges.

At TTI, we are and will remain unflaggingly passionate about pursuing 
our strategic drivers while fulfilling our commitment to a more just, 
diverse, safe, and environmentally responsible world. I am confident 
that our exceptional people will continue to meet the challenges and 
exceed the goals that lay ahead as we continue to lead our industry 
toward a more sustainable future.

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | Vice Chairman’s MessageTTI’s ESG Approach and Strategic Framework

Instilling ESG best practices along our value chain drives TTI’s 
approach to sustainability in the way we operate, what we produce, 
how we source and the way we live. Sustainability is at the core of  
our business today and is the bedrock for both the development  
of our business and creating shared value for all our stakeholders’ 
future prosperity. Our strategic framework for ESG is based on 
engagement with our stakeholders to learn what is important to them, 
their needs and key concerns. Their feedback helps TTI conduct a 
comprehensive assessment process which allows us to identify our 
material topics that impact the sustainability of our value chain and 
business overall.

We understand that our actions are not only of significant importance to 
the future of our business, but also address collective, global concerns 

to make a true difference by aligning with the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). We are committed to 
implementing more initiatives, including setting environmental targets  
to address our climate impact and enhancing our overall sustainability 
practices. Accountability and transparency will drive the success of 
these goals and our vision for ESG.

Our focus areas of Governance, Environment, Social and Community 
and Supply Chain Management cover each of our material topics  
and the related initiatives and goals in depth, demonstrating how  
our four strategic drivers, Powerful Brands, Innovative Products, 
Exceptional People and Operational Excellence, guide our business  
in strengthening our sustainability performance.

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportStakeholder Engagement

TTI’s key stakeholder groups are identified as those that have a vested 
interest in our company and can either affect or be affected by our 
operations and performance.* Our sustainability focus areas take into 
account the priorities and concerns of our key stakeholder groups.  
We regularly engage with all our stakeholders, including our 
employees, customers, end-users, suppliers, investors, shareholders, 
regulatory bodies, industry groups and the broader community.

We continued to engage with employees to understand the issues 
that are of utmost concern to them in 2020. We also communicated 
with our customers to understand their key sustainability-related 
challenges and maintained a dialogue with suppliers through online 
platforms, and face-to-face meetings whenever possible. In addition, 
we continued to interact with shareholders to understand their 
concerns and the expectations they have of our ESG performance.

In 2020, we expanded our partnerships with a number of non-profit 
organizations to engage with experts and peers, align on best practices 
and understand our industry’s priority issues. Examples of such 
strategic partnerships include our engagement with the Responsible 
Mineral Initiative (RMI) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

Through the year, we actively participated in virtual roundtables and 
conferences of organizations such as RMI and GRI covering topics 
including waste, water and supply chain.

The table below summarizes the main issues of concern raised by our 
stakeholders, which are reflected in our material topics and addressed 
in this Report. The table also outlines how we engage with our

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | Stakeholder EngagementMateriality Assessment

We continually strive to enhance how we identify and assess the 
issues that are most material to our stakeholders and our business. 
Understanding the concerns of our stakeholders and our global 
sustainability challenges allows us to align our sustainability  
strategy and to identify areas of focus to enhance our sustainability 
performance and reporting. This is also invaluable for identifying  
our risks and opportunities and deepening our collaboration with  
our partners for impact.

The matrix below identifies 13 material topics that were selected based 
on stakeholder concerns as well as the significance of economic, 
environmental and social impacts on our business in 2020. While all 
these topics are important to TTI, the relative ranking presented in this 
assessment is crucial in informing our strategic decision making and 

future target setting. Climate change, ethics and governance, data 
protection and cybersecurity, along with topics in our product-related 
categories – sustainability and safety – ranked highly, emphasizing  
the importance of our comprehensive approach to managing our 
environmental and governance performance. Responsible sourcing, 
health, safety and wellbeing, and talent attraction and engagement 
topics followed, reflecting the importance stakeholders place on 
responsibly engaging with our supply chain and supporting people  
to thrive. For water and biodiversity, we address these risks along  
our value chain and believe they are increasingly critical sustainability 
risks going forward. We will continue to engage stakeholder groups  
on a regular basis to monitor and refine our assessment in order to 
ensure our sustainability strategy remains robust.

Governance

Our material topics have wide-ranging impacts along our 
value chain, therefore embedding sustainability across 
our business by utilizing a strong governance structure 
and robust risk management strategy is key. Embedding 
sustainability in the business means operating responsibly 
by adhering to sound ethics and governance practices 
in accordance with codes and policies that emphasize 
accountability. These codes and policies address both  
offline and online risks. As such, securing the integrity  
of some of our most valuable assets – our online data  
systems and intellectual property – is also an important  
focus of our governance strategy.

Operating responsibly necessitates engaging in global 
initiatives to enhance our performance and transparency to 
create a more sustainable world. In addition to progress on 
alignment with key UNSDGs and our participation in effective 
multi-stakeholder forums, such as the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), our global efforts include partnerships with  
a number of organizations that are working actively to 
promote sustainability and tackle sustainability challenges.

Governance Structure

A well-defined governance structure provides direction for managing 
sustainable practices by assigning clear responsibilities within the 
Company. The TTI Board of Directors together with our ESG Executive 
Committee drive our governance practices. In 2020, increased 
commitment to sustainable practices led to the expansion of our ESG 
Executive Committee which comprises Board members as well as 
executives from different regions and functions. The ESG Executive 
Committee met once in 2020 and will increase its frequency of 
meetings to four times a year in 2021. This Committee works with the 
Board to approve TTI’s sustainability strategy, which is subsequently 
implemented by the ESG Working Committee and each business unit.

The ESG Working Committee includes representatives from different 
business functions and from each region and reports to the ESG 
Executive Committee. The ESG Working Committee enhances  
the Group’s ESG performance by fine-tuning policies, monitoring 
performance and setting goals and targets according to the 
Company’s approved strategy. The ESG Working Committee met  
five times in 2020.

Leaders of regional business units across the company and the  
globe report on their ESG performance and challenges to the  
CEO on a quarterly basis.

88

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | GovernanceRisk Management

Good governance also means managing economic, environmental 
and social risks and capitalizing on opportunities. First and foremost, 
we manage risk by ensuring compliance with regulations and standards 
pertaining to all aspects of our value chain. Responsibility for risk 
management is held locally at the business unit level and by business 
function, with some areas of governance being handled at the corporate 
level. Our internal audit team, which acts independently and reports  
to the Audit Committee, coordinates efforts across functions and 
follows a comprehensive risk assessment process for all business  
units and levels of the Company.

Key elements of our overarching risk mitigation process are 
outlined below.

Of particular note, we are assessing climate risk and managing  
it across our operations through the diversification of our global 
manufacturing base and localization of our supply chain. 
An assessment to identify potential climate risk scenarios, including 
financial impacts and mitigation strategies, is underway and will 
inform our strategy going forward.

Group Risk Mitigation Process

Assurance
Providing independent assurance of the existence and effectiveness of risk management activities and controls in  
TTI’s business operations worldwide.

Audit Planning
Developing an annual audit plan to identify the highest risks to our business. The plan is developed by the Audit Committee 
and TTI’s senior management, taking into account our risk assessment methodology. The plan is reviewed regularly 
throughout the year to reflect any changes in the business.

Engagement Activities
Conducting various engagement activities, including process, financial and compliance audits as well as investigations.  
The results, including deficiencies and remediation plans developed in conjunction with management, are communicated  
to individuals responsible for taking corrective action, including with TTI’s senior management and the Audit Committee,  
as appropriate. The scope and frequency of audits vary, depending on our assessment of operational and financial risks, 
management considerations and the audit plan’s capacity and strategy.

Risk Management
Assessing TTI’s risk management and internal control systems by formulating an impartial opinion on the system and 
reporting the findings to the Audit Committee and the senior managers concerned, as well as following up on issues to 
ensure that they are satisfactorily resolved.

Communications
Maintaining a regular dialogue internally and with TTI’s external auditor.

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and 
Compliance Policies
Sound governance requires a commitment to ethical principles, 
as outlined in TTI’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (CoC). 
This CoC, which is available in 21 languages and communicated 
to all employees, provides guidelines for conducting business 
with transparency and in accordance with all legal requirements. 
The CoC includes TTI’s commitment to ethical behavior and 
provides guidance on how to manage insider information, along 
with acceptance of gifts and other items of value while outlining 
how to avoid conflicts of interest. The CoC also demonstrates 
TTI’s commitment to social responsibility, particularly in relation 
to the protection of human rights, including the prohibition of 
forced and child labor. In addition to the CoC, we have  
a number of global and local policies covered in our Employee 
Handbook, which clearly sets out governance practices and 
expectations for all aspects of our business.

A list of significant policies is summarized on page 91.  
One key guideline is the Anti-corruption Policy, which outlines 
how we maintain anti-corruption standards and prevent 
bribery internally and externally as well as regularly assess 
our operations for corruption risk. As part of these efforts,  
TTI refrains from making any political contributions in any  
of our markets. In China, TTI has been a member of the 
China Enterprise Anti-Fraud Alliance (CEAFA) since 2017. 
We remain committed to working with this non-governmental 
and non-profit cooperative organization to maintain a clean 

business environment. All TTI’s policies are communicated to 
our employees globally through our e-learning platform or 
face to face and are regularly reviewed to ensure compliance 
with laws and regulations. A full list of legal and regulatory 
requirements related to anti-corruption practices that have 
the potential to have a significant impact on our operations 
and performance can be found in Appendix A of our HKEX 
ESG Guide Content Index on our website.

The principles and values in our Code and other policies are 
also applicable to our business partners and set-forth in our 
Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCoC). Key policies 
applicable to partners include the Anti-corruption Policy, 
Policy Against Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, 
Conflict Mineral Policy and the Cobalt Procurement Policy. 
Details can be found in the Responsible Sourcing section  
of this Report on page 128.

Compliance
Our Group Vice President General Counsel and Chief 
Compliance Officer heads compliance globally and reports to 
the CEO and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
The compliance function supports many TTI functions and sets 
our policies, trainings and regulatory interpretation. The 
compliance program is regularly updated and ongoing 
monitoring is conducted by the internal audit team. At the 
regional level, the Group Vice President General Counsel 
and Chief Compliance Officer is assisted by local legal and 
compliance departments.

90

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | GovernanceManagement 
Approach

Global Trade Compliance
An invaluable part of our compliance program is the Global 
Trade Compliance function, which is managed by a team of 
trade compliance professionals across the globe, with our 
Group Vice President of Trade Compliance in the United 
States (U.S) setting policy, strategy and regulatory interpretation. 
The Trade Compliance function is wholly supported by TTI’s 
Executive Management Team and recognized as vital to our 
Company’s global compliance and success.

Global Trade Compliance supports many TTI functions by 
screening entities and persons with whom TTI does business 
to ensure that none of the parties is denied, debarred or 
otherwise proscribed or embargoed by any relevant government. 
Global Trade Compliance also assists Compliance and other 
functions in the analysis of procurement of certain raw materials, 
namely conflict minerals, and helps to identify regions known  
for forced labor and anti-corruption, to mitigate risk.

Complaints and Concerns
To ensure our codes are effective, active reporting of all 
violations is highly encouraged. TTI’s Group Vice President, 
General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer receives 
complaints and concerns directly. These are then investigated 

as appropriate by our internal audit team, the legal or human 
resources departments or an independent third party. 
Complaints can also be made using a third-party operated 
compliance hotline, available 24 hours a day, 7 days per 
week. This allows employees, suppliers and customers,  
or anyone concerned, to report issues. All complaints are 
addressed in confidentiality, anonymity is maintained, and 
remedial actions are then taken, as needed.

Compliance Training and Communication
TTI maintains good governance practices by striving to prevent 
violations through ongoing communication and training. 
Employees and suppliers are required to complete training on 
all codes and policies and to acknowledge their understanding 
of their responsibilities. Every year key personnel are required 
to sign compliance certifications and suppliers are requested 
to sign compliance declarations. Communication on 
compliance is key. We conduct regular training through our 
e-learning platform and in person with our compliance and 
legal departments or external firms. Awareness on compliance  
is also built through periodic quizzes and by placing posters  
in local languages in conspicuous locations at all our sites.

A list of TTI’s key policies and codes are included below.

•  Copies of the CoC along with handouts 
and posters with key points about our 
policies and details on how to report 
violations are available in local languages  
at all premises, including offices, factories 
and dormitories, for those without 
computer access 

In 2020, once again no legal cases of 
corruption, anti-trust, anti-competitive or 
monopoly practices were brought against 
TTI. As per our established approach, we 
continued to educate employees about 
ethical practices with the global launch of 
our new anti-trust training course. 89.3% of 
our employees have been trained on this 
new material in 2020 through our e-learning 
platform and through in-person sessions to 
ensure the delivery of required training to all 
impacted employees. Also, 93.1% of our 
employees have been trained on anti-
corruption through our e-learning platform 
and through in-person sessions to ensure 
the delivery of required training to all impacted 
employees. We also established a new Trade 
Compliance Policy. We are in the process of 
revising our Human Rights and Environmental 
Policies to reflect changing conditions. These 
updated policies will be put forward to the 
Board in 2021.

Our complaint reporting system remained 
effective, with a total of 38 complaints received 
and investigated in a timely manner in 2020. 
All complaints were resolved in 2020 except 

training on anti-trust and a new policy on 
trade compliance to all employees globally

one, which remained open in 2021. The sales 
revenue of the company grew by 28% in 2020 
over 2019, so the fact that the number of 
complaints increased over 2019 can be 
attributed to our growth. Of the 38 complaints, 
18 were reported through the complaint 
hotline, 9 were anonymous emails, 4 complaints 
came from TTI employees and 7 came from 
TTI management. One complaint was made 
directly to the Group Vice President, General 
Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer and 
all complaints were investigated thoroughly. 
Of the complaints, 2 alleged fraud, 12 were 
employment-related claims or regarding 
violations of company policy, 2 alleged 
collusion, 1 alleged corruption, 3 alleged 
bribery, 5 complaints were against suppliers, 
1 was from a customer complaining about 
brand upgrades and 12 complaints were with 
insufficient evidence and information for 
further investigation. Complaints with merit 
were managed with appropriate corrective 
action, including termination of employment, 
payment of penalties or immediate remediation. 
Detailed information about complaints and 
corrective measures were reported to both 
management and the Audit Committee.

relevant legal requirements including Europe’s General Data 
Protection Regulation, which TTI has been compliant with 
since 2018. Our IT department monitors all computer systems 
to ensure they are covered by sound authorization 
management processes. Procedures protecting our data 
systems are outlined in eight separate global security policies.

TTI follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Cybersecurity Framework, which defines our approach to 

cybersecurity – including the protection of customer data,  
the growth of our business and management of IP. Led by our 
Group Director Cybersecurity, our Informational Technology 
Steering Committee (ITSC) meets monthly to ensure that TTI’s 
systems are well managed.

Intellectual Property
Our security protocol covers TTI’s intellectual property 
portfolio, which includes patents, trademarks, logos, 
copyrights, software and trade secrets. Management of our IP 
is conducted according to procedures outlining proper usage 
and protection from infringement by and of others. We 
champion innovation among our employees by encouraging 
inventions, discoveries, new ideas and concepts. Our patent 
invention award mechanism serves to further drive creativity. 
We continue to support the documentation of ownership of all 
such IP and train our employees not to use protected IP out of 
respect for the IP rights of others.

our ability to proactively address risk before loss occurs

Progress  
in 2020

Ensuring compliance with the California Consumer Privacy 
Act from January 2020 was a key focus for TTI in 2019. This 
led to the launch of a new training program and the review of 
our data privacy policies and websites. Important cybersecurity 
projects initiated in 2020 included cybersecurity assessments 
of all businesses, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) 
roll outs, multifactor authentication for email and VPN as well 
as vulnerability scanning and reporting.

In 2020, there was one substantiated complaint concerning 
breaches of customer privacy and data. TTI identified 
unauthorized access to one of our business unit’s systems. 
Through quick action via our internal teams and in coordination 
with our security partners, TTI did not experience loss of 
customer data or IP. TTI complied with all applicable laws 
and regulations in addressing the incident.

Environmental Management

In 2020, our environmental management strategy has continued  
to focus on developing climate resilience, managing our footprint 
responsibly and creating products that further circularity in our 
operations. We have established goals and initiatives to address  
the impacts associated with each of our material topics of climate 
change, water, resources, chemicals and waste, sustainable products 
and biodiversity. 

TTI’s ESG Executive Committee is responsible for setting our 
environmental management strategy, with oversight provided by the 
Board. The Committee also ensures sufficient resources are allocated 
for strategy implementation across our global business units. Progress 
in achieving our goals is monitored and evaluated, with actions for 
improvement identified where needed. The success of our strategy is 
based on ensuring that our goals are well understood and key initiatives 
are implemented across our markets. Our ESG Working Committee and 
global Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) teams, are responsible for 
coordinating environmental management efforts and leading the 
development and implementation of awareness-raising and training 
programs internally.

All our manufacturing sites have comprehensive Environmental 
Management Systems (EMS) in place. In 2020, TTI AIP, our primary 
manufacturing site, along with TTI ELC, our largest warehouse and 
distribution center and TTI GMBH, respectively, in EMEA were all 
EMS certified and remained compliant with International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 14001 EMS and 9001 quality standards. 
Our environmental management policies encourage employees to 
champion sustainable practices across offices and manufacturing sites. 
Employees receive training so they are able to play an active part in 
improving our environmental performance. Training on EMS and EHS  
is delivered through both e-learning platforms and in-person sessions. 

All of our operations and business partners are required to meet 
regulatory requirements, ensuring TTI’s performance is in line with 
the environmental expectations of our stakeholders. For a full list of 
legal and regulatory requirements that have the potential to have a 
significant impact on our operations and performance, please refer to 
Appendix A of our HKEX ESG Guide Content Index on our website. 
We have comprehensive grievance mechanisms in place, which are 
available to all stakeholders who wish to raise issues, concerns or 
complaints. More details can be found in the Ethics and Governance 
section of this Report.

With the aim of increasing transparency and accountability, a large 
part of our effort is focused on measuring environmental performance 
across our markets using ESG data collection and analysis software. 
Detailed metrics for GHG emissions, energy, water and packaging 
consumption and hazardous and non-hazardous waste, can be found 
in the Performance Metrics of this Report.

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | EnvironmentClimate Change

Why it’s 
Important

In 2020, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood 
published by the World Economic Forum were all related  
to climate and environmental issues. The planet has 
limited resources and global warming has irreversible 
impacts. Climate resilience and a reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions is paramount for the long-term health of our 
business, suppliers, partners, communities and the planet.

Goals

We strive to work with global partners to strengthen  
our capacity to mitigate climate change and  
climate-related impacts.

Impact along the Value Chain

•  # of fuel efficient and electric vehicles

•  # of partnerships and accomplishments

Management 
Approach

Climate change is one of the most crucial challenges facing 
society today. TTI is in the process of thoroughly assessing our 
climate risk, sharing information and strategizing how we can 
reduce our environmental impact. We are building climate 
resilience along the value chain and focusing on reducing 
GHG emissions and consuming energy efficiently with the aim 
of transitioning to renewable sources. While we plan to 
announce science-based targets for GHG emission reduction 
in our next report, we took steps in 2020 to diversify our 
manufacturing and supply chains to manage climate risk, 
including extreme weather events over the long term.  
Our diversification strategy manages risk by cultivating close 
relationships with our business partners to maintain high 
environmental and safety standards across our value chain.  
It also enables us to reduce the transportation journey of goods 
and to integrate sustainability features into new facilities.

Energy and Emissions
Reducing air and GHG emissions is fundamental to addressing 
our contribution to climate change. The main sources of these 
emissions arise from our manufacturing processes, office 
energy consumption, transportation and the supply chain.  
Air emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), 

nitrous oxide (N2O), sulphur oxide (SOx) and fine particulate 
matter (PM) emitted from cars, trucks and other small 
machinery, and from combustion processes to generate 
electricity for manufacturing, lighting, building management 
systems, heating and cooling, fluorinated gases, such as 
R-404a, are also consumed as refrigerants.

We continue to expand our disclosure of GHG emissions  
as we strive to track metrics across all markets. Our Scope 1,  
2 and part of 3 emission data is included in our Performance 
Metrics for those business units where data is available. 
Scope 1 emissions arise from onsite sources identified above 
and Scope 2 indirectly from purchased electricity. Part of 
Scope 3 emissions arise from business travel and other forms 
of transportation, as well as our consumption of water and 
generation of waste. We are setting a carbon reduction target 
and roadmap for TTI’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on 
analysis of energy efficiency and renewable energy 
technology and procurement opportunities. We are also 
mapping Scope 3 emissions along our value chain and 
identifying opportunities for the business to engage in GHG 
emission reduction initiatives beyond our direct operations.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

97

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | EnvironmentManagement 
Approach

Managing our energy footprint is a substantive challenge.  
Our priorities are to adopt renewable sources of energy and 
manage energy efficiently as increased production levels 
require higher levels of consumption. As such, our approach 
continues to include timely maintenance of air-conditioning, 
heating, ventilation and building management systems to 
ensure efficient consumption and healthy indoor air quality. 
We also adopt efficient LED lighting and adjust lighting 

levels based on occupancy and availability of natural light. 
TTI is working toward adopting further renewable sources of 
energy across some of our key manufacturing operations.  
At new sites, such as our factory in Vietnam, we are introducing 
environmental requirements in the design and construction 
of buildings, as well as systems and equipment, taking into 
consideration measures on energy efficiency, renewable 
energy procurement and water conservation.

Key  
Initiatives

Our business units took the following measures to decrease 
GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency in 2020:

•  Transitioning to electric vehicles at some of our sites in 

Australia, New Zealand and EMEA

•  Incorporating environmental features into new and 

existing buildings

•  Conducting external energy audits to monitor progress 

•  Installing LED lights and light sensors in meeting rooms 

and offices

•  Turning down heating, ventilation and air conditioning 

(HVAC) when not in use, resealing windows and updating 
equipment for energy and noise reduction

•  Using a low carbon electricity supply such as nuclear, solar 

PV, wind and hydropower

•  Replacing equipment with energy-efficient smart boilers that 
have variable speed pumps. One operation in EMEA uses 
around 11% less gas to heat premises as a result

•  Utilizing rail instead of petrol-fueled trucks to move goods 

across borders and avoiding airfreight when possible

Progress  
in 2020

A lockdown of non-essential services in many of our markets 
around the globe resulted in a portion of office-based employees 
transitioning to remote working environments in 2020.  
This resulted in a 14% reduction in GHG emission carbon 
dioxide equivalent tCO2e (Scope 1, 2 and 3) intensity per 
production value US$ million globally.

Air and GHG Emissions
In 2020, TTI did not have any incidents of non-compliance 
with emission regulations. Our total GHG emissions in 2020 
amounted to 220,379 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO2e), an increase of 22% in absolute emissions and a 
decrease of 14% based on production value US$ million over 
2019. As part of our upstream and downstream assessment 
within our value chain, TTI is working to set and disclose 
science-based targets for reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions by 2030.

TTI AIP GHG Emissions In Depth
In 2020, TTI AIP’s total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) 
decreased by 3% intensity per production value US$ million. 
AIP’s GHG Scope 1 emissions intensity decreased by 13% 
per production value US$ million due to our Continuous 
Improvement Program (CIP) which is designed to reduce energy 
consumption in our operations despite an increase in production 
of 7%. TTI AIP’s Scope 2 emissions intensity decreased by  

2% per production value and Scope 3 emissions intensity 
decreased by 2% per production value.

Energy
TTI’s total electricity consumption in 2020 amounted to 
228,126,948 kWh. This was 12% higher than 2019 figures 
due to higher levels of production to meet demand.

Consumption figures by region are included in the 
Performance Metrics. 

TTI AIP Energy In Depth
At TTI AIP, manufacturing output increased by approximately 
7% between 2019 and 2020. As a result, overall electricity 
consumption increased by approximately 6% in 2020 over  
the previous year, however, intensity decreased by 1%.  
The consumption and intensity per production value US$ 
million of natural gas also decreased by over 14% and 20% 
respectively compared to 2019 due to our CIP.

Our global locations consist of leased and owned properties 
where a number of them have been certified in Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). At our Hong Kong 
headquarters, the site received the LEED certificate from  
the US Green Building Council in 2020. Looking forward,  
we aim to achieve a LEED certification for our new factory  
site in Vietnam.

New Sites
An increasingly important practice when it 
comes to managing risk is the diversification 
of our manufacturing base across the globe. 
This involves developing closer ties to new 
markets by working with local suppliers.  
TTI is expanding new sites in Vietnam, 
Mexico and the United States. Details of 
our operations in these markets in 2020 and 
going forward are as follows.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In June 2020 we 
announced an investment of US$650 million 
to build a plant and also establish a new 
innovation center in Ho Chi Minh City.  
The plant and the R&D center will be LEED 
certified by the US Green Building Council 
and will enable us to tap into increased 
renewable energy sources to meet our energy 
needs, increasing the global percentage of 
energy procured from renewable sources.

Torreón, Mexico. Our new facility in Mexico 
covers an area of 70,606 square meters and 
employed 1,785 people as of December 2020.

United States
Anderson County, South Carolina. Our new 
manufacturing plant and warehouse in 
Anderson County will cover an area of over 
92,903 square meters. The new facility will 
support production and assembly operations 
and include a reconditioning plant.  
This US$100 million investment will create 
525 new jobs over the next several years.

a tool repair and warehousing space.  
Our MILWAUKEE brand’s investment in this 
facility, which will employ more than 450 
people, is US$6.75 million.

West Bend, Wisconsin. In 2020, plans  
were announced to build a new hand tool 
manufacturing plant in West Bend.

Greer, South Carolina. A new distribution 
center for TTIFC is expected to be operational 
by March 2021 and completed in the latter 
half of 2021. This investment will create 134 
new jobs.

Through diversification we aim to maintain 
high standards across our supply chain and 
reduce our environmental impact by, for 
example, minimizing the transportation of 
goods and prioritizing key elements of 
environmental design when planning our 
new buildings. Furthermore, as we become 
deeply entrenched in these markets, we are 
able to have a positive impact on the living 
conditions, educational prospects and the 
economic development of local communities. 
For example, in Vietnam TTI is already 
working with local universities to recruit 
potential talent for our R&D center.

responsible consumption. An important step 
in our overall water management strategy is 
understanding which areas are most affected 
by water scarcity. Accordingly, we aim to 
reduce absolute water withdrawal at the sites 
where water scarcity is a risk. Efficient usage 
of water and the proper management of 
wastewater discharge remain our main focus. 
We continue to improve our approach  
to water management by implementing 
conservation initiatives and monitoring usage 
and potential leakage. All our water needs 
are adequately met by local, municipal 
sources, and we stringently comply with 
relevant regulations pertaining to water 
withdrawal and wastewater discharge.

in 2020

•  Using treated greywater to flush toilets

•  Collecting rainwater for reuse

In 2020, there were no incidents of 
non-compliance with water management 
regulations across our operations.  
TTI’s total water consumption amounted  
to 617,183 m3. The 10% increase in 
consumption when compared to the 
previous year was due to higher levels of 
production in our manufacturing facilities. 
Total wastewater produced also went up  
by 10% representing a 9% increase in the 
discharge of treated effluent, with a 12% 
increase in the consumption of recycled 
water, when compared to 2019. TTI Group’s

Metrics table on page 132.

Our water conservation efforts and goals are 
set at the group level and are implemented 
through water saving plans. Measures 
include using recycled water for flushing, 
collecting rainwater for gardening and 
cleaning outdoor areas, carrying out regular 
inspections to check for hidden water 
leakage along buried water pipe networks 
and installing motion sensors and 
timercontrolled taps on washbasins. We also 
do extensive work in providing access to safe 
water resources while providing sanitation 
training in the communities where we 
operate. These community efforts are 
especially important given the heightened 
need for clean water and proper hygiene to 
manage the COVID-19 pandemic. More 
details on these programs can be found in 
the Community Investment and Engagement 
sections of this Report.

•  Inspecting ground dampness along water 
supply pipe networks and performing 
ultrasound detection tests annually to

options for hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition, 
we always ensure that hazardous waste is picked up by 
licensed professionals, for safe disposal. Our waste management 
policies apply to all our operations globally. At each site, 
employees are trained on the appropriate handling of waste 
and members of our EHS teams ensure that resources are 
provided to comply with these policies and any new regulations. 
For example, in 2020, 750 employees in China received 
training on EHS and hazardous waste regulations and 
compliance requirements following the introduction of new 
PRC laws on hazardous waste. We also conduct regular 
waste management audits internally and over the years have 
appointed independent auditors to review our waste 
management processes.

In 2020, we initiated a review of waste generated globally to 
set reduction targets. We also expanded our partnerships 
with a number of recyclers. This not only diverts waste from 
disposal, but establishes circular economy practices for the 
capture and reuse of valuable resources.

Packaging and Paper
Packaging and paper management remains a global priority 
for TTI. As production volumes increase, our focus is on 
utilizing less material to conserve resources and make the 
transportation of products more efficient. We also strive to 
adopt reduced-impact materials where possible. The most 
common materials we use for packaging include paper for 
boxes, cartons and die cut sheets, and plastic for polybags, 
bubble bags, clamshells and tool bags. We continue to 
expand our usage of biodegradable packaging and paper  
in packaging products and opt for recycled materials, using 
corrugated cardboard, 70% of which is made of recycled 
paper pulp, honeycomb board, chipboard, paperboard and/ 
or molded pulp where possible.

Reducing the use of polybags continues to be a priority. Other 
efforts in 2020 have been a program to remove Expanded 
Polystyrene (EPS) foam from our packaging, implementing 
soya ink printing which is more environmentally responsible 
and initiating a packaging material weight reduction program. 
As part of our packaging initiatives, we continue to use 100% 
recycled paper and manage the volume of instruction

Approach

manuals and safety literature. To reduce page count and 
manual volume, we have eliminated redundant content, 
implemented new templates, replaced text with graphics, 
adopted simpler instructions for spare parts and consumables 
and decreased paper weight.

Batteries
Batteries are core to the functionality of our products and 
reducing our environmental footprint along the value chain. 
Our batteries are designed to be interchangeable within each 
network to avoid the production and wastage of multiple 
batteries. Our global recycling partnerships are critical for 
increasing the capture and recycling rate of batteries and 
products, which have reached the end of their useful lives. 
Our batteries, and products containing batteries, continue to 
be recycled through various organizations across our markets. 
One such organization, Call2Recycle®, recycles our rechargeable 
batteries in North America. More information on this partnership 
can be found in the TTI and Call2Recycle® Sustainability 
Partnership section on page 104. In addition, battery 
recycling partnerships continue with other partners in North 
America, Australia and New Zealand, EMEA, and Asia.

Chemicals
While our approach prioritizes reducing chemical consumption, 
we have stringent policies to ensure the safe and proper 
management of unavoidable chemicals and hazardous waste,  
in compliance with all relevant regulations. We are subject to a 
variety of legal, industry-specific requirements covering chemical 
use, including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 
in Europe and parts of Asia, the Regulation on Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) 
in the EU and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the 
United States. Hazardous Substances Free (HSF) initiatives are 
fully integrated into our product development process and local 
as well as customer-specific HSF requirements are part of the 
product evaluation and acceptance criteria for our engineering 

teams. A list of high-risk materials and components is 
maintained as part of our operating instructions and is 
periodically reviewed and amended when necessary.

TTI avoids the use of REACH’s substances of very high 
concern in our products whenever possible. We have our 
own in-house accredited chemical testing laboratory, which 
enables verification testing for RoHS substances. When 
starting a new development project, our teams carry out  
a thorough risk analysis to identify potentially hazardous 
components. For these components, suppliers are required 
to provide test reports from TTI-approved, third-party 
accredited testing laboratories, verifying the safety  
of components. 

Circularity and Sustainable Materials
While minimizing resource use is our priority, we also have  
initiatives for reusing, recycling and promoting circularity in  
our operations and along our value chain whenever we can.  
In the PRC, our processes have been modified to include  
the dismantling of all surplus products and those used for 
reliability testing so the components can be assessed for 
possible reuse or recycling. In 2020, we entered into new 
partnerships with recyclers having patented technology to 
recover valuable materials that can be repurposed. We also 
hope to introduce these recovered components into our  
own supply chain when possible.

Another initiative in nascent stages is the testing of 
biodegradable materials for use in plastic cases that  
carry our power tools. This initiative at TTI factories  
involves extensive work by our R&D teams who are  
striving to reduce waste at all stages of our product  
lifecycle. More information on our circularity initiatives  
and use of biodegradable materials can be found in  
our Sustainable Products section.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | EnvironmentKey  
Initiatives

Local regulations and building management 
procedures determine how our resources, 
chemicals and waste are managed in each 
of our locations. Initiatives include:

•  Utilizing electronic filing systems to save 

paper where possible 

•  Returning paint containers to suppliers  

for reuse

ECO Responsible

Progress  
in 2020

•  Providing recycling training for employees 
and working with trade associations to 
develop content on proper recycling of  
our products 

•  Implementing programs for recycling, 
including for paper, cardboard, scrap 
metal, bottles and cans, plastic, oil, wood 
pallets, lightbulbs, printer cartridges and 
toners, coffee grounds and food waste

Waste
In 2020, there were no incidents of 
non-compliance with waste management 
regulations. TTI produced 51,756 tonnes of 
non-hazardous waste and 2,244 tonnes of 
hazardous waste. Our non-hazardous waste 
increased by 36% due to increases at our 
Americas, Asia and EMEA operations.  
The increase was due to an increase in 
manufacturing and production activities. 
Our overall hazardous waste decreased by 
30% reflecting decreases in most regions 
due to our many initiatives to minimize 
waste. Data on our waste by region can be 
found in our Performance Metrics.

At TTI AIP, non-hazardous waste generation 
increased by 4% and hazardous waste 
decreased by 7%. Overall this represented 
a decrease in total waste intensity of 3%. 
This was due to our comprehensive waste 
reduction efforts. TTI made some progress 
in recycling waste, with a 25% increase  
in recycling. This represented a 28% increase 
in non-hazardous waste recycling and a 0.5% 
increase in hazardous waste recycling across 
operations. TTI AIP also saw a 15% increase 
in waste recycling, mostly attributable to the 
recycling of non-hazardous waste products.

Packaging and Paper
In 2020, TTI saw a significant increase in 
packaging used due to a surge in products 
manufactured. While TTI AIP had an increase 
in packaging volume, 92.5% of materials in 
our packaging in 2020 were from recycled 
material compared to 91.4% in 2019.

•  Recycling batteries and power tool skins to 
recover materials such as steel, copper 
and aluminium which is then returned to 
the manufacturing sector to produce 
mixed metal dust

•  Participating in government initiatives  

for the safe disposal of WEEE 
electrical equipment 

While an increased number of products 
invariably means more packaging, we made 
important progress in minimizing impact 
through eco-measures that resulted in 
significant cost savings for our business. 
Some examples include:

•  Changing our EPS foam packaging to 
molded pulp packaging, which saved  
1.42 tonnes of plastic and 2.5 tonnes  
of CO2 per year

•  Implementing half sleeve instead of full 

sleeve packaging designs which resulted 
in annual savings of 180 tonnes of paper, 
the equivalent of 4,147 trees and 1,800 
tonnes of water per year. This contribued 
to a CO2 reduction of 147 tonnes per year

•  New design elements replacing carton 

flaps in place of pulp mold which led to  
a decrease in package size by 38% 
resulting in savings of 46 tonnes of paper, 
909 trees and 379 tonnes of water, with a 
CO2 reduction of 38 tonnes per year

•  Changing the material and size of die cut 
sheets for tool packaging, resulting in 
savings of 66.8 tonnes of paper (a 29% 
reduction for this particular packing), 
1,603 trees, 668 tonnes of water and  
a CO2 reduction of 54.7 tonnes

Batteries
In 2020 we collaborated with partners to 
collect and recycle more than 530 tonnes  
of batteries.

TTI and Call2Recycle® Partnership for 
Sustainability
For over 20 years, TTI has partnered with 
Call2Recycle® to ensure that our batteries 
and products containing batteries are 
responsibly recycled when they reach their 
end of life. TTI pays stewardship fees to 
Call2Recycle® based on North American 
battery and battery product sales. 
Call2Recycle®’s North American collection 
network has over 25,000 collection sites, 
including local household hazardous waste 
sites and national retailers where consumers 
can drop-off their batteries for recycling.

TTI has also implemented a number of 
recycling incentive schemes in partnership 
with Call2Recycle®. These have included 
issuing battery safety and recycling guides  
to customers, developing infographics 

showing end users the impact of battery 
recycling over the years and creating a pilot 
‘at home’ recycling kit for online battery 
purchases through retailers. Our RYOBI line 
also created a safe battery disposal video, 
viewed by thousands of committed battery 
recyclers on our website and on YouTube. In 
2020, Milwaukee worked with Call2Recycle® 
to provide an at-home battery recycling 
solution for customers. Call2Recycle® sent 
1,186 recycling kits directly to customers 
and 50% of the kits were returned for 
recycling. This program resulted in close to 
one additional tonne of end-of-life batteries 
being transported compliantly and recycled 
responsibly. Looking forward, we are 
planning to expand this program to all 
our brands.

In recognition of our recycling efforts, 
Milwaukee was designated as a 2020 Top 
100 Leader in Sustainability for diverting 
more than 106 tonnes of batteries through 
the Call2Recycle® battery collection and 
recycling program. Call2Recycle® recognized 
all award recipients with a tree donation to 
the National Forest Foundation’s ‘50 Million 
for their Forests’ campaign.

Management 
Approach

Our product development process – from identifying next 
generation of products, to designing and manufacturing 
through to after sales – aims to reduce environmental impact 
and improve social conditions along our value chain. Our 
priority has always been on R&D and in the past few years, 
our focus is increasingly on developing energy-efficient, clean 
technologies and adopting sustainable materials.

Responsible Products
In developing products, our R&D teams consider 
recyclability, repairability and longevity of the products.  
In 2020, we continued our value engineering programs  
and expanded the number of lifecycle assessments within 
our key product categories. As a result of these initiatives,  
we aim to achieve reductions in shape, weight and use of 
materials while utilizing more sustainable options, driving 
innovation, reducing GHG emissions and improving resource 
efficiency and durability.

We have a number of sustainable products and initiatives 
that utilize clean technology options. These include:

•  The launch and expansion of the RYOBI WHISPER 
Brushless Jet Fan Blower products in 2020, which  
deliver GAS-LIKE POWERTM performance with reduced 
noise pollution 

•  Low-emission generators 

•  MILWAUKEE line of LED lights 

•  Next generation of RYOBI ONE+ HP brushless series with 

subcompact design

Championing Innovation
A key area where we continue to champion innovation is 
through our gas to cordless initiative. TTI is an industry 
leader in the conversion of gas-powered tools to cordless 
tools. The development of cordless tools is driving both 
environmental and safety improvements. Our cordless 
products include the MILWAUKEE MX FUEL equipment 
system and the RYOBI Cordless Lawn Mower along with our 
range of other outdoor power equipment. The RYOBI Lawn 
Mower in particular is well known for its environmentally-
responsible features. 

•  Gas to cordless innovations, for example our MILWAUKEE 

light equipment system (MX FUEL), along with our  
M18 and M12 systems, and the RYOBI 40V cordless 
system containing 52 products, lawn mowers and  
outdoor power equipment 

TTI’s pioneering lithium battery pack technology, which 
powers our cordless tools, performs even better and more 
efficiently today through battery pack construction,  
lithium-ion cells within the pack and the electronics within 
the battery pack. The TTI battery packs are engineered to

Approach

enable maximum battery compatibility 
among tools. As a result of this compatibility 
feature, batteries and tools from a previous 
generation can also be used with newly-
launched batteries and tools. This allows a 
customer to use the same battery pack with 
all the tools of each network, which include 
213 tools for the MILWAUKEE M18 system, 
125 tools for the MILWAUKEE M12 system, 
10 products for the MILWAUKEE MX FUEL 
range, and over 182 tools for the RYOBI 
ONE+ system. In many cases, our batteries 
have a gauge that displays the remaining 
charge available, and can operate at 
sub-zero temperatures. These unique 
features serve to not only enhance 
functionality, but also minimize waste  
and excess consumption.

Product Repair and Refurbishing Program
We have also expanded our product 
reconditioning program, which supports 

Key  
Initiatives

Our business units are taking action to

repair and refurbishment of tools. This is an 
important aspect of our circularity effort as it 
extends the lifecycle of our products without 
compromising on quality. In 2020, 808,004 
products were repaired through service 
centers and 495,793 refurbished products 
were sold.

Product refurbishment allows 80% of the 
original product to be reused. As a first step, 
all products, including batteries and chargers, 
are carefully inspected for any mechanical 
issues. These are then repaired by 
manufacturer-trained technicians, who use 
replacement parts from TTI’s factory. After 
this, testing is conducted to ensure products 
are working at optimal standards before they 
are packaged as certified, pre-owned units. 
Refurbished products are sold through our 
Direct Tool Factory Outlets with a one-year 
warranty. In 2020, the number of factory 
outlets expanded to 37.

•  Striving to reduce the number of parts  

and components in products

•  Ensuring all key product categories 

undergo lifecycle assessment

•  Designing all products with ease of repair, 
simple disassembly features and with 
recyclability and longevity in mind

Progress  
in 2020

In 2020, we continued to look holistically at 
our product lifecycle to integrate sustainability 
attributes and actions along the value chain. 
In Asia, this involved a thoroughly collaborative 
and cross-sectional team effort to analyze 
and understand the relative impacts of our 
products through lifecycle assessment and 
carbon footprint analysis. The information 
gathered will be used to create a sustainable 
design guide for future products.

As we make strides toward innovations that 
reduce environmental impact, we also 
continue to prioritize the safety of our 
employees and customers and develop 
products that meet the need for heightened 
health and safety in the community. We will 
continue to develop sustainable products to 
meet the needs of customers and the wider 
community in the future.

Why it’s 
Important

Goals

Healthy ecosystems, supporting air, soil and water quality,  
as well as species and habitat diversity, are key to the 
long-term survival of our business and the wellbeing of  
the communities where we operate.

We aim to protect the ecosystems around us by committing 
to responsible production and consumption and impact 
reduction through the adoption of global best practices and 
promotion of partnerships.

Impact along the Value Chain

KPIs

•  Source reduced impact materials

•  Promote reuse of materials and increase recycling

•  Promote eco-certified buildings 

Management 
Approach

Protecting biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, for both 
species and habitats, are necessary in order to help 
safeguard our planet. Responsibly managing our footprint –  
from material selection and sourcing, resource conservation 
and adopting renewable energy, to redesigning products and 
processes for circularity – is an opportunity for us to do things 
differently, to lead and to effect change. Integrating factors 
that contribute to restoring and protecting biodiversity in our 
operations and our engagement with suppliers, customers 
and consumers, is essential across our value chain.

As outlined in the Sustainable Products section of this 
Report, whenever we can, we are designing our products and 
processes to incorporate sustainable materials, adopting or 
providing clean technology, and embedding circularity 
principles to recover valuable resources and reduce pollution. 
We strive to develop our manufacturing and operating 
locations in a way that minimizes impacts on local ecology, 
including habitat and species diversity. We aim to accomplish 
this at our new factory site in Vietnam by attaining LEED 

certification for our facility. We also work to conserve 
biodiversity and protect habitats in our supply chain by 
responsibly sourcing materials, minerals and metals in 
particular, and amplifying this through collective industry 
engagement with suppliers and partners such as the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Responsible 
Business Alliance (RBA).

In 2020, TTI renewed our RMI membership and expanded it 
to become a supporter member of the RBA, a coalition of 
leading companies working to improve efficiency and social, 
ethical and environmental responsibility in the global supply 
chain. We fully support the vision and the goals of the RBA, 
which involve driving sustainable value for workers, the 
environment and business by adopting best practices. 
Through our partnership with organizations such as the RBA, 
we hope to collaborate with like-minded companies and other 
stakeholders to improve environmental conditions in 
ecosystems throughout our value chain. 

Key  
Initiatives

•  Our operation in Mexico has analyzed the direct and 
indirect impacts of manufacturing plants and the 
associated transport infrastructure on biodiversity and 
determined there is no flora or vegetation that is impacted 
by the development of this facility

A Fair Work Environment
Employee Benefits and Compensation
We consider employee benefits to be a valuable 
part of working at TTI. The wellbeing of our 
employees is very important and this is reflected 
in our practice of ensuring employees receive 
benefits above and beyond what is legally 
mandated. Each of our business units puts 
special emphasis on providing incentives 
that are competitive and relevant to their 
local employees.

Human and Labor Rights
TTI takes human and labor rights very seriously. 
We comply with all international, national, 
state and local employment laws, in addition 
to International Labour Organization (ILO) core 
labor standards, to ensure our workers are 
treated fairly. This means proper oversight of 
legal working age, hours and working permits 
across our markets and supply chain. We have 
policies in place that stipulate our zero-tolerance 
approach to forced and child labor. Measures 
to support policy implementation include 
checking identification cards and drivers’ 
licenses to confirm the age of workers, as 

well as ensuring young individuals above the 
legal working age have limited working hours, 
receive adequate training and are not exposed 
to hazardous work. In addition, we ensure 
freedom of association and collective 
bargaining rights are respected according to 
local regulations. Workers can express their 
concerns and opinions through trade unions 
as well as through TTI’s established channels.

Training and Development
Employee training needs and targets are 
determined during annual performance 
reviews conducted by managers. Professional 
development plans are created according to 
job function, with training sessions covering 
a variety of subjects from compliance, 
leadership, management skills to product 
technical training, marketing and customer 
service skills. TTI supports a wide range of 
training opportunities from coaching and 
mentorship, seminars and conferences to 
continuing education. We provide financial 
support including sponsorships and full 
reimbursement of fees for employees who 
embark on learning initiatives.

•  Facilitating internal hiring for all vacancies 
and transferring employees to different 
business units to maintain full employment

•  Providing unemployment insurance for 

employees in certain markets

In 2020, TTI employees engaged in 2,362 
courses through the e-learning platforms, this 
was equivalent to 175,826 training hours. 
Average training hours completed by region 
can be found in our Performance Metrics.

Key  
Initiatives

Progress  
in 2020

Many in-house employee development 
programs are conducted using our online 
platform, Learn TTI and other e-learning 
platforms. These platforms provide a 
spectrum of learning opportunities from 
mandatory courses on compliance to 
job-specific training. In addition to 
e-learning, we provide development 
opportunities through Lunch-n-Learn 
sessions conducted by employees or  
outside speakers.

Leadership Development Program (LDP)
Our investment in employee development  
is also reflected in our longstanding 
recruitment practices that have brought 
college graduates from over 100 global 

In 2020, it was imperative that our talent 
engagement efforts include appropriate 
measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This involved instituting Work From Home 
(WFH) measures for all employees for whom 
this arrangement was appropriate, resulting 
in shifting many of our sales and marketing 
offices to remote working arrangements, 
while safely maintaining office access for  
a small percentage of employees who  
were needed onsite. More details on our 
comprehensive measures to address the 
COVID-19 pandemic can be found in the 
Health, Safety and Wellbeing section of 
this Report.

Apart from COVID-19 pandemic response 
management, our talent engagement 
initiatives centered on learning and 
development opportunities such as:

•  Providing online and face-to-face courses 
on topics that range from legal, safety and 
compliance issues to behavioral, soft 

Our commitment to developing Exceptional 
People remained steadfast despite the 
challenges presented by the COVID-19 
pandemic. While some external and onsite 
training initiatives were re-scheduled in 
2020, we continued to champion learning 
initiatives. Our recruitment programs also 
forged ahead even while third-party services 
had to be minimized.

Why it’s 
Important

The health, safety and wellbeing of our people is important 
to attract talent, retain a productive workforce and ensure 
business continuity and innovation.

Impact along the Value Chain

Goals

We aim to maintain a fair and safe working environment 
where our people remain engaged and productive.

Management 
Approach

Our policies on wellbeing, health and safety are designed to 
improve lives and build on our approach to championing 
human and labor rights.

Employee Wellbeing
Employee health and safety go hand in hand with wellbeing. 
Enhancing employee wellbeing entails offering competitive 
benefits including parental leave and healthy lifestyle initiatives 
that go beyond legal requirements. Details on the number of 
TTI employees who took parental leave can be found in our 
Performance Metrics. Each of our business units provides 
benefits to support healthy and motivated employees.

Safety at Work
Fair treatment of all workers extends to assurance of safety 
at work. Our Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) and 
Occupational Hazard Management Policies ensure we 
comply with all legal requirements, identifying risks and 
hazards to minimize the potential injury or harm that may 
result. These policies also include provisions for investigating 
any violations and taking appropriate remedial actions.  
In line with our practice of meeting high industry standards, 
our new factories in Vietnam were the latest facilities to achieve 
ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management system 
certification in 2020.

A key part of our safety protocol is implementing thorough 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) training in all markets. 
A complete list of relevant human and labor rights, along with 
health and safety legal and regulatory requirements that have 
the potential to have a significant impact to TTI’s operations 
and performance can be found in Appendix A of our HKEX 
ESG Guide Content Index on our website.

In 2020, our health and safety efforts were focused on 
managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Our efforts included 
innovative ways to distribute information about the COVID-19 
pandemic and communicate protocols on health concerns and 
travel, as well as conducting contact tracing. Our business units 
set up committees and crisis management teams that regularly 
met and implemented preventive measures such as body 
temperature checks, mask wearing, social distancing, installing 
plastic barriers for safety, placing hand sanitizing stations in 
work areas and maintaining healthy indoor air quality and 
adequate ventilation. We also provided masks and gloves  
to manufacturing, distribution, sales and other employees,  
and increased daily cleaning protocols for all offices and 
manufacturing sites and closed facilities when necessary.

Initiatives

In 2020, the health and wellbeing of our employees became 
an even bigger focus. Some measures taken by business 
units to address the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows:

•  Setting up effective and real-time health declaration and 
reporting mechanisms for TTI’s employees and visitors

•  Instituting temperature checks and requiring completion  
of a COVID-19 pandemic screening questionnaire for 
employees and others before entering any facility

•  Developing online fitness classes, virtual games and social 

events to promote employee wellness

•  Implementing enhanced mental health programs to ensure 

employees have support within the workplace

•  Keeping close contact with local authorities and health 

departments to understand requirements, institute policies 
and seek support

•  Establishing a crisis management response strategy to 
ensure both business continuity for TTI as well as job 
security and safety for employees

•  Increasing wages temporarily to essential manufacturing 

and distribution facility employees

•  Compensating employees exposed to COVID-19  
pandemic by other employees in the workplace

Other ongoing health and safety measures that continued  
to be implemented, included:

•  Holding periodic Health & Safety (H&S) Committee 
meetings with dedicated representatives to address 
concerns, communicate and carry out measures to 
improve safety for workers

•  Ensuring provision of adequate Personal Protective 

Equipment (PPE) for workers

•  Assessing machinery, equipment and new products to 

ensure safety

•  Conducting training using multimedia tools to ensure 

workers are well versed in safety awareness and 
procedures including the handling of hazardous materials

•  Providing employees with First Aid, CPR and fire-fighting 

training where relevant

•  Continuing frequent internal inspections to ensure there 
were no H&S policy breaches and check that safety 
equipment such as eye washing stations and defibrillators 
function well

•  Conducting departmental, line and management  

H&S audits

•  Continuing risk assessment and inspections by third-party 
experts and implementing corrective and prevention 
measures for potential hazards

basis. In 2020, there were 136 recorded 
work-related injuries. There were 17 
high-consequence injuries recorded and 
3,804 lost days due to injury across our 
global operations. Work injuries typically 
faced by TTI employees include strains 
caused by manual handling of boxes, cuts, 
burns, blood and respiratory ailments from 
soldering and chemicals, ergonomic risks, 
potential injuries from electrical contact, fire, 
traffic accidents, lumbar discomfort due to 
long driving hours as well as musculoskeletal 
disorders and eyestrain associated with 
extended screen time. Details on specific 
injuries that occurred in 2020 can be 
found in our Performance Metrics. There 
was one work-related fatality reported in our 
operations this year due to a car accident.

Key  
Initiatives

Progress  
in 2020

In addition to health and safety, TTI 
continued to prioritize the wellbeing of 
employees and provide support to them  
and their families. A snapshot of initiatives 
across our markets, some of which were 
limited by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 
include:

•  Ensuring employees and their family 
members had access to our various 
specialized employee assistance 
programs such as Lifeworks in Australia 
and New Zealand, which provides free, 
confidential counseling 24 hours a day,  
7 days a week

•  Providing medical, life, personal accident 

and travel insurance, critical illness 
coverage and income protection plans,  
as appropriate in different markets

Across the Group in 2020, there were no 
incidents of non-compliance with health and 
safety regulations or voluntary codes as we 
continued to strive to improve our practices 
in line with business, operational and 
legislative requirements.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,  
we established a mental health first aid 
program in our Australia and New Zealand 
operations to ensure employees have access 
to emotional support within the workplace. 
By implementing one-to-one check-ins for 
employees and managers across our sales 
teams, this program created a structured 
approach for managers to engage with onsite 
employees to see how they are feeling both 
professionally and personally. Similarly,  
our HR department in the PRC offered  
a counseling service hotline to employees  
to help with managing mental health 
concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During the month of February in PRC, 
counsellors talked to 360 employees from  
all levels of the Company. Our ongoing 
face-to-face counseling service was also 
enhanced in 2020 to meet employee needs.

While managing our COVID-19 pandemic 
response, TTI’s business units also continued 
to address the risks to health and safety that

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | Social and CommunityProgress  
in 2020

In 2020, there were no reported incidents or 
of discrimination across TTI. The year was 
marked by an expansion of diversity 
campaigns and programs with significant 
strides made by our North American 
operations. As a direct result of a 2019 
employee survey conducted by our 
Milwaukee team, employees expressed  
a desire for more D&I initiatives within the 
company, and thus, a D&I Subcommittee 
was created. This subcommittee not only 
worked to re-define Milwaukee’s culture 
through our “One Team” framework, but  
also proceeded to establish an objective 
statement. This statement affirms the team’s 
“…commitment to creating, sustaining and 
celebrating a workplace and community that 
promotes respect and cultural humility, and 
values diversity and equality for all.” Top 
level support for this D&I initiative was 
established by Milwaukee’s President 
through a video presentation, accessible to 
all employees, about Milwaukee’s evolving 
cultural expectations.

Other business units, including TTIPE  
and TTIFC, also made progress with D&I 
initiatives in 2020. TTIPE developed  
a subcommittee for employees and another 
for leadership, communicating a plan of 
action to Division Presidents. This plan 
includes the launch of an employee survey 
and outlines next steps for 2021. Similarly, 
TTIFC formed a 15-member D&I Council 

which brought outside speakers to TTI as  
part of Lunch-n-Learn sessions and is working 
to prepare a D&I planning statement.

In 2021, TTI businesses across the globe will 
participate in quarterly D&I meetings and 
work to integrate D&I into our corporate 
culture through further training and education. 
TTI is also looking to partner with external 
experts to further promote inclusion 
programs across our value chain.

In addition to our newer initiatives on D&I, 
TTI continues to champion inclusion in  
our recruiting practices. In the Americas, 
Milwaukee accomplished this by establishing 
national partnerships with diverse networking 
groups such as the National Society of Black 
Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women 
Engineering (SWE) and the Society of 
Hispanic Engineering (SHPE). We also 
strengthened diversity in recruitment by 
dedicating a Milwaukee employee to spend 
time at university campuses to engage 
student organizations focused on promoting 
diversity and to establish diverse interview 
teams for candidate engagement.

In 2020, 27% of our employees in the  
role of assistant manager or above were 
women. More details on the diversity of  
our workforce can be found in the

Management 
Approach

We continue to ensure that our customers have access to safe, 
high-quality products that meet their needs and improve their 
lifestyles. Our Product Safety and Consumer Product Regulatory 
Compliance Policies outline all our safety measures. Managed 
by a committee of Product Safety Directors from different 
business units, our internal audit investigations and compliance 
monitoring procedures ensure that high standards are maintained 
across TTI and immediate corrective actions can be taken 
if required.

Customer satisfaction is our key objective. This applies to  
all products designed, manufactured, distributed or licensed 
by TTI. As a result, we actively monitor social media and 
online sales channels for customer comments. We consider 
and act on all customer feedback, in addition to recording 
and analyzing all service requests and complaints to use  
in improving product design. Furthermore, our product  
warranty policy ensures that customers have a satisfactory 
after-purchase experience.

TTI’s comprehensive quality assurance process encompasses 
quality control of incoming materials, in-process products and 
inspection and reliability testing of our outgoing products. Our 
legal teams along with our safety and regulatory departments 
oversee any product recalls if they should occur, ensuring 
compliance with regulations until their safe disposal. TTI’s 
product safety initiatives are focused on building continuous 
improvement into our processes to provide customers with 
the best possible user experience. Continual enhancement  
of quality, compliance and safety at individual business units 
is the responsibility of Product Safety Directors, committees 
and teams.

TTI meets or exceeds all applicable and voluntary  
industry standards globally. Relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements related to health and safety, advertising, 
labeling and privacy matters associated with our products 
that have the potential to significantly impact our operations 
and performance are listed in Appendix A of our HKEX ESG 
Guide Content Index on our website.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | Social and CommunityKey  
Initiatives

Examples of initiatives taken across business units to ensure 
product safety and customer satisfaction are as follows.

•  Providing repair and warranty services to customers at 

product service centers

•  Implementing design improvements based on end user 

feedback on product samples

•  Ensuring phone, web and retail level inquiries from 

customers are well managed and customer service lines 
for all tool brands are staffed seven days per week 

•  Providing technical training at product information centers 

for customers, including dealers and OEM partners 

•  Offering customers product safety training conducted by 

sales and Jobsite Solution teams 

•  Training Field Service and Customer Service 

Representatives on building customer relationships

•  Replacing gas engine products with MX FUEL line tools so 
they can be used safely in enclosed or confined spaces 
without the risk of carbon monoxide emissions

•  Expanding our line of PPE to keep people safe on job sites 

•  Developing a line of tool lanyards to prevent tools from 
falling on coworkers or others when used from heights

•  Expanding and providing improvements in lithium-ion 

battery technology in our tools to reduce the usage of cord 
connected and gasoline powered products

•  Ensuring global alignment and collaboration of our 

safety teams 

Progress  
in 2020

In 2020, there were no recalls of TTI products due to health 
and safety reasons and no violations of labeling and 
advertising regulations across markets. The COVID-19 
pandemic, while posing some grave challenges, led to the 
development of new product lines. We have long been 
producing PPE products, including masks, and continued to do 
so to meet the needs of workers at job sites.

In addition to new products, in 2020, we continued to 
develop cordless tools that are not only environmentally 
responsible, but also safer for end users. Cords pose a risk as 
they present a number of hazards such as the possibility of 
injury from tripping. Damaged and frayed cords can also 
potentially cause electrocution or injury at job sites and 
homes. Looking forward, our focus remains on continuous 
improvement to enhance safety for employees and 
customers alike.

Management 
Approach

Across our global operations, our businesses and colleagues 
are committed to improving the livelihoods and sustainability 
of local communities. To achieve our goals, we implement 
robust initiatives that continue to focus on:

•  Helping vulnerable people in need, including actions to 
fight poverty and modern slavery, build adequate shelter, 
and support veterans and healthcare needs

•  Improving protection of local environments

•  Providing disaster relief where needed

•  Promoting women’s rights and education

•  Inspiring younger generations to develop careers  

in technology

•  Supporting other important needs in local communities

Leveraging our resources and collaborating with local 
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to support these 
strategic areas, enables us to create a more substantive 
impact in the communities where we operate.

TTI business units across all our markets donate tools that 
are useful to the community, provide financial support to 
worthy causes and facilitate volunteering. Some business 

units have a formal mechanism to select community 
engagement projects for employees. Others commit to  
annual sponsorships of projects while considering new 
engagement opportunities as needs arise. Some provide 
employees with paid volunteer time, allowing employees 
to volunteer for the charity of their choice. Our ESG 
Working Committee regularly reviews our progress in 
supporting communities to ensure our initiatives both align 
with our strategic priorities and are effectively implemented  
to achieve overall goals.

In 2020, we continued our corporate partnership with Habitat 
for Humanity by focusing on homelessness and the global 
response to COVID-19 pandemic.

Many of our initiatives in 2020 focused on health, safety and 
hygiene projects or involved home-bound activities to meet 
the specific needs of communities faced with the COVID-19 
pandemic. In the face of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and 
adapting to virtual programs when needed, we continued  
to be active in the fight against modern slavery, the promotion 
of women’s rights and in supporting educational initiatives 
for youth.

Key  
Initiatives

Some of our key community engagement activities in 2020 
are highlighted below.

Helping People in Need
Poverty Relief
While always a focus of our community support, poverty 
relief initiatives were even more critical during 2020 with 
communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic globally.

Asia
Our Hong Kong team participated in the Skip Lunch Day 
Program, benefiting street sleepers and residents in caged 
homes and cubicles, organized by the Community Chest.  
As part of this initiative, staff were encouraged to donate the 
equivalent of their lunch cost to those in need and received  
a coupon to redeem a complimentary drink at a local eatery 
as a reward for their donation.

Home-building Projects
Our home-building projects continue to be a key focus  
of our community outreach. Home improvement projects 
around sanitation and hygiene were particularly important  
due to these needs being heightened in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

A global partnership with

Asia
In Asia, our ongoing projects with Habitat for Humanity 
support renovation programs and COVID-19 pandemic 
response projects, as well as house construction and 
sanitation activities. As part of these initiatives, we pledged 
power tools and cash worth US$250,000 for programs  
that provide safe and decent shelter for families in need.  
In Hong Kong, TTI supported Project Home Works, which 
provided basic home repairs and renovation work for 12 
low-income elderly families, single-parent families and 
physically-challenged people in 2020. We also supported  
a Deep Cleaning Program that provided home hygiene kits 
and deep cleaning services to 40 elderly families during the 
year. This also benefitted 20 low-income women by providing 
cleaning jobs.

Key  
Initiatives

Americas
To address hunger in the community, our Milwaukee office  
in Brookfield donated US$75,000 to the Hunger Task Force 
of Milwaukee and 50 employees from Olive Branch donated 
non-perishable food to a hunger relief NGO for its Food Drive 
Project. Milwaukee Brookfield also provided the United 
Way charity with tools worth US$17,960 for its 
community programs.

In Mexico, 35 colleagues participated in the Elderly Nursing 
Food Can Campaign. Employees were invited to donate 
canned and dry food, soup, personal hygiene items and adult 
diapers as part of a drive for those in need at a nursing home.

Our colleagues at TTIFC helped another important cause  
by making a cash donation, matched by TTI, to Classroom 
Central. This NGO helps students in need by providing free 
learning supplies to teachers. In addition, virtual events, food 
drives and monetary donations were made for other causes, 
ranging from youth in crisis and housing for low-income 
families, to parenting classes run by the NGO, The Relatives.

Eradicating Modern Slavery
Our responsible sourcing partnerships are critical not only  
for the sustainability of our business and supply chain,  
but to further social justice in vulnerable communities.  
We contributed US$50,000 to the Better Mining Cobalt Due 
Diligence and Impact Program run by the RCS Global Group, 
which funds the monitoring of cobalt and copper mines in 
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This monitoring 
program ultimately improves the sustainability practices of 
the mines, thereby enhancing the socio-economic 
conditions of the wider community.

A partnership with

TTI also contributed US$10,000 to the RMI Audit Fund 
which helps smelters and refiners that source from conflict-
affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs) conduct due diligence 
with capacity building or the help of a consultant. Enhancing 
the sustainability practices in CAHRAs contributes to the 
economic development of the surrounding local communities.

TTI has developed a relationship with the Mekong Club,  
a business association whose mission is to end modern slavery.

In Vietnam, we supported programs that helped three 
families in need to build new houses and eight others  
to renovate their homes in 2020. We also funded the 
installation of two hand washing facilities and a waste 
management system to serve 500 students and teachers  
at a primary school. This was an extremely well-received 
renovation project given the hygiene concerns posed by 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Americas
Our housing initiatives with Habitat for Humanity continued  
in North America with Milwaukee Brookfield contributing 
tools worth US$170,848 to projects. We also donated 
US$33,032 worth of tools to the Manatee County Habitat 
project. Apart from cash donations, 59 employees volunteered 
to help with various building tasks for a house in Waukesha 
County and six volunteers assisted with tasks such as stocking, 
sorting donations and assisting customers and full-time staff 
at Habitat ReStore locations. In addition, nine employees 
volunteered to help with building and finishing tasks for  
a house in Milwaukee County and 23 volunteers helped to 
build storage sheds to be transported to different Habitat  
for Humanity locations. Five employees contributed 175 
volunteer hours to Habitat for Humanity for a project in 
Anderson, South Carolina with TTI PE donating tools for 
the project.

Other than Habitat for Humanity, we also assisted 2x4 for 
Hope, a global NGO that provides shelter to those in need with 
a donation of tools worth US$63,868. Other housing NGO 
projects that were supported with tools or cash donations 
include: Acts Housing (US$11,621), The North Central 
Regional Council of Carpenters (US$9,293), ReNew for 
Communities (US$5,851), Revitalize Milwaukee (US$30,000) 
and Acts Community Development Corporation (US$30,000).

Support for Veterans
Supporting veterans has also been a longstanding commitment 
for TTI in North America. In 2020, we provided donations to 
various projects including the Center for Military Recruitment 
Veterans Employment (US$25,000), the Milwaukee Homeless 
Veterans Initiative (US$15,000) and the Veterans Outreach of 
Wisconsin (US$15,000).

Healthcare Initiatives
In Mexico, N95 facemasks were donated to those in need,  
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten employees from 
TTI Mexico participated in this operation. In addition, 
Milwaukee Brookfield and TTIPE both donated US$25,000 to 
the Morehouse School of Medicine. In Canada, our support 
took the form of fundraising activities. 15 employees 
participated in an indoor volleyball tournament to raise funds 
for Sick Kids Foundation, 30 employees participated in a 
running marathon benefiting the Canadian Red Cross, while 
17 employees joined the National Cycling Challenge to raise 
money for the Heart Stroke Foundation, with the donation 
being tripled by Manulife Financial. TTIFC supported children

We partnered with Habitat for Humanity to provide education, 
access and systems providing clean and safe water resources 
for community members living in remote areas of Vietnam. 
Through our partnership, new latrines and water tanks were 
built, as well as a water pipeline connecting families to 
communal water stations. As part of the WASH program, 
training workshops for families and school children were 
organized to teach the importance of water and sanitation 
hygiene for 72 families and 300 children.

As part of our environmental efforts, we also donated tools 
and equipment to the arboriculture program at the Open 
University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing School of Professional 
and Continuing Education. Our donation enabled an 
Arboriculture Workshop to be set up, providing hands-on 
training for tree management personnel.

In addition, and to promote sustainable product design 
initiatives, TTI partnered with the Low Carbon Design Society  
of Hong Kong (HKMMDA). As part of this engagement, TTI 
showcased examples of creative and structured approaches 
to corporate design strategy and management to encourage 
young scholars and entrepreneurs in the field.

Our contribution to the Better Mining Initiative and the RMI 
Audit Fund also had an environmental benefit as the programs 
run by these organizations improve the sustainability practices 
of mines, thereby improving the environmental management  
of these operations and thereby also benefitting the 
surrounding communities.

Disaster Relief Efforts
Americas
Our disaster relief initiatives centered on TTIFC’s support of the 
Cookeville-Putnam County Tornado Relief Fund for victims of  
a tornado. We donated US$10,000 for impacted community 
members as well as 100 RYOBI generators and two pallets of 
tools to help with rebuilding. A TTIFC Cookeville Employee 
Relief Fund was also set up on gofundme.com with funds 
going directly to employees who were affected by the tornado. 
Our Milwaukee Olive Branch operation also supported the 
Northcentral Electric Power Association by donating specific 
tools and accessories. As part of this effort, ten employees 
volunteered to assist areas struck by hurricanes to regain power.

Supporting Women and Girls

A partnership with

Asia
Our focus on programs for women continued with our 
partnership with the Asian University for Women (AUW).  
In 2020, TTI joined a mentorship program designed to 
provide upper-year students and alumni with the opportunity 
to enhance their academic experience and personal growth. 
AUW draws students from 18 countries in Asia and the 
Middle East, including from marginalized groups including 
Rohingya refugees, Bangladeshi textile factory workers, 
women from high-conflict zones including Afghanistan,  
Syria and Yemen, and women from tea plantations in India 
and Sri Lanka. By supporting this program, TTI is proud to 
champion the cause of women’s education and help drive 
AUW’s efforts to create international networks of women 
leaders and their supporters.

Americas
TTI Canada has continued its support of women in the 
skilled trades through Build a Dream, which spotlights 
career opportunities under skilled trades, STEM, emergency 
response, entrepreneurship and advancing women in 
society. Milwaukee Canada has contributed to Build a Dream  
at trade shows and virtual showcases through donations  
and is currently working with Build a Dream to develop  
a co-branded toolbox for women entering the trades.

Milwaukee Canada also supports Girls Can Too (GCT),  
a program focused on providing women with opportunities  
to learn about the environment and skilled trades in their 
communities and supporting hands-on training at job sites. 
Three female Milwaukee Canada representatives continue  
to be responsible for the program’s power tool safety 
demonstrations. Milwaukee Canada has donated or 
subsidized all the tools used in the program.

Nurturing the Next Generation
Our business units support a number of educational 
initiatives for youth across the globe.

Asia
In Hong Kong, TTI is involved with the Scholarship for  
Future Stars program organized by The Commission on 
Poverty (CoP) and the Hong Kong Council of Social Service 
(HKCSS). Through this initiative we offered scholarships 
valued at US$10,000 to youth from less-privileged 
backgrounds, helping them achieve upward social mobility 
through education. TTI provides design technology 
workshops for high school students from the English School 
Foundation’s, West Island School (WIS). In 2020, in place  
of the student experience week in Dongguan, China. TTI 
facilitated a three-day interactive virtual study program from 
China to Hong Kong, presenting design, manufacturing,  
and engineering topics to the BTEC Engineering students.  
This experience allowed students to see the manufacturing 
theory they learned in school, applied at a professional level 
on actual machines.

In Dubai, employees, customers and community 
members participated in an online challenge 
to promote inclusion. The event titled, 
#ClimbwithRio was created by a TTI employee 
named Nick Watson who carried his son Rio,  
a 17-year old with physical challenges, on his 
back for the event. As part of the challenge, 
Nick climbed the equivalent height of the Burj 
Khalifa, the world’s largest tower, on stairs at 
home. Thousands of people around the world 
joined in the challenge, safely from their homes 
due to stay at home directives in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten participants from 
TTI took part in their own way, on their own time 
and using their own landmarks for their goal 
height. People of all ages and abilities found a 
way to get involved, embracing inclusion and 
raising funds for the organization Team Angel 
Wolf. This has motivated the team to expand 
the program further.

Responsible Sourcing

Why it’s 
Important

The sourcing of raw materials and all other activities along 
our supply chain have lasting environmental, social and 
economic impacts. Sustainable sourcing practices allow us 
to manage supply chain risk, ensuring business continuity 
and trust in our Innovative Products and Powerful Brands.

Goals

We aim to maintain a sustainable sourcing strategy whereby 
our suppliers are in compliance with all ethical, social and 
environmental standards.

Impact along the Value Chain

 ` Substantive initiatives to train, raise awareness, 

improve human rights and environmental impact  
in the supply chain

 ` Work with our suppliers to collect environmental data 
and set reduction targets for GHG emissions, energy 
and water consumption and set targets

 ` Effective partnerships with NGOs in major countries 
of operations and where there is a greater risk of 
human rights violations within the supply chain

 ` Partner with our suppliers in managing waste and 

promote reuse and use of recycled materials to further 
circularity in our supply chain

 ` Zero incidents of non-compliance with TTI’s policies 

 ` Increase the traceability of key raw materials in our 

and codes with transparency in reporting and 
remediation when necessary, including incidents  
and reporting of child and forced labor

The nature of our global business means that TTI is dependent 
on an incredibly complex international supply chain. Given that 
we operate in a multi-polar economic system, risks such as 
trade tensions, extreme weather events, social and human 
rights violations and cyberattacks have long been factors we 
must consider. However, the occurrence of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020 brought unprecedented challenges to both 
the health of people in our supply chain and the movement of 
goods across borders. Recent events have reinforced TTI’s 
focus on enhancing sustainability practices across our value 
chain. Our responsible sourcing strategy is therefore built around 
preparing for future impacts and recognize that it is imperative 
we act now to ensure our business continuity.

Maintaining Accountability and High Standards
Responsible sourcing starts with transparency and  
a commitment to holding all our suppliers accountable  
to the same standards that we follow internally. Just as 
employees must adhere to a strict code of conduct and 
compliance policies, suppliers must acknowledge and 
comply with all TTI policies. Our main requirements for 
suppliers are outlined in our contractual and standard 
purchase order terms as well as our Business Partner  
Code of Conduct (BPCoC), which was re-launched in  
2020 to address revised trade sanction provisions.  
Our Code is also consistent with the Code of Conduct  
of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a multi-
stakeholder organization that we joined as a supporter 
member in 2020.

128

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020

Environmental, Social and Governance Report | Supply Chain ManagementManagement 
Approach

The selection of suppliers at TTI is a process that involves 
careful oversight by our trade compliance, finance, legal, 
general compliance, procurement and quality teams.  
This process takes into consideration several criteria such  
as quality and reliability as well as environmental, social and 
governance factors, in addition to cost. All our business 
partners are checked against sanction lists and other 
compliance criteria. We mandate that our suppliers comply 
with labor standards, including no forced or child labor, 
discrimination or prevention of freedom of association for 
workers. Our suppliers must also comply with minimum wage 
requirements as per applicable local laws. In addition, we 
request that our suppliers have environmental management 
system certifications or systems that are in accordance with 
the principles of ISO standards. Our suppliers must comply 
with local laws when it comes to environmental protection 
and handling of waste.

  Social & Environmental Responsibility (SER) 
Compliance Program (launched 2019)

TTI’s environmental and social responsibility standards and 
expectations are available to all our suppliers online and 
discussed in person when new suppliers are engaged.  
These requirements are also frequently reiterated, specifically 
during conferences and when suppliers are being assessed 
and audited. We consider our suppliers to be true partners 
and assist them in enhancing their sustainability practices, 
this helps TTI achieve our own sustainability goals.

Supplier Compliance
Suppliers are actively engaged in our Social & Environmental 
Responsibility (SER) Compliance Program. Suppliers can 
access training materials and acknowledge their acceptance 
of key compliance requirements and policies via our Online 
Compliance Platform. This platform also enables TTI to carry out  
a quick online review of supplier performance and any risks 
associated with particular suppliers. New suppliers are 
audited before they are engaged and assessed on a regular 
basis. More details on supplier engagement can be found in 
the section on Supplier Assessment and Auditing below.

TTI sees corruption and bribery in the supply chain as key risks, 
and misconduct is not tolerated. In addition to championing 
anti-corruption, our mandate extends to ensuring responsible 
social and environmental practices. We engage with suppliers  
to maintain accountability on pollution mitigation, resource, 
chemical and waste management and factory security as well  
as labor and human rights, and health, and safety conditions.

Human Rights Focus
We are continuously mapping the human rights risks in our 
supply chain and this has enabled us to prioritize and focus 
our strategy on countries and raw materials that pose the 
highest risk of human rights violations. Our Policy Against 
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking specifically addresses 
TTI’s expectations on upholding human rights standards and 
the consequences of non-compliance. All global suppliers are 
made aware of this policy and it is accessible across markets 
in local languages. This policy, the BPCoC and our policies 
on Conflict Minerals and Cobalt Procurement are available 
through our online platform and on our website  
(https://www.ttigroup.com/our-company/about-tti/our-policies).  
The communications around these materials ensure that  
our suppliers are clear on TTI’s position of no child or 
forced labor.

Management 
Approach

Steps to achieve supplier compliance on human rights 
standards and TTI’s related policies are outlined below.

Employee Acknowledgment  
and Training
Employees formally 
acknowledge and receive 
training on the Employee 
Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct and  
our Policy Against  
Modern Slavery and  
Human Trafficking

Supplier Acknowledgment 
and Training
Suppliers formally 
acknowledge the Business 
Partner Code of Conduct 
and the Policy Against 
Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking and are trained 
on the risk of modern 
slavery in the supply chain

Assessments Assessments of modern slavery  
and human trafficking risk conducted annually 

Regular Site Visits and Audits Regular site visits and 
audits of high-risk operations and suppliers conducted

Corrective Actions Corrective actions required for  
any identified non conformity, termination of the 
relationship, support of the victim and engagement of 
local organizations

Suppliers and business partners are encouraged to  
report violations of our Code or policies, or any social or 
environmental non-compliance or issue. They can utilize  
our third-party operated, compliance hotline to proactively 
voice concerns or areas for improving overall performance. 
TTI is diligent about conducting thorough investigations if  
we receive complaints. In 2020, there were no complaints 
reported by our suppliers.

Supplier Assessment and Auditing
An important part of our SER Compliance Program is its 
ongoing auditing function. Audits are conducted before 
engaging any new supplier to establish their ESG practices 
are in accordance with TTI’s policies, international standards 
and applicable local laws and regulations. Onboarding and 
ongoing compliance audits conducted by the SER Compliance, 
quality and sourcing teams or external auditors follow a detailed 
supplier scorecard. This scorecard is used to monitor wide-
ranging issues pertaining to responsible sourcing including:

•  Ethics, governance and anti-corruption

•  Social standards, human rights, labor laws, as well as health 

and safety

•  Environmental standards, hazardous substance 

management, compliance with ISO 14001 or other 
environmental management system requirements

•  Factory security

If a supplier’s previous audit resulted in an acceptable score, 
they are audited every 12 to 18 months, depending on the 
level of risk assessed. More frequent audits are required for 
suppliers that have corrective action plans (CAPs) that 
require completion. TTI monitors the implementation of CAPs 
on an ongoing basis and assists suppliers to demonstrate 
continuous improvement. Suppliers are then reassessed and 
terminated if major compliance issues are not corrected.

Conflict Minerals and Cobalt Procurement
TTI does not source directly from mineral sourcing companies, 
but our products, and in particular the electronics used in our 
products contain certain minerals. Our efforts to uphold human 
rights and responsible sourcing are reflected in TTI’s Conflict 
Minerals Policy and Cobalt Procurement Policy and in the risk 
assessments of our supply chain, due diligence on our suppliers, 
and in our industry collaboration. Our policies outline requirements 
that all mined tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold (3TG) and cobalt 
used in our products must be from conflict-free, reputable 
sources, or from sources currently working with international 
bodies like the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) to become 
certified as conflict-free. First initiated in 2015, our conflict 
minerals program continues to evolve. In 2019, we added 
oversight of cobalt and we are now considering other 
materials to meet the same stringent requirements.

Suppliers must acknowledge and implement these policies and 
provide details about their sources in prescribed declaration 
forms, specifically the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template and 
the Cobalt Reporting Template, which are completed annually. 
We also continue to work with a US-based, third party to collect 
and validate data from our suppliers and conduct analysis of 
compliance data and risk assessments when it comes to conflict 
minerals and cobalt procurement. In addition, we have been  
a member of the RMI since 2019 and became a supporter 
member of the RBA in 2020. RMI and RBA provide us with 
tools and the opportunity to exchange information as well as 
forge partnerships with other like-minded members as we work 
to strengthen responsible procurement in the global supply 
chain. Through RMI, TTI has access to Reasonable Country of 
Origin (RCOI) data validated through the Responsible 
Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), an online smelter 
database and a country risk assessment platform to identify 
high-risk areas. These resources have enabled TTI to make 
increasingly responsible sourcing decisions and enhance the 
transparency of our procurement. More details about our 
memberships can be found in the Building Partnerships 
section below.

Approach

Building Partnerships
In 2020, we continued the mapping of human rights risk in 
our supply chain as part of our membership commitment to 
the RBA. RBA is a coalition of leading companies working to 
improve efficiency and social, ethical and environmental 

responsibility in the global supply chain. TTI fully supports the 
vision and the mission of the RBA, which drive sustainable 
value for workers, the environment and business through  
the collaborative efforts of members, suppliers and other 
stakeholders in alignment with leading standards and practices.

Key  
Initiatives

In addition to our ongoing actions to implement our SER 
Compliance Program, the key initiatives we undertook in 2020 
to enhance how we address ESG risks in the supply chain are 
highlighted below.

•  Putting in place a system of desktop audits for  

suppliers that could not be audited onsite due to  
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions
•  Increasing the number of audits
•  Training additional auditors to conduct SER compliance  

as part of our annual audits

We are aiming at partnering with our key suppliers in the 
value chain to reduce GHG emissions, water usage and 
waste. In the future we aim to monitor the following key 
indicators to enhance sustainable practices in our 
supply chain:

•  Amount of energy consumed

•  Amount of GHG emissions

•  Amount of water consumed

•  Amount of waste to landfill

•  Continuing onsite audits as normal within markets  

•  Amount of waste recycled

like PRC, Taiwan and Vietnam, where there were no  
travel restrictions 

•  Conflict Minerals and Cobalt Procurement Campaign
•  Launch our revised BPOC

•  Renewable energy projects

Progress  
in 2020

There were no high risk concerns identified in our Conflict 
Minerals and Cobalt Procurement Campaigns. Of the 
smelters identified in the Conflict Minerals Campaign, 15% 
indicated sourcing from the DRC and 96% were conflict-free 
certified. This brought the total amount of low-risk smelters  
to 98%, when considering those engaged in the Responsible 
Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), RMI’s assessment 
which validates smelters’ management processes for 
responsible mineral procurement. Our Cobalt Procurement 
Campaign was run separately, and of the smelters identified, 
86% were either certified or were engaged in RMAP.

Better Mining
Since December 2020, TTI has also supported the RCS Global 
Group by donating to and participating in the implementation 
of the Better Mining initiative. Better Mining is a mineral 
agnostic assurance and impact program that continuously 
improves conditions on and around Artisanal and Small-scale 

Mining (ASM) sites. Advocacy organizations and media reports 
have identified ASM in the DRC as one of the key sources 
for potential human rights and other responsible sourcing 
risks in the cobalt supply chain. As per our Cobalt 
Procurement Policy, we are taking action to tackle this risk.

Through Better Mining, TTI receives in-depth due diligence 
data on risks at ASM sites. Measures implemented at ASM sites 
include training on security and human rights, as well as 
sensitization campaigns around child labor, corruption, theft 
and gender-based violence. These continuous improvement 
practices on ASM sites illustrate the benefits of our engagement 
with Better Mining. Considering that approximately two million 
people in the DRC count on ASM for their livelihoods, we 
believe that supporting Better Mining and the improvement of 
ASM conditions is paramount. TTI has taken on this action in 
accordance with the principles of the RBA and to fulfill our 
commitment to support communities.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Report of the DirectorsTO THE MEMBERS OF TECHTRONIC INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED
創科實業有限公司
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries  
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) set out on pages 159 to 246, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as  
at December 31, 2020, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at  
December 31, 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have 
been properly prepared in compliance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“the Code”), and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

155

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Independent Auditor’s ReportKey Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter

How our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter

Capitalization of Deferred Development Costs

We identified the capitalization of costs as internally-generated 
intangible assets as a key audit matter which requires estimations 
and assumptions about the expected future economic benefits to 
be generated by the products resulting from these development 
activities. The Group conducts a significant level of development 
activities and has to apply judgement in identifying those projects 
meeting the criteria for capitalization under the requirements of  
the accounting standards, and the expected life of the products.

As disclosed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements,  
as at December 31, 2020 the carrying value of deferred development 
costs was US$394 million with the additions and amortization charge  
during the year being US$146 million and US$102 million respectively.

Recognition of income and deferred tax

We identified the recognition of income and deferred tax as a key 
audit matter as the Group operates in a complex multinational tax 
environment, in which the tax amounts, including provisions  
for potential tax exposures, and the realizability of the deferred tax 
assets, which depends on whether sufficient taxable profits or taxable 
temporary differences will be available in the future, are associated 
with a high degree of estimates and judgement.

As disclosed in Note 10 and Note 41 to the consolidated financial 
statements, as at December 31, 2020, the Group has recognized 
US$60 million of income tax expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and US$75 million 
deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of financial position, 
respectively.

Our procedures in relation to capitalization of deferred development 
costs included:

• 

• 

• 

• 

Obtaining an understanding of management’s process 
and relevant controls over the capitalization of deferred 
development costs;

Evaluating the nature of development expenses incurred that 
are capitalized into intangible assets;

Assessing the reasonableness of the capitalization based on 
our knowledge of the Group’s business strategy, historical track 
record and sales forecasts prepared by management; and

Evaluating the appropriateness of expenses capitalized, on 
a sample basis, by agreeing the cost incurred to external 
invoices and internal records.

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment about the 
recognition of income and deferred tax included:

• 

Obtaining an understanding of management’s process and 
relevant controls regarding the tax exposures and estimating 
the provision for income tax and deferred tax assets to be 
recognized;

•  Understanding and evaluating management’s estimates and 
judgements by considering the status of current tax authority 
inquiries, judgmental positions taken in the tax returns, the 
outcome of previous inquiries and current estimates and 
developments in the tax environment;

•  Using our tax specialists to evaluate and challenge the 

adequacy of management’s key assumptions and read the 
latest correspondence with the tax authorities to assess 
management’s estimates; and

• 

Evaluating management’s assessment of the sufficiency of 
future taxable profits supporting the recognition of deferred  
tax assets.

156

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Independent Auditor’s ReportOther Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance 
with section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability 
to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
the directors.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

157

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Independent Auditor’s ReportAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in the independent auditor’s report is Mr. Stephen David Smart.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsFor the year ended December 31, 20201.  General Information

Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in Hong Kong and its shares are listed 
on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). The address of the registered office and principal place of business 
of the Company is 29/F, Tower 2, Kowloon Commerce Centre, 51 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung, New Territories, Hong Kong.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are the manufacturing and trading of electrical and electronic 
products.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (“US$”), which is also the functional currency of the 
Company.

2.  Application of Amendments to Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”)

Amendments to HKFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied the Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in HKFRS Standards and the 
following amendments to HKFRSs issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) for the first time, which 
are mandatorily effective for the annual period beginning on or after January 1, 2020 for the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements:

Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKAS 8 
Amendments to HKFRS 3 
Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7 

Definition of Material
Definition of a Business
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

Except as described below, the application of the Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in HKFRS Standards and the 
amendments to HKFRSs in the current year had no material impact on the Group’s financial position and performance for the current and 
prior years and/or on the disclosures set out in these consolidated financial statements.

Impact on application of Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKAS 8 Definition of Material
The Group has applied the Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKAS 8 for the first time in the current year. The amendments provide a new 
definition of material that states “information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide 
financial information about a specific reporting entity.” The amendments also clarify that materiality depends on the nature or magnitude 
of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole.

The application of the amendments in the current year had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Impacts on application of Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
The Group has applied the amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments modify specific hedge accounting 
requirements to allow hedge accounting to continue for affected hedges during the period of uncertainty before the hedged items or 
hedging instruments affected by the current interest rate benchmarks are amended as a result of the on-going interest rate benchmark 
reform. The amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its benchmark interest rate exposures.

The amendments also introduce new disclosure requirements to IFRS 7 for hedging relationships that are subject to the exceptions 
introduced by the amendments to IFRS 9.

The Group has floating rate debt, linked to London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which it cash flow hedges using cross-currency 
interest rate swaps. The amendments permit continuation of hedge accounting even though there is uncertainty about the timing and 
amount of the hedged cash flows due to the interest rate benchmark reforms.

The Group retained the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve for designated cash flow hedges that are subject to interest 
rate benchmark reforms even though there is uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform with respect to the timing and 
amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur 
due to reasons other than interest rate benchmark reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

The application of the amendments has no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Except for the amendments to HKFRSs mentioned below, the directors of the Company anticipate that the application of all other new and 
amendments to HKFRSs will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future.

Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16 Interest Rate 
Benchmark Reform – Phase 2
Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39, HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 relate to 
the modification of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, specific hedge accounting requirements and disclosure 
requirements applying HKFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures to accompany the amendments regarding modifications and hedge 
accounting.

• 

• 

• 

Modification of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities. A practical expedient is introduced for modifications 
required by the reform (modifications required as a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform and made on an 
economically equivalent basis). These modifications are accounted for by updating the effective interest rate. All other modifications 
are accounted for using the current HKFRSs requirements. A similar practical expedient is proposed for lessee accounting applying 
HKFRS 16;

Hedge accounting requirements. Under the amendments, hedge accounting is not discontinued solely because of the interest 
rate benchmark reform. Hedging relationships (and related documentation) are required to be amended to reflect modifications to 
the hedged item, hedging instrument and hedged risk. Amended hedging relationships should meet all qualifying criteria to apply 
hedge accounting, including effectiveness requirements; and

Disclosures. The amendments require disclosures in order to allow users to understand the nature and extent of risks arising from 
the interest rate benchmark reform to which the Group is exposed to and how the entity manages those risks as well as the entity’s 
progress in transitioning from interbank offered rates to alternative benchmark rates, and how the entity is managing this transition.

As at December 31, 2020, the Group had several LIBOR bank loans which will be subject to the interest rate benchmark reform. The 
Group expects no significant gains or losses should the interest rate benchmark for these loans change and the Group is in the process of 
assessing the impact of the application which may have a potential impact on the hedge accounting and related disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group resulting from the reform on application of the amendments.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 2020 
 
2.  Application of Amendments to Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)
Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and related 
amendments to Hong Kong Interpretation 5 (2020)
The amendments provide clarification and additional guidance on the assessment of right to defer settlement for at least twelve months 
from reporting date for classification of liabilities as current or non-current, which:

• 

specify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the 
reporting period. Specifically, the amendments clarify that:

(i) 

the classification should not be affected by management intentions or expectations to settle the liability within 12 months; and

(ii) 

if the right is conditional on the compliance with covenants, the right exists if the conditions are met at the end of the 
reporting period, even if the lender does not test compliance until a later date.

• 

clarify that if a liability has terms that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the transfer of the entity’s 
own equity instruments, these terms do not affect its classification as current or non-current only if the entity recognizes the option 
separately as an equity instrument applying HKAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.

In addition, Hong Kong Interpretation 5 was revised as a consequence of the Amendments to HKAS 1 to align the corresponding wordings 
with no change in conclusion.

Based on the Group’s outstanding liabilities as at December 31, 2020, the application of the amendments will not result in a 
reclassification of the Group’s liabilities.

3.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. For the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, information is considered material if such information is reasonably expected to 
influence decisions made by primary users. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by 
the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange (the “Listing Rules”) and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance 
(“CO”).

The directors of the Company have, at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are 
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if 
market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value 
for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-
based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are accounted for 
in accordance with HKFRS 16 Leases and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net 
realizable value in HKAS 2 Inventories or value in use in HKAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

167

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20203.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:

• 

• 

• 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

• 

• 

• 

has the power over the investee;

is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each item of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity therein, which represent present ownership 
interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets of the relevant subsidiaries upon liquidation.

Business Combinations or Asset Acquisitions
Optional concentration test
Effective from January 1, 2020, the Group can elect to apply an optional concentration test, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, that 
permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The concentration test is met if 
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable 
assets. The gross assets under assessment exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects 
of deferred tax liabilities. If the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further 
assessment is needed.

Asset acquisitions
When the Group acquires a group of assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business, the Group identifies and recognizes the 
individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by allocating the purchase price first to financial assets/financial liabilities at 
the respective fair values, the remaining balance of the purchase price is then allocated to the other identifiable assets and liabilities on 
the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase. Such a transaction does not give rise to goodwill or bargain purchase gain.

Business Combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities 
incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Except for certain recognition exemptions, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of an asset 
and a liability in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (replaced by the Conceptual Framework for 
Financial Reporting issued in October 2010).

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value, except that:

• 

• 

• 

• 

deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in 
accordance with HKAS 12 Income Taxes and HKAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements 
of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with HKFRS 
2 at the acquisition date (see the accounting policy below);

assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard; and

lease liabilities are recognized and measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments (as defined in HKFRS 16) as if 
the acquired leases were new leases at the acquisition date, except for leases for which (a) the lease term ends within 12 months of 
the acquisition date; or (b) the underlying asset is of low value. Right of use assets (“ROU assets”) are recognized and measured at 
the same amount as the relevant lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared 
with market terms.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after re-assessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Basis of Consolidation (continued)
Business Combinations or Asset Acquisitions (continued)
Business Combinations (continued)
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the relevant subsidiary’s 
net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share 
of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets or at fair value. The choice of measurement basis is made on a 
transaction-by-transaction basis.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and considered as part of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted 
retrospectively. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the “measurement 
period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how 
the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is 
remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business (see the 
accounting policy above) less any accumulated impairment losses, if any.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating 
units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes and not larger than an operating segment.

A cash-generating unit (or groups of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently when there is indication that the unit may be impaired. For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a reporting period, the cash-
generating unit (or groups of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment before the end of that 
reporting period.

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (or groups of cash-generating units). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized 
directly in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit or any of the cash-generating unit within the group of cash-generating units, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the amount of profit or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of 
an operation within the cash-generating unit (or a cash-generating unit within a group of cash-generating units), the amount of goodwill 
disposed of is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation (or the cash-generating unit) disposed of and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit (or the group of cash-generating units) retained.

The Group’s policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is disclosed below.

Business Combinations or Asset Acquisitions (continued)
Interests in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates. Changes 
in net assets of the associate other than profit or loss and other comprehensive income are not accounted for unless such changes 
resulted in changes in ownership interest held by the Group. When the Group’s share of loss of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the 
Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of that associate.

An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee becomes an associate. On 
acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after 
reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

The Group assesses whether there is an objective evidence that the interest in an associate may be impaired. When any objective 
evidence exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with HKAS 
36 as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying 
amount. Any impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any assets, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the 
investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in accordance with HKAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of 
the investment subsequently increases.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in the 
investee with a resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate and the 
retained interest is a financial asset within the scope of HKFRS 9, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and 
the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the 
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of the relevant interest in the 
associates is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or 
loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) upon disposal/partial disposal of the relevant associate.

When the Group reduces its ownership interest in associates but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies 
to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group (such as a sale or contribution of assets), profits and losses resulting from 
the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associate that are not related to the Group.

Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets Acquired Separately
Intangible assets acquired separately and with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried 
at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially measured at their fair value 
at the acquisition date. The cost of these intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated 
impairment losses.

Internally-Generated Intangible Assets – Research and Development Expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development activities (or from the development phase of an internal project) is 
recognized only if all of the following have been demonstrated:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and

the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The amount initially recognized for an internally-generated intangible asset is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when 
the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognized, 
development expenditure is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, an internally-generated intangible asset is reported at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses (if any), on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognized.

Leases
Definition of a Lease
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.

For contracts entered into or modified on or after the date of initial application or arising from business combinations, the Group assesses 
whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under HKFRS 16 at inception, modification date or acquisition date, as 
appropriate. Such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.

As a practical expedient, leases with similar characteristics are accounted on a portfolio basis when the Group reasonably expects that the 
effects on the consolidated financial statements would not differ materially from individual leases within the portfolio.

The Group as a Lessee
Allocation of Consideration to Components of a Contract
For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the 
aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

Non-lease components are separated from lease component and are accounted for by applying other applicable standards.

Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases of premises, plant and machinery and motor vehicles as disclosed 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the 
recognition exemption for lease of low-value assets. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as 
expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the lease term.

ROU Assets
The cost of ROU assets includes:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;

any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and

an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is 
located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

ROU assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities.

ROU assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term are 
depreciated from commencement date to the end of the useful life. Otherwise, ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

The Group presents ROU assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Leases (continued)
The Group as a Lessee (continued)
Refundable Rental Deposits
Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at initial 
recognition are considered as additional lease payments and included in the cost of ROU assets.

Lease Liabilities
At the commencement date of a lease, the Group recognizes and measures the lease liability at the present value of lease payments that 
are unpaid at that date. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

The lease payments include:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;

variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and

payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

After the commencement date, lease liabilities are adjusted by interest accretion and lease payments.

The Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Lease Modifications
The Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if:

• 

• 

the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and

the consideration for the leases increases by an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the increase in scope and any 
appropriate adjustments to that standalone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.

For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group remeasures the lease liability based on the lease term of 
the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

The Group accounts for the remeasurement of lease liabilities by making corresponding adjustments to the relevant ROU asset. When 
the modified contract contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the modified contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and 
the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

Property, Plant & Equipment (“PP&E”)
PP&E including buildings are tangible assets that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative 
purposes, other than construction in progress. PP&E are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Freehold land is not depreciated and are measured at cost less subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognized so as to write-off the cost of items of PP&E, other than freehold land and construction in progress, over their 
estimated useful lives and after taking into account of their estimated residual values, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful 
lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.

174

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20203.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Property, Plant & Equipment (“PP&E”) (continued)
PP&E in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purpose is carried at cost, less any recognized impairment 
loss. Cost includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy. Construction in progress is classified to the appropriate category of PP&E when completed and ready for its intended 
use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other PP&E, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

When the Group makes payments for ownership interests of properties which includes both leasehold land and building elements, the 
entire consideration is allocated between the leasehold land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values at initial 
recognition. To the extent the allocation of the relevant payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold is presented as “ROU assets” 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. When the consideration cannot be allocated reliably between non-lease building 
element and undivided interest in the underlying leasehold land, the entire properties are classified as PP&E.

An item of PP&E is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the item) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognized.

Impairment PP&E, ROU Assets and Intangible Assets other than Goodwill
At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets with finite 
useful lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable 
amount of PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets are estimated individually. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
individually, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

In testing a cash-generating unit for impairment, corporate assets are allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit when a reasonable 
and consistent basis of allocation can be established, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for 
which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be established. The recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit 
or group of cash-generating units to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of the relevant cash-
generating unit or group of cash-generating units.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that they may 
be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset (or a cash-generating unit) for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. For corporate assets or portion of corporate assets which 
cannot be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to a cash-generating unit, the Group compares the carrying amount of a 
group of cash-generating units, including the carrying amounts of the corporate assets or portion of corporate assets allocated to that 
group of cash-generating units, with the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units. In allocating the impairment loss, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if applicable) and then to the other assets on a pro-rata 
basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit or the group of cash-generating units. The carrying amount of an asset is not 
reduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable), its value in use (if determinable) and zero. The amount of 
the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro-rata to the other assets of the unit or the group 
of cash-generating units. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating 
units) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit or a 
group of cash-generating units) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when a group entity becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and 
derecognized on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables arising from contracts with 
customers which are initially measured in accordance with HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL 
are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest 
income and interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Financial Assets
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized cost:

• 

• 

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and

the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“FVTOCI”):

• 

• 

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both selling and collecting contractual cash flows; 
and

the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship and, 
that at the date of initial application/initial recognition of a financial asset the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes 
in fair value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income if that equity investment is neither held for trading nor contingent 
consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which HKFRS 3 applies.

A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:

• 

• 

• 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or

on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument

Financial Assets (continued)
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets (continued)
Amortized Cost and Interest Income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for financial assets measured subsequently at amortized cost. Interest 
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets 
that have subsequently become credit-impaired (see below). For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest 
income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period. If 
the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income 
is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the beginning of the reporting 
period following the determination that the asset is no longer credit-impaired.

Financial Assets at FVTPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI or designated as FVTOCI are measured at 
FVTPL except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in 
profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial assets.

Impairment of Financial Assets and Other Item
The Group performs impairment assessment under expected credit loss (“ECL”) model on financial assets (including trade and other 
receivables, bills receivable, trade receivables from associates, bank balances, deposits and cash) and other items (financial guarantee 
contracts) which are subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect 
changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of the relevant instrument. In 
contrast, 12-month ECL (“12m ECL”) represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date. Assessments are done based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 
factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current conditions at the reporting 
date as well as the forecast of future conditions.

The Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables.

For all other instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to 12m ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, in which case the Group recognizes lifetime ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be 
recognized is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.

(i) 

Significant Increase in Credit Risk
In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at 
the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is 
reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or 
effort.

Significant Increase in Credit Risk (continued)
(i) 
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit 
default swap prices for the debtor;

existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant 
decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that 
results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable 
information that demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition if the debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined 
to have low credit risk if (i) it has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not 
necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a debt instrument to 
have low credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment grade” as per globally understood definitions.

For financial guarantee contracts, the date that the Group becomes a party to the irrevocable commitment is considered to be the 
date of initial recognition for the purposes of assessing impairment. In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts, the Group considers the changes in the risk that the specified 
debtor will default on the contract.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the 
amount becomes past due.

(ii)  Definition of Default

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default occurs when information developed internally or 
obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking 
into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due 
unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more 
appropriate.

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)

Impairment of Financial Assets and Other Item (continued)
(iii)  Credit-impaired Financial Assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events of default that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the 
following events:

(a) 

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;

(b) 

a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

(c) 

the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted 
to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; or

(d) 

it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.

(iv)  Write-off Policy

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and 
there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example, when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered 
into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery 
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Any subsequent 
recoveries are recognized in profit or loss.

(v)  Measurement and Recognition of ECL

The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a 
default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data 
and forward-looking information. Estimation of ECL reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined with 
the respective risks of default occurring as the weights. The Group uses a practical expedient in estimating ECL on trade receivables 
using a provision matrix taking into consideration historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking information that is 
available without undue cost or effort.

Generally, the ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract 
and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.

For a financial guarantee contract, the Group is required to make payments only in the event of a default by the debtor in 
accordance with the terms of the instrument that is guaranteed. Accordingly, the ECL is the present value of the expected payments 
to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs less any amounts that the Group expects to receive from the holder, the debtor 
or any other party.

For ECL on financial guarantee contracts for which the effective interest rate cannot be determined, the Group will apply a discount 
rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows but only 
if, and to the extent that, the risks are taken into account by adjusting the discount rate instead of adjusting the cash shortfalls being 
discounted.

Lifetime ECL for trade receivables are considered on a collective basis taking into consideration past due information and relevant 
credit information such as forward-looking macroeconomic information.

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)

Impairment of Financial Assets and Other Item (continued)
(v)  Measurement and Recognition of ECL (continued)

For collective assessment, the Group takes into consideration the following characteristics when formulating the grouping:

• 

• 

• 

Past-due status;

Nature, size and industry of debtors; and

External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit risk 
characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset unless the financial asset is credit-impaired, 
in which case interest income is calculated based on amortized cost of the financial asset (i.e. gross carrying amount less loss 
allowance for ECL).

Except for financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial 
instruments by adjusting their carrying amount, with the exception of trade receivables where the corresponding adjustment is 
recognized through a loss allowance account.

Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity Instrument
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Buy-back of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost
Financial liabilities (including unsecured borrowings, trade and other payables, bills payable and discounted bills with recourse) are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business 
combination to which HKFRS 3 applies, (ii) held for trading or (iii) it is designated as at FVTPL.

A financial liability is held for trading if:

• 

• 

• 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or

on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Liabilities and Equity (continued)
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL (continued)
For financial liabilities that are designated as at FVTPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to 
changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in 
the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair 
value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognised in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to 
profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained profits upon derecognition of the financial liability.

Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date when a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments for cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

For the purpose of determining whether a forecast transaction (or a component thereof) is highly probable, the Group assumes that the 
interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, is not altered as a result 
of interest rate benchmark reform.

Assessment of Hedging Relationship and Effectiveness
For hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group considers whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in cash flows 
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness 
requirements:

• 

• 

• 

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and

the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually 
hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective 
for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances 
the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

In assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the Group assumes that the interest rate 
benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest 
rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.

Financial Liabilities and Equity (continued)
Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from 
inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

For the purpose of reclassifying the amount of gains and losses accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in order to determine whether 
the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the Group assumes the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows 
(contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (hedging reserve) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as the recognized hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the 
cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

Discontinuation of Hedge Accounting
The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the 
qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised. Discontinuing hedge accounting can either affect a hedging relationship in its entirety or only a part of it (in which case hedge 
accounting continues for the remainder of the hedging relationship).

For cash flow hedge, any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognized when the forecast transactions is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Guarantee Contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group measures the financial guarantee 
contract at the higher of: (i) the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance with HKFRS 9; and (ii) the amount initially 
recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized over the guarantee period.

Derecognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognizes its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized 
borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the 
consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss.

The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The 
difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in 
profit or loss.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Financial Instruments (continued)
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are 
measured at the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into 
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the 
present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

Provisions for the expected cost of assurance-type warranty obligations under the relevant contracts with customers for sales of goods 
are recognized at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s 
obligation.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of inventories are determined on a using the first-in, first-
out method. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs 
necessary to make the sales.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when “control” of the goods or services underlying 
the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or 
services that are substantially the same.

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognized over time by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the 
relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met:

• 

• 

• 

the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs;

the Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or

the Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the distinct good or service.

Over time Revenue Recognition (Commission and Royalty Income): Measurement of Progress towards Complete 
Satisfaction of a Performance Obligation
The progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured based on output method, which is to recognize 
revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer to date relative to the 
remaining goods or services promised under the contract, that best depict the Group’s performance in transferring control of goods or 
services.

As a practical expedient, if the Group has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Group’s 
performance completed to date (i.e. royalty income), the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Group has the right to 
invoice.

Refund Liabilities
The Group recognizes a refund liability if the Group expects to refund some or all of the consideration received from customers.

183

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20203.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Sale with a Right of Return/Exchange
For a sale of products with a right of return/exchange for dissimilar products, the Group recognizes all of the following:

(a) 

revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled (therefore, revenue 
would not be recognized for the products expected to be returned/exchanged);

(b) 

a refund liability; and

(c) 

an asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for its right to recover products from customers and are presented as right 
to returned goods asset.

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests 
are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the 
temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or 
the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognizes the ROU assets and the related lease 
liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax deductions are attributable to the ROU assets or the lease liabilities.

For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group applies HKAS 12 Income Taxes 
requirements to the leasing transaction as a whole. Temporary differences relating to ROU assets and lease liabilities are assessed on 
a net basis. Excess of depreciation on ROU assets over the lease payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities resulting in net 
deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied to the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20203.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Taxation (continued)
Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in 
the accounting for the business combination.

In assessing any uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Group considers whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will 
accept the uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by individual group entities in their income tax filings. If it is probable, 
the current and deferred taxes are determined consistently with the tax treatment in the income tax filings. If it is not probable that the 
relevant taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of each uncertainty is reflected by using either the most likely 
amount or the expected value.

Foreign Currencies
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that 
entity (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting 
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates at that date. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognized in profit or 
loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on a monetary items receivable from or payable to foreign 
operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in a foreign operation), in 
which case, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity and will be reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period, and 
their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of translation reserve (attributed to non-controlling interests 
as appropriate).

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that 
includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners 
of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the 
proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognized in profit 
or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates that do not result in the Group losing significant influence), the 
proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after January 
1, 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the 
reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on acquisitions of foreign operations before January 1, 2005 
are treated as non-monetary foreign currency items of the acquirer and reported using the historical exchange rate prevailing at the date 
of the acquisition.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date.

The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments determined at the grant date without taking into consideration all non-market 
vesting conditions is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve). At the end of each 
reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest based on assessment of all relevant 
non-market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

At the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognized in employee share-based compensation reserve 
would be transferred to share capital. When the share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the amount 
previously recognized in the employee share-based compensation reserve would be transferred to retained profits.

When the trustee purchases the Company’s shares from the open market, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is presented as shares held for share award scheme and deducted from total equity. No gain or loss is recognized on 
the transactions of the Company’s own shares.

When the trustee transfers the Company’s shares to grantees upon vesting, the related costs of the granted shares vested are reversed 
from shares held under the share award scheme. Accordingly, the related expense of the granted shares vested is reversed from the 
employee share-based compensation reserve. The difference arising from this transfer is debited/credited to retained profits. At the end of 
the reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that are expected to ultimately vest. The impact of the revision 
of the estimate, if any, is recognized in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

Government Grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them 
and that the grants will be received. Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the 
Group recognized as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Government grants related to income that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of 
giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they 
become receivable. Government grants relating to compensation of expenses are deducted from the related expenses, other government 
grants are presented under “other income”.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Retirement Benefit Schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme are charged as expenses when 
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

For defined benefit retirement benefits plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in 
the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in reserves and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss.

Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment or curtailment and a gain or loss on settlement is 
recognized when settlement occurs. When determining past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, an entity shall remeasure the net 
defined benefit liability or asset using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions, reflecting the benefits offered 
under the plan and the plan assets before and after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, without considering the effect of asset 
ceiling (i.e. the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan).

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. However, 
if the Group remeasures the net defined benefit liability or asset before plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, the Group determines 
net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using the benefits 
offered under the plan and the plan assets after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and the discount rate used to remeasure 
such net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period 
resulting from contributions or benefit payments.

Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows:

• 

• 

• 

service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

net interest expense or income; and

remeasurement.

The retirement benefit obligations recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Short-term and other Long-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid as and when employees 
rendered the services. All short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense unless another HKFRS requires or permits the 
inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset.

A liability is recognized for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave) after deducting any 
amount already paid.

Liabilities recognized in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Any changes in the 
liabilities’ carrying amounts resulting from service costs, interests and remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent 
that another HKFRS requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20204.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors are required to make estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the estimates are revised if the revisions affect only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the 
revisions affect both current and future periods.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Estimated Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired requires an estimation of their recoverable 
amounts, which is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Where the 
actual future cash flows are less than expected, or change in facts and circumstances which results in downward revision of future cash 
flows or upward version of discount rate, a material impairment loss or further impairment loss may arise. As at December 31, 2020, the 
carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are approximately US$578,461,000 (2019: US$580,866,000) 
and approximately US$224,440,000 (2019: US$227,640,000) respectively. Details of the recoverable amount calculation are disclosed in 
Note 20. Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored 
and adjustments will be made in future periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Capitalization, Useful Lives and Estimated Impairment of Deferred Development Costs
Determining the development costs, including the time and costs for individual projects, to be capitalized requires estimations and 
assumptions based on the expected future economic benefits to be generated by the products resulting from these development costs. 
Other important estimations and assumptions in this assessment process are the feasibility of mass production, the distinction between 
research and development and the estimated useful life. As at December 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of deferred development costs 
of the Group are US$394,144,000 (2019: US$388,018,000). The estimation of their useful lives impacts the level of annual amortization 
recorded. The estimation of their useful lives reflects the directors’ best estimate of the periods that future economic benefits will be 
received through the use of the assets. In determining whether the deferred development costs are impaired, the management takes into 
consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the underlying projects, and the progress of these projects. 
When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise and need to be recognized. 
Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and 
adjustments will be made in future periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Income Taxes
As at December 31, 2020, deferred tax assets of US$25,362,000 (2019: US$28,165,000) in relation to unused tax losses and 
US$39,452,000 (2019: US$31,984,000) in relation to employee related provisions has been recognized in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position. The realizability of the deferred tax assets mainly depends on whether sufficient taxable profits, or taxable 
temporary differences, will be available in the future. In cases where the actual future taxable profits generated are less than expected, or 
change in facts and circumstances which result in revision of future taxable profits estimation, a material reversal or further recognition 
of the deferred tax assets may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which the reversal or further recognition 
takes place. During the year, deferred tax assets of approximately US$6,703,000 (2019: US$2,563,000) in relation to unused tax losses 
were utilized.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20206.  Revenue

Revenue represents the fair value of the net amounts received and receivable for goods sold by the Group to outside customers, less 
returns and allowances, and commission and royalty income received during the year and is analyzed as follows:

Sales of goods

Commission and royalty income

2019
US$’000

7,641,865

24,856

9,811,941

7,666,721

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized at a point in time. Commission and royalty income is recognized over time.

The Group sells products mainly to the wholesale market. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred, being when 
the goods have been shipped to the wholesaler’s specific location (delivery).

Following delivery, the wholesaler has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary 
responsibility when on selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.

Revenue is recognized for sales which are considered highly probable and that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized 
will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for sales in which revenue has not yet been recognized. The Group’s right to recover the 
product when customers exercise their right to return products is recognized as a right to returned goods asset and a corresponding 
adjustment to cost of sales.

As at December 31, 2020, revenue for unsatisfied contracts to be recognized by the Group over one year is immaterial. As permitted by 
HKFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied contracts for contracts with period of one year or less is not disclosed.

7.  Other Income

Other income in both 2020 and 2019 mainly comprises of the sale of scrap materials and claims and reimbursements from customers 
and vendors.

8.  Interest Income

Interest income represents interest earned on bank deposits.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 202017.  Right of Use Assets (continued)

For both years, the Group leases land and buildings, office equipment, furniture and fixtures, plant and machinery, motor vehicles and 
aircraft for its operations. Lease contracts are entered into for term of up to 18 years (2019: 18 years). Lease terms are negotiated on an 
individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the 
non-cancellable period, the Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

In addition, the Group owns office buildings. The Group is the registered owner of these property interests, including the underlying 
leasehold lands. Lump sum payments were made upfront to acquire these property interests. The leasehold land components of these 
owned properties are presented separately only if the payments made can be allocated reliably.

The Group regularly entered into short-term leases for premises, plant and machinery and motor vehicles. As at December 31, 2020 and 
2019, the portfolio of short-term leases is similar to the portfolio of short-term leases to which the short-term lease expense disclosed 
above.

Leases Committed
As at December 31, 2020, the Group entered into new leases for certain PP&E that have not yet commenced, with average non-
cancellable period that ranges from 1 to 6 years (2019: 1 to 10 years) with extension options, the total future undiscounted cash flows 
under which amounts to US$7,294,000 (2019: US$33,475,000) over the non-cancellable period.

Details of the lease maturity analysis of the lease liabilities are set out in Note 33.

The retailer and service relationships were acquired through business combinations which related to the relationships with retailers and 
service centers.

Deferred development costs are internally-generated by capitalizing the costs pertaining to the development of new or enhancement of 
existing products.

Included in trademarks of the Group, US$224,440,000 (2019: US$227,640,000) are trademarks considered by the management of 
the Group as having indefinite useful lives because they are expected to contribute to the Group’s net cash inflows indefinitely. The 
trademarks will not be amortized until their useful lives are determined to be finite. Instead they will be tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Particulars of the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 20.

The above intangible assets, other than trademarks with indefinite useful lives, are amortized on a straight-line basis, at the following rates 
per annum:

Deferred development costs

Patents

Trademarks with finite useful lives

Manufacturing know-how

Retailer and service relationships

As explained in Note 5, the Group uses the types of goods sold for preparing the operating segment information. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives set out in Notes 18 and 19, the majority of the amounts have been 
allocated to four major individual cash-generating units (“CGUs”), including three units in the Power Equipment segment and one unit in 
the Floorcare segment. The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks as at December 31, 2020 allocated to these units are as follows:

In line with operation changes made during the year, the goodwill and intangible assets included in the Power Equipment – Baja CGU 
were aggregated to this Power Equipment – HCP as at December 31, 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, management of the Group wrote off goodwill of US$3,861,000 and trademarks of 
US$3,200,000 pertaining to amounts included in the Others CGU and Power Equipment Baja CGU respectively.

The basis of the recoverable amounts of the above CGUs and their major underlying assumptions are summarized below:

Power Equipment – MET (“MET”)
The recoverable amounts of MET’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period and a discount rate 
of 8.5% (2019: 10.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for MET are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on MET’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched, managing the working 
capital and the continuance of costs controlling strategy implemented by the Group. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are 
extrapolated using a steady 3.0% (2019: 3.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of MET’s goodwill and intangible assets to exceed the estimated recoverable amounts.

Power Equipment – HCP (“HCP”)
The recoverable amounts of HCP’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate 
of 10.0% (2019: 11.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for HCP are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on HCP’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the continuance of 
costs controlling strategy implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth 
rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of 
HCP’s goodwill and intangible assets to exceed the estimated recoverable amounts.

Power Equipment – Drebo (“Drebo”)
The recoverable amounts of Drebo’s goodwill have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 9.0% (2019: 10.0%) 
per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Drebo are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Drebo’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the continuance 
of costs controlling strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a 3.0% (2019: 1.0%) 
growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying 
amounts of Drebo’s goodwill to exceed the estimated recoverable amount.

Floorcare – RAM/Hoover/VAX (“RAM/Hoover/VAX”)
The recoverable amounts of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. 
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount 
rate of 12.5% (2019: 13.5%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for RAM/Hoover/VAX are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows 
including sales, gross margin, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The assumptions and 
estimations are based on RAM/Hoover/VAX’s past performance, management’s expectations of the market development, managing the 
working capital and the continuance of costs controlling strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are 
extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2019: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the estimated aggregate 
recoverable amounts.

The right to returned goods asset represents the Group’s right to recover products from customers where customers exercise their right 
of return under the Group’s various returns policies. The Group uses its accumulated historical experience to estimate the dollar value of 
returns on a portfolio level based on the expected return level.

The refund liabilities relate to customers’ right to return products within certain days of purchase. At the point of sale, a refund liability 
and a corresponding adjustment to revenue is recognized for the sold products expected to be returned. The Group uses its accumulated 
historical experience to estimate the dollar value of returns on a portfolio level based on the expected return level.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and 
defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly. Trade receivables that are neither past 
due nor impaired have the best credit scoring attributable under the internal credit scoring system used by the Group.

As at December 31, 2020, included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with aggregate carrying amount of 
US$307,439,000 (2019: US$334,794,000) which are past due as at the reporting date. The past due over 90 days balances that are 
presumed in default according with the Group’s accounting policy of US$254,508,000 (2019: US$303,196,000) are not considered as in 
default as they are due from a number of independent customers that have a good payment track record with the Group.

The Group had a policy of allowing credit periods ranging mainly from 30 days to 120 days.

In accordance with receivables purchase agreements, certain trade receivables have been factored to banks (the “Factored Trade 
Receivables”). As the Group still retained the risks associated in respect of default payments, the Group has continued to recognize 
the Factored Trade Receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position. At the end of the reporting period, proceeds from 
the Factored Trade Receivables of US$10,000,000 (2019: US$68,700,000) were recognized as liabilities and included in “Unsecured 
borrowings – due within one year” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

26. Bills Receivable

All the Group’s bills receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are aged within 120 days based on invoice date.

Acquisition Right of Certain PP&E
As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group owned a right to acquire certain PP&E which was acquired as part of the acquisition 
of the Oreck business from the Oreck Bankruptcy Estate. The right is expected to be exercised in 2032. The fair value of the PP&E 
was US$8,494,000 valued on September 30, 2020 (2019: US$8,929,000 valued on September 30, 2019) by Duff & Phelps, LLC., an 
independent valuer not related to the Group.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts under Hedge Accounting
At the end of the reporting period, the Group had the following foreign currency forward contracts designated as highly effective hedging 
instruments in order to manage the Group’s foreign currency exposure in relation to future foreign currency sales. The terms of the foreign 
exchange contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the respective designated hedged items.

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps
The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as effective hedging instrument to minimize its exposures to interest rate 
risk on US$ floating borrowings and foreign currency risk on the intercompany advances which affects the consolidated profit or loss.

The cross-currency interest rate swaps with notional amount of US$210,300,000 (2019: US$165,300,000) have fixed currency payments 
in EUR at exchange rate of EUR to US$ at 1.102 and 1.077 (2019: at 1.102), fixed interest payments monthly in EUR at 0.305% and 
0.520% per annum (2019: 0.305% per annum) for periods up until October 2023, October 2024, April 2024 and April 2025 (2019: 
October 2023 and October 2024).

The floating rate index and the currency exposure of the cross currency interest rate swaps match with the floating rate US$ bank 
borrowings and the currency exposure of the intercompany advances respectively.

As at December 31, 2020, a fair value loss of US$28,277,000 (December 31, 2019: fair value loss of US$2,425,000) has been 
recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in hedging reserve and is expected to the reclassified to profit or loss.

The fair value of the cross-currency interest swaps is determined by using the discounted cash flow method based on LIBOR yield curves 
and the forward exchange rates between US$ and EUR estimated at the end of the reporting period.

The Group is exposed to the LIBOR within its hedge accounting relationships, which are subject to interest rate benchmark reform. As 
disclosed above, the hedged item is the variable-rate US$ unsecured borrowings.

The Group has closely monitored the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to new 
benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators regarding the transition away from LIBOR. In response 
to the announcements, the Group has set up an LIBOR transition programme comprised of the following work streams: tax, treasury, legal, 
accounting and systems. The aim of the programme is to understand where LIBOR exposures are within the business and prepare and 
deliver on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative benchmark rates.

None of the Group’s current LIBOR linked contracts include adequate and robust fall back provisions for a cessation of the referenced 
benchmark interest rate. Different working groups in the industry are working on fall back language for different instruments and different 
LIBORs, which the Group is monitoring closely and will look to implement these when appropriate.

For the Group’s cross-currency interest rate swaps, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (“ISDA”) fall back clauses were 
made available at the end of 2019 and the Group will begin discussion with its banks with the aim to implement this language into its ISDA 
agreements within 2021.

28. Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps (continued)
For the Group’s variable-rate US$ unsecured borrowings, the Group has started discussions with the lenders to amend the US$ LIBOR 
unsecured borrowings so that the reference benchmark interest rate will change to Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The Group aims to 
finalise this amendment within 2021.

The Group will continue to apply the amendments to HKFRS 9 until the uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reforms 
with respect to the timing and the amount of the underlying cash flows that the Group is exposed ends. The Group has assumed that this 
uncertainty will not end until the Group’s LIBOR contracts are amended to specify the date on which the interest rate benchmark will be 
replaced, the cash flows of the alternative benchmark rate and the relevant spread adjustment. This will, in part, be dependent on the 
introduction of fall back clauses which have yet to be added to the Group’s contracts and the negotiation with lenders.

35. Capital Risk Management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return 
to shareholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balances. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from prior 
years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes unsecured borrowings, and discounted bills with recourse, net of cash 
and cash equivalents and equity attributable to Owners of the Company, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained profits.

Gearing Ratio
The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the management considers the cost 
of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a target gearing ratio of not exceeding 35% determined as the 
proportion of net debt to equity. The Group will continue to execute very disciplined control and management of its working capital and 
generate free cash inflows through the growth of the business.

The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:

In addition, based on management recommendations, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of 
dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

36.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group’s corporate treasury function provides risk management advice to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic 
and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyze exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These financial risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group seeks to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments or natural hedges to mitigate these 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies is reviewed internally on a continuous basis. 
The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

36.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

36.2.1 Foreign Currency Risk Management

Subsidiaries of the Group have foreign currency sales and purchases, which exposes the Group to foreign currency risk. 
Approximately 20.4% (2019: 21.0%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the group entity making the sale, whilst almost 14.4% (2019: 38.2%) of purchases are denominated in the group entity’s 
respective functional currency.

The carrying amounts of certain significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

1,715,483

137,377

2,017,052

Note:  For group entities with their functional currency as the US$, monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars have no 

material foreign currency risk exposure as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged with the US$.

The Group requires its group entities to use foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the currency exposure. The 
exchange forward contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. On this basis, the Group has entered into 
forward contracts in relation to the foreign currency amounting to US$946,737,000 (2019: US$660,461,000). It is the 
Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximize hedge 
effectiveness (see Note 28 for details).

The Group also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce currency exposure to hedge against the debts which are 
effective to convert the foreign currency debts to the functional currency of the relevant group entity. The critical terms of 
these currency swaps are similar to those of hedged borrowings.

Sensitivity Analysis
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% (2019: 5%) increase and decrease in the functional currency 
against foreign currency without considering the cross-currency interest rate swaps entered at end of the reporting period. 
5% (2019: 5%) is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in the foreign exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis 
includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and excludes the effect of cross-currency interest 
rate swaps held at the reporting date. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit for the year where functional 
currency weakens 5% (2019: 5%) against foreign currency.

36.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

36.2.2  Interest Rate Risk Management

The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section 
of this note. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate borrowing (see Note 37 for details 
of these borrowings), discounted bills with recourse, bank balances and deposits. The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk is 
mainly concentrated on LIBOR arising from the Group’s US$ and EUR denominated borrowings. In relation to interest bearing 
bank balances and deposits, the Group considers the interest rate risk to be low. The management continuously monitors 
interest rate fluctuations and will consider further hedging the interest rate risk should the need arise.

The Group is also exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to fixed-rate bank borrowings (see Note 37 for details of 
these borrowings) and lease liabilities.

During the year, the Group obtained new bank borrowings of US$3,694 million (2019: US$4,042 million) which are either at 
a fixed rate or LIBOR based. The proceeds were used for refinancing the Group’s borrowings.

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some 
interbank offered rates with alternative nearly risk-free rates. The Group is closely monitoring the transition to new benchmark 
interest rates.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at 
the end of the reporting period. The analysis is prepared assuming the financial instruments outstanding at the end of the 
reporting period was outstanding for the whole year without considering the cross-currency interest rate swaps entered at the 
end of the reporting period. A 50 basis points (2019: 50 basis points) increase or decrease in LIBOR is used when reporting 
interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points (2019: 50 basis points) higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s post-tax profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 would decrease/increase by US$3,992,000 (2019: 
decrease/increase by US$6,120,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate 
borrowings.

The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the decrease in variable-rate 
debt instruments.

36.2.3  Other Price Risk

The Group is exposed to price risk mainly through its listed equity securities.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of listed equity securities 
measured at fair value at the reporting date.

If the prices of the listed equity securities had been 10% higher, the profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the 
Group would increase by US$1,776,000 (2019: increase by US$2,460,000) as a result of the changes in the fair values of 
the listed equity securities.

36.2.4  Credit Risk Management and Impairment Assessment

As at December 31, 2020, other than those financial assets whose carrying amounts best represent the maximum exposure 
to credit risk of US$2,913,062,000 (2019: US$2,652,964,000), the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will 
cause a financial loss to the Group arising from the amount of financial guarantees provided by the Group is disclosed in  
Note 42. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit risk associated with its 
financial assets.

36.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)
36.2.4  Credit Risk Management and Impairment Assessment (continued)

Trade receivables arising from contracts with customers
In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of 
credit limits and credit approvals. Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to 
assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers 
are reviewed twice a year. Other monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover 
overdue debts. In addition, the Group performs impairment assessment using an ECL model upon application of HKFRS 9 
based on a provision matrix. In this regard, the directors of the Company consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly 
reduced.

The Group has concentration of credit risk as 35.0% (2019: 25.8%) and 53.6% (2019: 42.8%) of the total trade receivables 
were due from the Group’s largest customer and the five largest customers respectively. In order to minimize the credit risk, 
the management of Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits and credit approvals.

Bank balances
The credit risks on bank balances are limited because the counterparties are banks/financial institutions with high credit 
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group’s internal credit risk grading assessment comprises the following categories:

Internal credit rating

Description

Trade receivables

1. 

Trade receivables from associates and other receivables amounted to US$4,240,000 and US$60,230,000 (2019: US$6,494,000 and 

US$67,472,000) respectively have no fixed repayment terms. The Group has assessed these balances on a 12-month ECL basis as there has 

been no significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition.

2. 

For trade receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach in HKFRS 9 to measure the loss allowance at lifetime ECL. The Group 

determines the ECL on these items by using a provision matrix grouped by internal credit rating.

3. 

For financial guarantee contracts, the gross carrying amount in 2019 represented the maximum amount the Group had guaranteed under the 

respective contracts.

As part of the Group’s credit risk management, the Group applies internal credit rating for its customers in relation to its 
operation. The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables which are 
assessed collectively as at December 31, 2020.

The estimated loss rates are estimated based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the debtors and 
forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. The grouping is regularly reviewed by management 
to ensure relevant information about specific debtors is updated.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group provided US$52,932,000 (2019: US$34,529,000) for credit losses 
allowances for trade receivables.

The Group writes off trade receivables when there is information indicating that the debtors are in severe financial difficulties 
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate 
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities.

As at December 31, 2020, the Group has available unutilized overdrafts facilities and short and medium term bank 
loan facilities of approximately US$351 million (2019: US$345 million) and US$2,220 million (2019: US$1,506 million) 
respectively.

Liquidity Tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities and derivative instruments. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flow of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 
which the Group can be required to pay. The maturity dates for non-derivative financial liabilities are based on agreed 
repayment dates. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that the interest flows are floating 
rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from the interest rate curve at the end of the reporting period.

In addition, the following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual net cash inflows and (outflows) on derivative instruments that settle 
on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross inflows and (outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When 
the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the foreign currency exchange 
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The liquidity analysis for the Group’s derivative financial instruments are 
prepared based on the contractual maturities/settlement as the management considers that the contractual maturities are 
essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.

36.2.5  Liquidity Risk Management (continued)

Liquidity Tables (continued)
The amount included above for variable interest rate instruments for non-derivative financial liabilities is subject to change if 
changes in variable interest rates differ to those estimates of interest rate determined at the end of the reporting period.

36.3 Fair Value

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contract;

the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is measured by the present value of future cash flows estimated and 
discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and foreign exchange rates between US$ 
and EUR, which is observable at the end of the reporting period;

the fair value of financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with 
reference to quoted market bid prices or latest purchase/transaction prices; and

the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions.

Fair Value Measurements Recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The 
following table gives information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined (in 
particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used), as well as the level of the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value 
measurements are categorized (Levels 1 to 3) based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are 
observable.

• 

• 

• 

Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;

Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Group owns equity interest in a private company incorporated in the US that is classified as financial assets at FVTPL and is 
measured at fair value at the reporting date.

There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year.

36.4 Transfers of Financial Assets

The following were the Group’s financial assets as at December 31, 2020 that were transferred to banks by discounting or factoring 
those trade and bills receivables on a full recourse basis. As the Group retained substantially all of the significant risks and rewards 
relating to these receivables, it continues to recognize the full carrying amount of the receivables and has recognized the cash 
received on the transfer as discounted bills with recourse (see Note 34) and unsecured borrowings – due within one year  
(see Note 37). These financial assets are carried at amortized cost in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.

The trade and bills receivables discounted with banks with full recourse at the year end was as follows:

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 202040. Retirement Benefit Obligations

Defined Contribution Plans:
The Company and its subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong have participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (“MPF Schemes”) 
registered under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance since December 2000. The assets of the MPF Schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group, in funds under the control of trustees. The Group contributes 5% of relevant payroll cost to the MPF 
Schemes with a maximum amount of HK$18,000 (2019: HK$18,000) per employee per annum, which contribution is matched by the 
employee.

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are members of a state-managed retirement benefit 
scheme operated by the PRC government. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the 
retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make 
the specified contributions.

The Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes 
applicable to each year are made at a certain percentage of the employees’ payroll.

The total expense recognized in profit or loss of US$17,997,000 (2019: US$14,341,000) represents contributions payable to these plans 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Defined Benefits Plans:
The Group operates several defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Germany and the US, of which these plans 
cover substantially all remaining employees that are not covered by defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are administered 
by separate funds that are legally separated from the Group. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number of 
representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its articles of 
association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, employers. The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The major 
defined benefit plans are as follows:

Pension plan obligations (Note i)

Life and medical insurance plan (Note ii)

Post-employment benefit plan obligations (Note iii)

The pension plan obligations are provided in the German operations and includes an unfunded plan that pays retirement benefits based on the term of service 

and final pay. In general, the benefit plans were closed to new members at the end of 1995. Under the plan, the qualifying employees are entitled to retirement 

benefits varying between 10% and 20% of final salary (based on the average of the last three years) on attainment of a retirement age of 65. The most recent 

actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out on January 1, 2021, by BDO AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, 

Germany, an independent valuer not related to the Group.

Note ii: Life and medical insurance plan

Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the US, operates unfunded life insurance plans. The most recent actuarial valuations of the 

present value of the obligations were carried out on December 21, 2020 by Willis Towers Watson, an independent valuer not related to the Group.

Note iii: Post-employment benefit plan obligations

The pension plan obligations are provided by Hoover Inc. for members of IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) Local 1985 employed by 

Hoover. The most recent actuarial valuation of the present value of the obligations were carried out on January 9, 2021 by CBIZ Benefits & Insurance Services, 

an independent valuer not related to the Group.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 202040. Retirement Benefit Obligations (continued)

Defined Benefits Plans: (continued)
The plans in Germany and the US expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary 
risk.

Investment risk

Interest rate risk

Longevity risk

Salary risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference 
to high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality 
of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan 
participants will increase the plan’s liability.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependents of plan members (widow and orphan benefits) is reinsured by an external 
insurance company.

The main actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

The plan assets of the post-employment benefit plan are cash and cash equivalents in a Federated Money Market Fund with an expected 
return of 4.14% (2019: 4.14%).

The actual return on plan assets was US$54,000 (2019: US$168,000).

The significant actuarial assumption for the determination of the defined obligation is the discount rate. If the discount rate is 100 basis 
points higher (lower), the effect on defined benefit obligation would be immaterial.

The Group expects to make a contribution of US$Nil (2019: US$4,700,000) to the defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group has unused tax losses of US$1,916 million (2019: US$1,737 million) available for offset 
against future taxable profits. Of the US$1,916 million of unused losses approximately US$447 million expire over the next 8 to 17 years 
with the remaining loss carryforwards having no useful life limitation. No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of tax losses of 
US$1,802 million (2019: US$1,615 million) due to the lack of probable future taxable profits.

In respect of all unrepatriated foreign earnings, the Group has provided deferred taxes of US$13 million (2019: US$13 million) as these 
unrepatriated foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested.

43. Share Options

Share Option Schemes
The Company has two share option schemes in place – Scheme D and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired 
on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, 
Scheme E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the eligible 
persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal terms 
of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:

(i) 

employees; or

(ii)  Directors; or

(iii) 

secondees; or

(iv) 

any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued 
by any member of the Group; or

(v) 

business partners; or

(vi) 

suppliers; or

(vii)  customers; or

(viii)  advisers of the Group.

Share options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by the 
Board of Directors for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at any time, subject to vesting conditions from the date of grant to 
the tenth anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share 
option; or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading days 
immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options may be granted under the respective share option scheme is not 
permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time or 10.0% of the shares in issue as at the 
adoption date of the respective share option scheme. No person shall be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as 
at the date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first or second anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of (i) the closing 
price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant; and (ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days immediately 
preceding the date of grant.

The share options are vested in parts over 1 to 3 years from the date of grant.

Expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioral considerations.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the volatility of the share price. 
Because changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the directors’ opinion, the existing model 
does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the share options.

The weighted average closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the various dates on which the share options were 
granted during 2020 was HK$98.44 (2019: HK$50.15).

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 202044. Share Award Scheme

The purpose of the share award scheme is to recognize the contributions by certain eligible persons and to provide them with incentives in 
order to retain them for the continual operation and development of the Group and to attract suitable personnel for further development of 
the Group.

The share award scheme of the Company was adopted by the Board of Directors on January 9, 2008 and renewed on January 17, 2018. 
The Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select any eligible person for participation in the scheme as a selected 
grantee and determine the number of shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The Board of Directors are required 
to pay the trustee the purchase price and the related expenses. The trustee must either purchase shares from the market or subscribe 
for new shares. The trustee must hold the shares until they are vested in accordance with the scheme rules. When the selected grantee 
has satisfied all vesting conditions specified by the Board of Directors at the time of making the award and becomes entitled to the shares 
forming the subject of the award, the trustee will transfer the relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of 
accrued interest) to the selected grantee.

An award of shares automatically lapses when, (i) a selected grantee who is an employee ceases to be an employee; or (ii) the subsidiary 
by which a selected grantee is employed ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company (or of a member of the Group); or (iii) a selected 
grantee who is a director of the Company or a subsidiary ceases to be a director of the same; or (iv) an order for the winding-up of the 
Company is made or a resolution is passed (otherwise than for certain purposes) for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, and, in any 
such case, the award, unless the Board otherwise agrees, automatically lapses forthwith and all the awarded shares and related income of 
such award do not vest on the relevant vesting date but become returned shares for the purpose of the scheme.

Recognition of share-based payment expenses under the share award scheme during the year was US$14,569,000 (2019: 
US$4,156,000). During the year ended December 31, 2020, 2,364,000 shares (2019: 451,000 shares) were transferred to the awardees 
upon vesting.
