CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

I am pleased with the sustained 
progress made in new product 
development and our excellent 
productivity gains, which are  
the catalysts for sales and  
profit growth.

I am pleased to announce that in 2012 TTI delivered record sales, 
record profit and record cash flow. Our disciplined implementation 
of the TTI strategic plan is yielding outstanding results across all 
of our business units and geographic regions. I am particularly 
pleased with the sustained progress made in new product 
development and our excellent productivity gains, which are the 
catalysts for sales and profit growth. These results once again 
demonstrate the fundamental strengths of TTI’s focus on our 
strategic drivers of Powerful Brands, Innovative Products, 
Operational Excellence and Exceptional People.

Record Performance
Group sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 rose by  
5.1% over 2011 to USD3.9 billion as we delivered organic growth 
in all geographic regions. Gross profit margin improved for the 
fourth straight year to 33.5% from 32.6% last year on further 
productivity gains in our operations, the introduction of new

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

products, and strong growth in our industrial power tools 
business. 2012 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) increased 
by 18.6% to USD260 million, with the margin improving by  
80 basis points to 6.8%. Lowered interest expenses as a result  
of a reduction in debt helped profit attributable to shareholders  
of the Company rise by 32.2% to USD201 million, with earnings  
per share increasing by 20.6% over 2011 to US11.42 cents.

Sales of our largest business unit, Power Equipment, rose by 
7.6% to USD2.9 billion, accounting for 74.4% of total sales, 
against 72.6% in 2011. Our own brand Floor Care and Appliance 
business improved, but our strategic exit of non-profitable OEM 
business resulted in a slight overall sales decline to USD1.0 billion. 
Sales in our core North America and Europe businesses 
increased, while our strategic geographic expansion achieved 
another year of solid growth with Rest-of-World (ROW) sales up  
by 8.7%. New products again accounted for about one third  
of our sales.

Higher revenues and operational efficiency drove positive  
free cash flow to a record USD275 million. Working capital as  
a percentage of sales improved from 18.9% in 2011 to 16.2% 
and gearing reduced to 25.8% at the end of 2012, from 59.3%  
at the end of 2011.

I am pleased to announce that the Board is recommending  
a final dividend of HK10.75 cents (approximately US1.38 cents) 
per share, an increase of 38.7%. Together with the interim 
dividend of HK6.75 cents (approximately US0.87 cents)  
per share, this will result in a full-year dividend of HK17.50 cents 
(approximately US2.25 cents) per share, against HK12.75 cents 
(approximately US1.64 cents) per share in 2011, an increase  
of 37.3%.

Innovative Products
In 2011 MILWAUKEE® rolled out its state-of-the-art REDLITHIUM™ 
platform, which transformed the cordless power tools industry.  
In 2012 we launched FUEL®, a combination of REDLITHIUM™,  
a revolutionary design of brushless motor and state-of-the-art 
on-board electronics. FUEL® takes the performance of lithium ion 
power tools to yet another level, with longer runtime, improved 
motor life and increased power. We are now rolling out a range  
of M12® FUEL® sub-compact cordless power tools that will set  
a new benchmark for professional and industrial end-users.  
Our MILWAUKEE® accessories and hand tool programs have been 
highly successful with a series of innovative high performance 
products targeting new categories that are demanded by 
professional and industrial users.

The RYOBI® outdoor business experienced exceptional growth 
with our broad line of innovative lithium ion powered outdoor 
products leading the way. Lithium ion powered outdoor products 
offer clear advantages to the end-user and we plan to invest 
further in this exciting space. RYOBI® ONE+ System® is a world 
leader in the consumer segment of cordless power tools, the 
fastest growing segment in the industry. We have built on our 
broad installed user base by continuing to roll out upgraded 
lithium ion batteries and innovative tools powered by the  
RYOBI® ONE+ System®. We are excited about our potential  
to further increase household penetration and provide more  
highly innovative products to our loyal end-users.

I am delighted with our progress on the revitalization of our global 
Floor Care business. We are in the process of rolling out a new 
generation of HOOVER®, VAX® and DIRT DEVIL® products that  
will drive market share gains while continuing to improve the 
profitability of the business. We are very encouraged with the 
support from our Floor Care retail partners worldwide and the 
positive response from end-users for our new products.

Successful Productivity Efforts
The improvement in gross margin was driven in large part by  
our relentless focus on cost management, continued emphasis  
on value engineering and higher productivity throughout our 
operations, as we benefit increasingly from our global purchasing 
initiatives and the efficiencies of our Asia Industrial Park. Our 
success in these areas has been a major contributor to our gross 
margin improvement in 2012 and will continue to be in the  
years to come.

Focused Geographic Expansion
We announced a strategic initiative to expand our businesses  
into under-represented geographic markets. We are pleased  
to report that the results have been encouraging and we have 
expanded and established our presence with talented leadership 
in high-potential markets around the world. Our teams in Canada, 
Western Europe, Central Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, 
Australia and Asia all made progress in 2012. These markets  
are benefiting from our focused marketing strategies and global 
new product development process.

At TTI we believe that we still have vast potential for growth.  

An outstanding team is in place and our vision is clear. I am 

pleased with the results we have achieved over the past three 

years. We are poised to achieve even higher levels of success in 

the years ahead. Our visionary Chairman, Mr Horst Pudwill, has 

challenged us to be Number One in our markets. This bold vision

Generate Free Cash Flow 

By improving our working capital management and ensuring  

the most efficient use of CAPEX in our businesses. 

We have driven free cash flow to a record high in 2012 and 

reduced working capital as a percentage of sales to a very 

efficient 16.2%, a tremendous improvement from the 2009  

level of 20.9%.

What is really exciting here at TTI is that we are just getting 

started. The next three years will require even more aggressive 

initiatives to deliver further sales growth, market share gains and 

better financial performance. With our brands, product platforms, 

organizational structure and processes already in place, we have 

a solid foundation from which to unleash the next level of 

expansion. The industries in which we compete offer opportunities 

to drive deeper and broader in all product categories, enter 

closely aligned businesses and continue to expand geographically 

with our key brands.

Floor care and Appliances margins improved significantly, but  
sales fell slightly by 1.6% over 2011 to USD1.0 billion following  
a rationalization of the business which has seen non-performing 
operations cut and expenses reduced in North America. Our global 
product development process and centralized purchasing initiatives  
are bringing benefits. Key gains were made in Europe, with double-digit 
revenue growth, while global new products sales were maintained at

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF TECHTRONIC INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED

創科實業有限公司
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) set out on pages 58 to 160, which comprise the consolidated and Company statements of 
financial position as at December 31, 2012, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.

Directors’ Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the 
Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit and to report our opinion solely 
to you, as a body, in accordance with section 141 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for no other purpose. We do not assume 
responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
Hong Kong Standards on Auditing issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group 
as at December 31, 2012, and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial 
Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2012

1. 

General

The Company is a public limited company incorporated in Hong Kong and its shares are listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong 
Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). The address of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company is 24/F., 

CDW Building, 388 Castle Peak Road, Tsuen Wan, N.T., Hong Kong.

The principal activities of the Group are the manufacturing and trading of electrical and electronic products.

The functional currency of the Company is United States dollars. The presentation currency has been changed from Hong Kong 

Dollars to United States Dollars in 2011 so as to be consistent with the functional currency of the Company.

2. 

Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”)

In the current year, the Group and the Company have applied the following revised and amendments to HKFRSs issued by the 
Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”):

Amendments to HKAS 12

HKAS 19 (as revised in 2011)

Amendments to HKFRS 7

Deferred Tax – Recovery of Underlying Assets;

Employee Benefits;

Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Transfers of

  Financial Assets; and

Amendments to HKAS 1

As part of the Annual Improvements to HKFRSs 2009-2011

  Cycle issued in 2012.

Except as described below, the application of the revised and amendments to HKFRSs in the current year has had no material 
impact on the Group’s and the Company’s financial performance and positions for the current and prior years and/or on the 

disclosures set out in these consolidated financial statements.

HKAS 19 (as revised in 2011) Employee Benefits
The Group has early adopted HKAS 19 (as revised in 2011) in advance of its effective date of January 1, 2013. The amendments 

to HKAS 19 change the accounting for defined benefit plans and plan assets. The most significant change relates to the 

accounting for changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets. The amendments require the recognition of changes in 
defined benefit obligations and in the fair value of plan assets when they occur, and hence eliminate the “corridor approach” 

permitted under the previous version of HKAS 19. The amendments require all actuarial gains and losses to be recognised 

immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net pension asset or liability recognised in the consolidated 

statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the plan deficit or surplus.

Furthermore, the interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of HKAS 19 are replaced with a 
“net-interest” amount, which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

The amendments to HKAS 19 require retrospective application with certain exceptions. The comparative figures presented in the 

consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of 

cash flow were restated with the application of the amendments to HKAS 19. The application to the amendment to HKAS 19 has 

had no impact on the consolidated statement of financial position for the current and prior years.

Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

Amendments to HKFRS 7 Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
The Group has applied for the first time the amendments to HKFRS 7 Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets in the current 

year. The amendments increase the disclosure requirements for transactions involving the transfer of financial assets in order to 

provide greater transparency around risk exposures when financial assets are transferred.

The Group has arrangements with banks to transfer to the banks its contractual rights to receive cash flows from certain trade 

receivables. The arrangements are made through discounting to the banks on a full recourse basis. Specifically, if the trade 

receivables are not paid at maturity, the banks have the right to request the Group to pay the unsettled balance. As the Group 

has not transferred the significant risks and rewards relating to these trade receivables, it continues to recognise the full carrying 

amount of the receivables and has recognised the cash on the transfer as secured borrowings. The relevant disclosures have been 

made in Note 40.4 regarding the transfer of these trade receivables on application of the amendments to HKFRS 7.

Amendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
(as part of the Annual Improvements to HKFRSs 2009-2011 Cycle issued in June 2012)
Various amendments to HKFRSs were issued in June 2012, the title of which is Annual Improvements to HKFRSs (2009 – 2011 

Cycle). The effective date of these amendments is annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.

In the current year, the Group has applied for the first time the amendments to HKAS 1 in advance of the effective date (annual 

periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013).

HKAS 1 requires an entity that changes accounting policies retrospectively, or makes a retrospective restatement or 

reclassification, to present a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period (third statement of financial 

position). The amendments to HKAS 1 clarify that an entity is required to present a third statement of financial position only when 

the retrospective application, restatement or reclassification has a material effect on the information in the third statement of 

financial position and that related notes are not required to accompany the third statement of financial position.

In the current year, the Group has applied the HKAS 19 (as revised in 2011) Employee Benefits for the first time, which has 

resulted in no material effect on the information in the consolidated statement of financial position as at January 1, 2011. In 

accordance with the amendments to HKAS 1, the Group therefore did not present a third statement of financial position as at 

January 1, 2011.

HKFRS 9 Financial Instruments
HKFRS 9 issued in 2009 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. HKFRS 9 

amended in 2010 includes the requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition.

Key requirements of HKFRS 9 are described as follows:

(cid:116) 

With regards to financial assets, HKFRS 9 requires all recognised financial assets that are within the scope of HKAS 

39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value. 

Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, 

and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding, are 

generally measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. All other debt investments and equity 

investments are measured at their fair values at the end of subsequent reporting periods. In addition, under HKFRS 9, 

entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is 

not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognised in profit or loss. The 
adoption of HKFRS 9 will require the Group’s and the Company’s available-for-sale investments that are currently measured 

at cost less impairment to be measured at fair value instead of being measured at cost.

For the year ended December 31, 2012

2. 

Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

HKFRS 9 Financial Instruments (continued)
The directors anticipate that the adoption of HKFRS 9 in the future may have an impact on amounts reported in respect of the 
Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities. However, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of that effect until a 

detailed review has been completed.

New and revised Standards on consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosures
In June 2011, a package of five standards on consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosures was issued, including 

HKFRS 10, HKFRS 11, HKFRS 12, HKAS 27 (as revised in 2011) and HKAS 28 (as revised in 2011).

Key requirements of these five standards are described below.

HKFRS 10 replaces the parts of HKAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that deal with consolidated financial 

statements and HK (SIC)-Int 12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. HKFRS 10 includes a new definition of control that 

contains three elements: (a) power over an investee, (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee, and (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Extensive guidance has 

been added in HKFRS 10 to deal with complex scenarios.

HKFRS 12 is a disclosure standard and is applicable to entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates 

and/or unconsolidated structured entities. In general, the disclosure requirements in HKFRS 12 are more extensive than those in 

the current standards.

In July 2012, the amendments to HKFRS 10, HKFRS 11 and HKFRS 12 were issued to clarify certain transitional guidance on the 

application of these five HKFRSs for the first time.

These five standards, together with the amendments relating to the transitional guidance, are effective for annual periods 

beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier application is permitted provided that all of these five standards are applied early at 

the same time.

The directors anticipate that these five standards will be adopted in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the annual 

period beginning January 1, 2013. The directors anticipate that the application of these Standards will have no material impact on 

the financial statements.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

2. 

Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

HKFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
HKFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. 

The Standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value 

measurements. The scope of HKFRS 13 is broad; it applies to both financial instrument items and non-financial instrument 

items for which other HKFRSs require or permit fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements, except 

in specified circumstances. In general, the disclosure requirements in HKFRS 13 are more extensive than those in the current 

standards. For example, quantitative and qualitative disclosures based on the three-level fair value hierarchy currently required for 

financial instruments only under HKFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures will be extended by HKFRS 13 to cover all assets 

and liabilities within its scope.

HKFRS 13 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with earlier application permitted.

The directors anticipate that HKFRS 13 will be adopted in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the annual period 

beginning January 1, 2013 and that the application of the new Standard may affect the amounts reported in the consolidated 

financial statements and result in more extensive disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
The amendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income introduce new terminology for the statement 
of comprehensive income and income statement. Under the amendments to HKAS 1, a “statement of comprehensive income” is 
renamed as a “statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income” and an “income statement” is renamed as a “statement 
of profit or loss”.

The amendments to HKAS 1 retain the option to present profit or loss and other comprehensive income in either a single 

statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. However, the amendments to HKAS 1 require additional disclosures 

to be made in the other comprehensive income section such that items of other comprehensive income are grouped into two 

categories: (a) items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss; and (b) items that may be reclassified subsequently 

to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. Income tax on items of other comprehensive income is required to be allocated 

on the same basis.

The amendments to HKAS 1 are effective for the Group’s annual period beginning on January 1, 2013. The presentation of items 

of other comprehensive income will be modified accordingly when the amendments are applied in the future accounting periods.

The directors anticipate that the application of the other new and revised HKFRSs will have no material impact on the Group’s 

financial performance and financial position for the current and prior year and/or on the disclosures set out in these consolidated 

financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. In addition, the 

consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The 

Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, 

which are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies set out below. Historical cost is generally based on the 

fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 

(its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity 

so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 

income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with 

those used by other members of the Group.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity therein.

Allocation of total comprehensive income to non-controlling interests
Total comprehensive income and expense of a subsidiary is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 

interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance (effective from January 1, 2010 onwards).

Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in existing subsidiaries
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are 
accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 

to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling 

interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to 

owners of the Company.

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it (i) derecognises the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary 

at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost, (ii) derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in 

the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost (including any components of other comprehensive income attributable to 

them), and (iii) recognises the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, 

with any resulting difference being recognised as a gain or loss in profit or loss attributable to the Group. Where certain assets 

of the subsidiary are carried at revalued amounts or fair values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in 

other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and 

accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets (i.e. reclassified to profit or 

loss or transferred directly to retained earnings as specified by applicable HKFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in 

the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting 

under HKAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an 

investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Business Combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 

combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred 

by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in 

exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the 

acquisition date, except that:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 

measured in accordance with HKAS 12 Income Taxes and HKAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share based payment 

arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 

accordance with HKFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date (see the accounting policy below); and

assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 

and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 

amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after re-assessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts 

of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net 
assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate 
share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a 

transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value or, when applicable, on 

the basis specified in another standard.

Where the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a 

contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and considered 

as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration 

that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with the corresponding adjustments made 

against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 
“measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at 

the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 

adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 

remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 

that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with HKAS 39, or HKAS 37 

Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in 

profit or loss.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Business Combinations (continued)
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to 

fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control), and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised 

in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised 

in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were 

disposed of.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 

occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are 

adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information 

obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts 

recognised as of that date.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is presented 

separately in the consolidated statement of financial position.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (or groups of cash 

generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever there 

is indication that the unit may be impaired. For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a reporting period, the cash generating unit to 

which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment before the end of that reporting period.

If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash generating unit, the impairment 

loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro 

rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit 

or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 

subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the amount 

of profit or loss on disposal.

Investments in Subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are included in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any identified impairment 

losses. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends received and receivable.

74

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

3. 

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Interests in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 

venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 

control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity 

method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement 
of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income of the associates. When the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in that associate 
(which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group 

discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of that associate.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 

liabilities of an associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying 

amount of the investment.

Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of 

acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

The requirements of HKAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect 
to the Group’s investment in an associate. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is 

tested for impairment in accordance with HKAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount 

(higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the 

carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with HKAS 36 to the extent 

that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.

Upon disposal of an associate that results in the Group losing significant influence over that associate, any retained investment 

is measured at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition as a financial asset in 

accordance with HKAS 39. The difference between the previous carrying amount of the associate attributable to the retained 

interest and its fair value is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group 

accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as 

would be required if that associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously 

recognised in other comprehensive income by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related 

assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when it 

loses significant influence over that associate.

Where a group entity transacts with its associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 

in the relevant associate.

Investments in associates are included in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any identified impairment 

losses. The results of associates are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends received and receivable.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired separately

Intangible assets acquired separately and with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 

accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over 

their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, 

with the effective of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Alternatively, intangible assets with 

indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses (see the 

accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on tangible and intangible assets below).

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or 

losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 

carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognised.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised separately from goodwill and are initially measured at their 

fair value at the acquisition date. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 

accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over 

their estimated useful lives.

Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses 

(see the accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on tangible and intangible assets below).

Research and Development Expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is 

recognised only if all of the following have been demonstrated:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 

intangible asset; and

the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

76

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

3. 

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Intangible Assets (continued)

Research and Development Expenditure (continued)

The amount initially recognised for an internally-generated intangible asset is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date 

when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, 

development expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, an internally-generated intangible asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 

accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 

to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

The Group and the Company as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the Company at their fair value at the inception of the 

lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 

consolidation statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 

of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are 
directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing 

costs (see the accounting policy below).

Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except 

where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefit from the leased assets are 

consumed.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The 

aggregate benefits of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis except 

where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefit from the leased assets are 

consumed.

Leasehold land and building
When a lease includes both land and building elements, the Group and the Company assess the classification of each element 

as a finance or an operating lease separately based on the assessment as to whether substantially all the risks and rewards 

incidental to ownership of each element have been transferred to the Group or the Company, unless it is clear that both elements 

are operating leases in which case the entire lease is classified as an operating lease. Specifically, the minimum lease payments 

(including any lump-sum upfront payments) are allocated between the land and the building elements in proportion to the relative 

fair values of the leasehold interests in the land element and building element of the lease at the inception of the lease.

To the extent the allocation of the lease payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold land that is accounted for as an 
operating lease is presented as “lease payments” in the consolidated statement of financial position and is amortised over the 

lease term on a straight-line basis. When the lease payments cannot be allocated reliably between the land and building elements, 

the entire lease is generally classified as a finance lease and accounted for as property, plant and equipment, unless it is clear that 

both elements are operating leases, in which case the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment including buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for 

administrative purposes, other than construction in progress, are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost 

less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and construction 

in progress, over their estimated useful lives and after taking into account of their estimated residual value, using the straight-line 

method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and defined depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 

period with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Construction in progress includes property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production or for its own 

use purposes. Construction in progress is carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees 
capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Construction in progress is classified to the appropriate category of 

property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for its intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as 

other property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 

shorter, the term of the relevant lease. However, when there is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be obtained by the end 

of the lease term, assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to 

arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 

between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the item 

is derecognised.

Impairment Losses on tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill (see the accounting policy in respect of goodwill above)
At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company review the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether 

there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 

of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the 

recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 

the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated 

to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a 

reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least 

annually, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 

future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 

the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 

amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 

immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash generating unit is increased to the 

revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 

would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or a cash generating unit in prior years. A 

reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

3. 

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when a group entity 

becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 

acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 

through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 

on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Assets
The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets are classified into one of the three categories, including financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends 

on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. All regular way purchases or 

sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases 

or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the 

marketplace.

Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income 

over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all 

fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 

through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial 

recognition.

Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at 

FVTPL, of which interest income is included in net gains or losses.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading.

A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; or

it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern 

of short-term profit-taking; or

it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value arising from remeasurement recognised directly 

in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest 

earned on the financial assets.

Financial Instruments (continued)

Financial Assets (continued)

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 

market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables, amounts due from 

associates, bills receivable, trade receivables from associates, loans to subsidiaries, amounts due from subsidiaries and bank 

balances, deposits and cash) are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any identified impairment 

losses (see accounting policy in respect of impairment of financial assets below).

Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated or not classified as financial assets at FVTPL, loans 

and receivables or held-to-maturity investments.

For available-for-sale equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot 

be reliably measured, they are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period (see 

accounting policy in respect of impairment of financial assets below).

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 

recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have been affected.

For all other financial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or

default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or

it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.

For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables and trade receivables from associates, assets that are assessed 

not to be impaired individually are, in addition, subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence 
of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s and the Company’s past experience of collecting payments, 

an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 to 120 days, or observable 

changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.

For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 

interest rate.

For financial assets carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 

amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar 

financial asset. Such impairment loss will not be reversed in subsequent periods.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments (continued)

Financial Assets (continued)

Impairment of financial assets (continued)

The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of 

trade receivables and trade receivables from associates, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance 

account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss. When a trade receivable is 

considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 

are credited to profit or loss.

When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the impairment takes place.

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the 

decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the previously recognised 

impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is 

reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity investments will not be reversed through profit or loss in subsequent periods. Any 

increase in fair value subsequent to impairment loss is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Financial Liabilities and Equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by a group entity are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in 

accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an 

equity instrument.

Equity instrument

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group and the Company after deducting 

all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group and the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct 

issue costs.

Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 

over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all 

fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or 

discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 

initial recognition.

Interest expense is recognised on an effective interest basis.

Convertible bonds

Convertible bonds issued by the Group and the Company that contain both liability and conversion option components are 

classified separately into their respective items on initial recognition. Conversion options that will be settled by the exchange of a 
fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments are classified as an 

equity instrument. Embedded derivatives, including early redemption options, which are closely related to the liability components 

are not separately accounted for.

On initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component is determined using the prevailing market interest of similar non-convertible 

debts. The difference between the gross proceeds of the issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability 

component, representing the conversion option for the holder to convert the bonds into equity, is included in equity (convertible bonds 

equity reserve).

In subsequent periods, the liability component of the convertible bonds is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 

method. The equity component, representing the option to convert the liability component into ordinary shares of the Company, 

will remain in the convertible bonds equity reserve until the embedded option is exercised (in which case the balance stated in the 

convertible bonds equity reserve will be transferred to share premium). Where the option remains unexercised at the expiry date, 

the balance stated in the convertible bonds equity reserve will be released to retained profits. No gain or loss is recognised in profit 

or loss upon conversion or expiration of the option.

Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the convertible bonds are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion 

to the allocation of the gross proceeds. Transaction costs relating to the equity component are charged directly to equity. 

Transaction costs relating to the liability component are included in the carrying amount of the liability portion and amortised over 

the period of the convertible bonds using the effective interest method.

Upon early redemption of the convertible bonds, the early redemption consideration will be allocated to the liability component and 

equity component using the same allocation basis as when the convertible bonds were originally issued. Differences between the 

fair value and the carrying amount of the liability component will be recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the early 

redemption consideration and the fair value of the liability component will be included in equity (convertible bonds equity reserve) 

and released to retained profits.

Other financial liabilities

Other financial liabilities (including unsecured borrowings, trade and other payables, bills payable, trade payable to an associate, 

discounted bills with recourse, bank overdrafts and amounts due to subsidiaries) are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 

using the effective interest method.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date when a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 

remeasured to their fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 

immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition 

in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

Financial Instruments (continued)

Hedge accounting

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions for foreign currency exposure (cash 

flow hedges).

At the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the 

hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, 

at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 

hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.

Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised 

in other comprehensive income and accumulated in hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial guarantee contracts

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 

loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of 

a debt instrument. A financial guarantee contract issued by the Group and the Company and not designated as at fair value 

through profit or loss is recognised initially at its fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the 

financial guarantee contract. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group measures the financial guarantee contract at the higher 

of: (i) the amount of obligation under the contract, as determined in accordance with HKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 

and Contingent Assets; and (ii) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in 

accordance with the revenue recognition policy.

Derecognition

The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 

or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the 

Group and the Company neither transfer nor retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control 

the transferred asset, the Group and the Company continue to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement 

and recognises an associated liability. If the Group and the Company retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 

of a transferred financial asset, the Group and the Company continue to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a 

collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the 

consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income 

and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments (continued)

Derecognition (continued)

On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety, the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial 

asset between the part it continues to recognise, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair values of those 

parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised 

and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had 

been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised 

in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer 

recognised on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the relevant contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. The 

difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or 

loss.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 

that the Group and the Company will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 

the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end 

of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 

using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where 

the effect of the time value of money is material).

A provision for warranties is recognised at the time the products are sold based on the estimated cost using historical data for the 

level of repairs and replacements.

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position on condition that the Group has 

a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid expectation to those affected that the plan will be carried out, either by starting to 

implement that plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.

For a provision in relation to employee termination benefits, the liability and expenses are recognised when the Group committed 

to terminate the employment of an employee or group of employees before their normal retirement date or provide termination 

benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventories is calculated using the first-in, first-out 

method. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs 

necessary to make the sales.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue Recognition
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 

sold by the Group and the Company to outside customers in the normal course of business, less returns and allowances, and 

commission income and royalty income received.

Turnover from sales of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.

Commission income is recognised when services are provided.

Royalty income is recognised on a time proportion basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements.

Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 

amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 

and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment have been established.

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the 

consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s and the Company’s liability for current 

tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 

financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 

generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 

differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can 

be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or 

from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 

the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 

will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 

investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 

which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no 

longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 

settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 

reporting period.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Taxation (continued)
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which 

the Group and the Company expect, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 

liabilities. Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 

income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 

respectively.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 

income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or 

directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the 

tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

Foreign Currencies
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 

of that entity (foreign currencies) are recorded in its respective functional currency (i.e. the currency of the primary economic 

environment in which the entity operates) at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of 

each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates at that date. 

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognised in 

profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on a monetary item that form part of the 
Company’s net investment in a foreign operation, in which case, such exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive 

income and accumulated in equity and will be reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 

are translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. United States dollars) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end 

of each reporting period, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange 

differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of 

translation reserve (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 

of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate 

that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to 

the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not 

result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are reattributed 

to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates 

that do not result in the Group losing significant influence), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is 

reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 

January 1, 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at 

the end of the reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on acquisitions of foreign operations before 

January 1, 2005 are treated as non-monetary foreign currency items of the acquirer and reported using the historical exchange 

rate prevailing at the date of the acquisition.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2012

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 

necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets 

until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary 

investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for 

capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions
The fair value of services received determined by reference to the fair value of share options granted at the grant date is expensed 

on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation 

reserve).

At the end of each reporting period, the Group and the Company revise its estimates of the number of options that are expected 

to ultimately vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates during the vesting period, such that the cumulative 

expenses reflecting the revised estimate, is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to employee share-based 

compensation reserve.

At the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognised in employee share-based compensation 

reserve will be transferred to share premium. When the share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the 

amount previously recognised in the employee share-based compensation reserve will be transferred to retained profits.

Retirement Benefit Schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme are charged as 

expenses when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 

valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. All actuarial gains and losses of defined benefit plans are 

recognised immediately as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, including the 

unvested benefits, is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 

defined benefits liability or assets.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or 
surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any 

economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching 

to them and that the grants will be received. Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the 

periods in which the Group recognised as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Key Sources of Accounting Estimates

In the application of the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors of the 

Company are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that 

are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 

other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 

the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 

if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 

reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 

the next financial year.

Estimated Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value 

in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated.  The 

value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and 

a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. As at December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of goodwill and 

intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are approximately USD531,160,000 (2011: USD530,856,000) and approximately 

USD177,555,000 (2011: USD177,555,000) respectively. Details of the recoverable amount calculation are disclosed in Note 20.

Useful Lives and Estimated Impairment of Deferred Development Costs
As at December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of deferred development costs of the Group and the Company is USD182,571,000 

(2011: USD162,332,000) and USD5,909,000 (2011: USD14,708,000) respectively. The estimation of their useful lives impacts 
the level of annual amortisation recorded. The estimation of their useful lives reflects the directors’ best estimate of the periods 

that future economic benefits will be received through the use of the assets. In determining whether the deferred development 

costs are impaired, the management takes into consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the 

underlying projects, and the progress of these projects.  When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, 

a material loss may arise.  Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full.  This situation 

will be closely monitored, and adjustments will be made in future periods, if future market activity indicates that such adjustments 

are appropriate.

Useful Lives and Impairment Assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and identified impairment losses.  As at 
December 31, 2012, the Group’s and the Company’s carrying amount of property, plant and equipment are USD384,154,000 

(2011: USD360,082,000) and USD2,122,000 (2011: USD3,774,000) respectively.  The estimation of their useful lives impacts 

the level of annual depreciation expense recorded.  The estimated useful life that the Group and the Company place the 
equipment into production reflects the directors’ estimate of the periods that the Group and the Company intend to derive future 
economic benefits from the use of the Group’s and the Company’s property, plant and equipment.  Property, plant and equipment 

are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable. This process requires 
management’s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets.  For any instance where this evaluation 
process indicates impairment, the appropriate assets’ carrying values are written down to the recoverable amount and the amount 

of the write-down is charged against the results of operations.

Key Sources of Accounting Estimates (continued)

Income Taxes
As at December 31, 2012, a deferred tax asset of approximately USD53,704,000 (2011: USD57,095,000) in relation to 

unused tax losses and approximately USD25,242,000 (2011: USD11,257,000) in relation to employee related provisions has 
been recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.  The realisability of the deferred tax asset mainly 

depends on whether sufficient taxable profits, or taxable temporary differences, will be available in the future.  In cases where 

the actual future taxable profits generated are less than expected, a material reversal of the deferred tax assets may arise, which 

would be recognised in profit or loss for the period in which such a reversal takes place. During the year, deferred tax assets of 

approximately USD10,109,000 (2011: USD15,850,000) in relation to unused tax losses were utilised.

Estimated Impairment of Trade and Other Receivables, Bills Receivable and Trade Receivables from Associates
When there is objective evidence of an impairment loss, the Group and the Company takes into consideration the estimation of 
future cash flows.  The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 

the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the 
financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition).  When the actual 
future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.  As at December 31, 2012, the Group’s and the 
Company’s carrying amount of trade and other receivables, bills receivable and trade receivables/amounts due from associates is 

USD755,337,000 (net of allowance for doubtful debts of USD13,987,000) (2011: USD728,781,000 (net of allowance for doubtful 

debts of USD14,680,000)) and USD24,441,000 (net of allowance for doubtful debts of nil) (2011: USD29,625,000 (net of 

allowance for doubtful debts of nil)).

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 3. Segment 

profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of the share of results of associates and finance costs. This 
is the measure reported to the Group’s executive directors, for the purposes of resource allocation and performance assessment.

The Group allocates fair value changes in warrants, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts and interest earned 

on bank deposits to segment results, whereas the related warrants, interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and 

bank balances, deposits and cash are not allocated to the segment assets.

The retailer and service relationships were acquired through business combinations which related to the relationships with retailers 

and service centres.

Deferred development costs are internally generated.

Included in trademarks of the Group, USD177,555,000 (2011: USD177,555,000) are trademarks with an indefinite useful life, 

considered by the management of the Group as having an indefinite useful life because they are expected to contribute to net 

cash inflows indefinitely. The trademarks will not be amortised until their useful life is determined to be finite. Instead they will be 

tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Particulars of the impairment testing 

are disclosed in Note 20.

The above intangible assets, other than trademarks with indefinite useful lives, are amortised on a straight-line basis, at the

Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives

As explained in Note 5, the Group uses the types of good sold for operating segment information. For the purpose of impairment 

testing, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives set out in Notes 18 and 19 have been allocated to five major individual 

cash generating units (CGUs), including four units in the Power Equipment segment and one unit in the Floor Care and Appliances 

segment. The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks as at December 31, 2012 allocated to these units are as follows:

Power Equipment – MET

Power Equipment – HCP

Power Equipment – Drebo

Power Equipment – Baja

Floor Care and Appliances – RAM/Hoover/VAX

No goodwill and trademarks impairment have been recognised for the year ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

The basis of the recoverable amounts of the above CGUs and their major underlying assumptions are summarised below:

Power Equipment – MET (“MET”)
The recoverable amount of MET has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 

projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period and a discount rate of 11.5% 

(2011: 10.7%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for MET are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 

sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimation are based on 
MET’s past performance, management’s expectation for the market development, the success in reducing the working capital 

requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategy implemented by the Group. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year 

period are extrapolated using a steady 3.0% (2011: 3.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change 

in any of these assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount of MET to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount 

of MET.

20. 

Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives (continued)

Power Equipment – HCP (“HCP”)
The recoverable amount of HCP has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 

projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 12.0% 

(2011: 11.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for HCP are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimation are based on HCP’s 
past performance, management’s expectation for the market development, the success in new products launched and the success 

of the cost cutting strategy implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering 

any growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the 

aggregate carrying amount of HCP to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of HCP.

Power Equipment – Drebo (“Drebo”)
The recoverable amount of Drebo has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 

projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 11.0% 

(2011: 11.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Drebo are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimation are based on Drebo’s 
past performance, management’s expectation for the market development, the success in new products launched and the cost 

cutting strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth 

rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the aggregate 

carrying amount of Drebo to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of Drebo.

Power Equipment – Baja (“Baja”)
The recoverable amount of Baja has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 

projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 13.0% 

(2011: 16.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Baja are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 

sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimation are based on 
Baja’s past performance, management’s expectation for the market development and the success of the cost cutting strategy 

implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2011: 3.0%) growth rate. 

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying 

amount of Baja to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of Baja.

Floor Care and Appliances – RAM/Hoover/VAX (“RAM/Hoover/VAX”)
The recoverable amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash 

flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 15.3% 

(2011: 13.8%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for RAM/Hoover/VAX are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows 

including sales, gross margin, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The assumptions 
and estimation are based on RAM/Hoover/VAX’s past performance, management’s expectation for the market development, 

the success in reducing the working capital requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategies implemented. Cash 

flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth rate. Management believes that any 

reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX to 

exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX.

With the change in management of the Floor Care and Appliances CGU, VAX was aggregated to this CGU as at 

December 31, 2012.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit 

quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly. Trade receivables 

that are neither past due nor impaired have the best credit scoring attributable under the internal credit scoring system used by 

the Group.

Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of USD16,144,000 (2011: USD19,806,000) 

which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for impairment loss.  The Group does not hold any 

collateral over these balances.  The average age of these receivables is 243 days (2011: 247 days).

The Group has a policy of allowing credit periods ranging from 60 days to 120 days. Trade receivables that were past due but not 

provided for impairment loss are related to a number of independent customers that have a good track record with the Group. The 

management believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of these balances as there has not been a significant 

change in credit quality and the balances are still considered fully recoverable.

Under certain receivables purchase agreements, a percentage in various pools of trade receivables were factored to banks 
(the “Factored Trade Receivables”). As the Group still retained the risks associated in respect of default payments, the Group 

continued to recognise the Factored Trade Receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position. At the end of the 

reporting period, proceeds from the Factored Trade Receivables of approximately USD75,000,000 (2011: USD71,800,000) were 
recognised as liabilities and included in “Unsecured borrowings – due within one year” in the consolidated statement of financial 

position.

The Group and the Company hold approximately 20 per cent of the voting power in the equity securities of a company listed in 

the US but it has no significant influence over the investee. In making their assessment, the directors considered the definition of 

significant influence in HKAS 28 Investment in Associates and, in particular, whether the Group has the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Considering that the Group has no representative on the investee’s board 

of directors and no right to appoint or remove a director to the board of directors, no exchange of management personnel with the 
investee nor any participation in the investee’s policy-making process, the directors of the Company concluded that the Group and 

the Company have no significant influence over the investee.

31.  Bank Balances, Deposits and Cash/Bank Overdrafts

Bank balances carry interest at market rates which range from 0.10% to 0.27% (2011: 0.07% to 0.18%). Bank overdrafts carry

39.  Capital Risk Management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged 

from prior years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (which includes borrowings, discounted bills with recourse, convertible 

bonds and obligations under finance leases), net of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to owners of the Company, 

comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained profits.

Gearing ratio
The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the management considers 

the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a target gearing ratio of not exceeding 35% 

determined as the proportion of net debt to equity. The Group will continue to execute very disciplined control and management of 

its working capital and generate free cash inflows through the growth of the business.

The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:

(ii) 

Equity includes all capital and reserves attributable to the owners of the Company.

In addition, based on management recommendations, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of 

dividends, new share issues and share repurchases as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

For the year ended December 31, 2012

40.  Financial Instruments (continued)

40.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group’s corporate treasury function provides risk management advice to the business units, co-ordinates access to 

domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the 

Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These financial risks include 

market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments or natural hedges to mitigate 
these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, 

which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives 

and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies is reviewed by 

the internal auditors on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for 

speculative purposes.

40.2.1 Foreign Currency Risk Management

Subsidiaries of the Group have foreign currency sales and purchases, which expose the Group to foreign currency risk. 
Approximately 24.5% (2011: 24.5%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional 

currency of the group entity making the sale, whilst almost 38.2% (2011: 38.5%) of purchase are denominated in the 
group entity’s respective functional currency.

The carrying amounts of certain significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at 

the reporting date are as follows:

Note:  For group entities with their functional currency as the United States dollar, monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in Hong Kong 

dollars have no material foreign currency risk exposure as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged with the United States dollar.

The Group requires its group entities to use foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the currency exposures. 

The foreign exchange forward contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. On this basis, the Group 

has entered into such forward contracts in relation to the foreign currency denominated monetary liabilities amounting 
to USD108,826,000 (2011: Nil). It is the Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the 

terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness (see Note 29 for details).

40.2.1 Foreign Currency Risk Management (continued)

Sensitivity analysis

The Group and the Company are mainly exposed to the effects of fluctuation in the EURO.

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the United States dollar against 

the EURO without considering the foreign currency forward contracts entered at the end of the reporting period. 5% is 

the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis 

includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and excludes the effect of any foreign currency 

forward contracts held at year end. A positive number below indicates an increase in pre-tax profit for the year where 

the United States dollar weakens 5% against the EURO.

This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on receivables and payables denominated in EURO at the year end.

40.2.2 Interest Rate Risk Management

The Group’s and the Company’s cash flow interest rate risk relates primarily to variable-rate borrowing (see Note 41 

for details of these borrowings), discounted bills with recourse, bank overdrafts and bank balances, deposits and 

cash. In relation to these floating-rate borrowings, the Group aims at keeping certain borrowings at fixed rates. In order 

to achieve this result, the Group may enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against part of its exposure to 

potential variability of cash flows arising from changes in floating rates (see Note 29 for details). The management 

continuously monitors interest rate fluctuations and will consider further hedging interest rate risk should the need 

arise.

The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed 
in the liquidity risk management section of this note. The Group’s and the Company’s cash flow interest rate risk is 
mainly concentrated on the fluctuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) arising from the Group’s and the 
Company’s Hong Kong dollar denominated borrowings. In relation to interest bearing bank balances and deposits, the 

Group considers the interest rate risk is insignificance.

The Group’s fair value interest rate risk related primarily to its fixed-rate bank borrowings (see Note 41 for details of 
these borrowings). The Company’s fair value interest rate risk related primarily to its loan to subsidiaries (see Note 21).

During the year, the Group obtained new bank borrowings in the amount of USD793 million (2011: USD352 million) 
which are either LIBOR or Hong Kong best lending rates based. The proceeds were used for refinancing of the Group’s 

borrowings including the repayment of fixed interest rate notes of USD30,000,000 and other borrowings.

For the year ended December 31, 2012

40.  Financial Instruments (continued)

40.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

40.2.2 Interest Rate Risk Management (continued)

Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative 

instruments. The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period 

was outstanding for the whole year without considering the interest rate swaps entered at the end of the reporting 

period. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit 

for the year ended December 31, 2012 would decrease/increase by USD4,765,000 (2011: decrease/increase 
by USD4,831,000). The Company’s profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 would decrease/increase by 
USD1,859,000 (2011: decrease/increase by USD1,719,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s and the 
Company’s exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate borrowings.

The Group’s and the Company’s sensitivity to interest rates has decreased and increased during the current period 

mainly due to the decrease and increase in variable rate debt instruments respectively.

40.2.3 Other Price Risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to price risk through its held-for-trading investments and derivative financial 

instruments.

Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to price risks of equity investments 

held-for-trading measured at fair value at the reporting date.

If the prices of the respective equity instruments had been 10% higher/lower the post-tax profit for the year ended 

December 31, 2012 of the Group and the Company would increase/decrease by USD598,000 (2011: USD829,000) 

and USD598,000 (2011: USD829,000) as a result of the changes in fair value of held-for-trading investments.

No sensitivity analysis has been disclosed for exposure to the price risk for the warrants held by the Group and the 

Company as this would not have a material impact on post-tax profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the 

Group and the Company.

40.2.4 Credit Risk Management

As at December 31, 2012, the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a 

financial loss to the Group and the Company due to failure to discharge an obligation by the counterparties and 

financial guarantees provided by the Group and the Company is arising from:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the statements of financial position; 

and

the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to financial guarantees issued by the Group and the Company as 

disclosed in Note 49.

40.  Financial Instruments (continued)

40.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

40.2.4 Credit risk Management (continued)

In order to minimise the credit risk, the management has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit 

limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue 

debts. In addition, the Group and the Company review the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt and 

debt investments at each balance sheet date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable 
amounts. In this regard, the directors of the Company consider that the Group’s and the Company’s credit risk is 

significantly reduced.

The credit risk on liquid fund is limited because the counterparties are banks with good reputation.

The Group’s concentration of credit risk by geographical locations is mainly in North America, where 65.7% 

(2011: 66.7%) of the total trade receivables as at December 31, 2012 are located.

The Group has concentration of credit risk at 23.7% (2011: 25.9%) and 36.8% (2011: 41.3%) of the total trade 
receivables were due from the Group’s largest customer and the five largest customers respectively.

40.2.5 Liquidity Risk Management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors which has built an appropriate 
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and 

liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking 

facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the 

maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

As at December 31, 2012, the Group has available unutilised overdrafts and short and medium term bank loan 

facilities of approximately USD65 million (2011: USD73 million) and USD1,290 million (2011: USD1,161 million) 

respectively.

Liquidity tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities as well 

as non-derivative financial assets which are included in the maturity analysis. For non-derivative financial assets, the 

tables have been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the undiscounted cash flow of the financial assets 

unless specified separately. For non-derivative financial liabilities, the tables reflect the undiscounted cash flow of 

financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both 

interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that the interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is 

derived from the interest rate curve at the end of the reporting period. The inclusion of information on non-derivative 
financial assets is necessary in order to understand the Group’s liquidity risk management as the liquidity is managed 

on a net asset and liability basis.

40.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

40.2.5 Liquidity Risk Management (continued)

Liquidity tables (continued)
In addition, the following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The tables 

have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual net cash (inflows) and outflows on derivative instruments 

that settle on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross (inflows) and outflows on those derivatives that require gross 

settlement. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the 
foreign currency exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The liquidity analysis for the Group’s 

derivative financial instruments are prepared based on the contractual maturities as the management consider that the 

contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.

Note:  Maturities are based on the management’s estimation of the expected realisation of these financial assets.

The amounts included above for financial guarantee contracts are the maximum amounts the Group and the Company 

could be required to settle under the arrangement for the full guaranteed amount if that amount is claimed by the 

counterparty to the guarantee. Based on expectations at the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company 

considers that it is more likely than not that no amount will be payable under the arrangement. However, this estimate 

is subject to change depending on the probability of the counterparty claiming under guarantee which is a function of 

the likelihood that the financial receivables held by the counterparty which are guaranteed suffer credit losses.

The amount included above for variable interest rate instruments for non-derivative financial liabilities is subject to 

change if changes in variable interest rates differ to those estimates of interest rate determined at the end of the 

reporting period.

40.3  Fair Value

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield 

curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contract;

the fair value of the interest rate swap is measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted 

based on the applicable yield curves derived from noted interest rate;

the fair value of the warrants is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model where the main assumptions 

include the volatility of the share price and the life of the warrants;

the fair value of financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are 

determined with reference to quoted market bid prices; and

the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined 

in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from 

observable current market transactions.

Other than the convertible bonds, the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised costs 

approximate to their carrying amounts.

Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments that are 

measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 

assets or liabilities;

Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that 

are observable for the asset or, liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or 

liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

40.4  Transfer of financial assets

The following were the Group’s financial assets as at December 31, 2012 that were transferred to banks by discounting 

those receivables on a full recourse basis. As the Group has not transferred the significant risks and rewards relating to 

these receivables, it continues to recognise the full carrying amount of the receivables and has recognised the cash received 

on the transfer as discounted bills with recourse (see Note 38). These financial assets are carried at amortised cost in the 
Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.

The bills receivable discounted with banks with full recourse at the year end was as follows:

Carrying amount of associated liabilities

Note: 

In 2003, the Group issued fixed interest rate notes, through its wholly-owned subsidiary in the US, for an aggregate principal amount of USD145,000,000. The 

notes were issued in two fixed rate tranches, being USD120,000,000 for 10 years at 6.70% per annum and USD25,000,000 for 7 years at 6.09% per annum. 

The proceeds were used to refinance existing medium term debts and for general working capital purposes. During the year, the Group repaid nil 

(2011: USD5,625,000) of the first tranche and USD25,000,000 of the second tranche was fully repaid in 2010.

In 2005, the Group issued additional fixed interest rate notes, through its wholly-owned subsidiary in the US, for an aggregate principal amount of 

USD200,000,000. The notes were issued in two fixed rate tranches of USD150,000,000 for 10 years at 7.44% per annum and USD50,000,000 for 7 years at 

7.17% per annum. The proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of subsidiaries. During the year, the Group repaid USD30,000,000 of the second tranche 

and the second tranche was then fully repaid.

The carrying amount of bank borrowings approximates their fair value as the weighted average interest rates approximate the 

contracted market rates.

The fair value of the liability component of the convertible bonds at December 31, 2011, determined based on the present 

value of the estimated future cash outflows discounted at the prevailing market rate at the end of the reporting period date, was 

approximately USD156,401,000.

In 2009, the Company issued two tranches of 5-year 8.5% coupon convertible bonds with an aggregate principal amount of 
USD150,000,000 (“Convertible Bonds 2014”) and 55,888,500 detachable warrants (“Warrants 2012”). Unless previously 

redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds 2014 will be redeemed at their principal amount on the 

maturity date at April 30, 2014.

The holders of the Convertible Bonds 2014 have the right to convert all or any portion of the Convertible Bonds 2014 into shares 

of the Company at an initial conversion price of HKD5.20 (to be converted to United States dollars at the fixed exchange rate 
of HKD7.75 = USD1.0) per share, subject to anti-dilutive adjustment, from October 30, 2010 to April 20, 2014 (“Conversion 
Rights”). The conversion will result in the Company issuing a fixed number of shares of the Company in settlement of a fixed 

amount of cash.

At the option of the Convertible Bond 2014’s holders, on April 30, 2012, the holders could redeem Convertible Bond 2014 at the 

principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. Accordingly, the Convertible Bond 2014 is classified as current 

liabilities as of December 31, 2011.

The fair value of the liability component on initial recognition was estimated at the issue date using an equivalent market interest 

rate for a similar bond without the Conversion Rights and Warrants 2012. The residual amount was assigned as the equity 

component, representing the estimated fair value of the Warrants 2012 with the remaining balance is allocated to the Conversion 
Rights and included in shareholders’ equity.

The weighted average effective interest rate of the Convertible Bonds 2014 is 15.57%.

During the year, all the Convertible Bonds 2014 were converted into 223,557,689 shares of the Company at HKD5.20 per share.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the year ended December 31, 2012

45.  Retirement Benefit Obligations

Defined Contribution Plans:
The Company and its subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong have participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (“MPF 
Schemes”) registered under the Mandatory Provident Fund Ordinance since December 2000. The assets of the MPF Schemes are 

held separately from those of the Group, in funds under the control of trustees. The Group contributes 5% of relevant payroll cost 

to the MPF Schemes with maximum amount of HKD13,750 (2011: HKD12,000) per employee per annum, which contribution is 

matched by the employee.

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the PRC are members of a state-managed retirement benefit scheme operated by 

the PRC government. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit 

scheme to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the 

specified contributions.

The Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution 
schemes applicable to each year are made at a certain percentage of the employees’ payroll.

Defined Benefits Plans:
The Group operates several defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Germany and the US, of which 

these plans cover substantially all remaining employees that are not covered by defined contribution plans. The major defined 

benefit plans are as follows:

Pension plan obligations (Note i)

Post-retirement medical and dental plan obligations (Note ii)

Life and medical insurance plan (Note ii)

Post-employment benefit plan obligations (Note iii)

The share options are vested in parts over 3 years from the date of grant.

Expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 

exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the volatility of the share 
price. Because changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the directors’ opinion, the 

existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the share options.

The weighted average closing prices of shares immediately before the options grant date during 2012 and 2011 were HKD8.65 

and HKD9.70 respectively.

The closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before date of grant was HKD8.65 in 2012 and ranged from HKD7.30 to 

HKD10.04 in 2011.

The weighted average closing prices of the Company’s shares immediately before various dates during 2012 and 2011 on which 

the share options were exercised were HKD14.12 and HKD10.10 respectively.

The Group recognised a total expense of USD578,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 (2011: USD1,053,000) in relation 

to share options granted by the Company.

The fair values of the share options granted in 2012 and 2011 measured at date of grant was HKD2.11 and ranged from HKD1.92 

to HKD2.58 per option respectively. The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in 2011 was HKD2.40 per 

option.

The Company had 16,281,000 share options outstanding, which represented approximately 0.89% of the issued share capital of 

the Company as at December 31, 2012. No option was cancelled during the year.
