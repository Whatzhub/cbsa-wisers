Chairman’s Statement

“ I am proud to report that TTI had a 
strong year of financial performance 
with record profits delivering  
a decade of consecutive annual 
revenue growth.”

I am pleased to announce our 2019 performance achieved record 
profits marking a decade of revenue growth. We built on our strong 
first half performance by delivering record second half results,  
driven by the development of new products and expansion across 
all categories, verticals and geographies.

Gross margin, EBIT, and net profit outpaced our impressive topline 
growth. TTI enters 2020 with a formidable record of industry leading 
performance, focused on our strategic drivers of powerful brands, 
innovative products, leading edge technology, exceptional people, 
and operational excellence.

Solid Corporate Performance
TTI reported sales of US$7.7 billion, an increase of 9.2% over 2018 
and 10.7% growth in local currency. The defining force behind our 
sustained success is our cordless leadership strategy. We continue  
to expand our cordless product families by further investing in our 
core lithium battery platforms, driving cutting-edge brushless motor 
technology and developing state-of-the art electronics and power 
management systems. The result is a flow of new products with 
demonstrable end-user benefits. Our flagship Power Equipment 
business, representing 88.6% of total sales, grew 13.0% to  
US$6.8 billion. Driving this stellar performance is our Milwaukee  
Tool business with another year of impressive performance of 21.7% 
growth in local currency while the RYOBI ONE+ business generated  
a high single digit sales increase. We continued to make progress in 

the Floor Care and Appliance business with the strategic cordless  
and carpet washing categories up 18.9% over 2018. The overall  
Floor Care business declined 13.5%, however EBIT improved 12.8% 
as we strengthened the division by exiting certain European markets 
and discontinuing non-strategic legacy categories. Despite the sales 
decline, we are very encouraged with the performance of our cordless 
and carpet washing categories, which have both been well received  
by the market and have delivered significant growth.

TTI continued to consolidate and strengthen its position in North America  
delivering industry leading growth of over 10.2% while EMEA grew  
an outstanding 13.5% in local currency. Our selective geographic 
expansion into targeted under-represented markets is progressing  
with successes in key markets in the Nordic and Eastern European 
arena. In rest of world, Australia and our Asia businesses again 
produced another excellent year with above market growth at 10.0% 
in local currency.

Continuing Operational Excellence
Our flow of high margin new products, mix management, productivity 
gains and volume leverage helped drive the gross margin up for  
the 11th successive year. Gross margin expanded from 37.2% in 
2018 to 37.7% in 2019. We maintained a relentless focus on 
operational excellence through the TTI OPEX System, generating 
efficiencies throughout our operations and expanding the supply 
chain beyond the traditional base. To support our rapid growth,  

8

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019

we have made investments to expand our global manufacturing 
footprint in Asia, Mexico and the USA. Our manufacturing operation 
in Vietnam which has expanded rapidly over the last year has now 
become a strategically important part of our global manufacturing 
operations. These initiatives are delivering world-class service levels, 
high quality products, while helping us mitigate headwinds, including 
tariffs, and positioning TTI for future growth. 

Delivering Financial Performance 
EBIT increased 10.9% to US$673 million, with the EBIT margin 
improving by 10 basis points to 8.8%. Shareholders’ profits rose 
11.3% to US$615 million, with earnings per share increasing 11.6% 
over 2018 to US33.67 cents. Through our disciplined working capital 
management, we delivered a gearing of 0.5% and working capital  
as 14.3% of sales.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of HK58.00 cents 
(approximately US7.46 cents) per share. Together, with the interim 
dividend of HK45.00 cents (approximately US5.79 cents) per share, 
this will result in a full-year dividend of HK103.00 cents (approximately 
US13.26 cents) per share, against HK88.00 cents (approximately 
US11.33 cents) per share in 2018, an increase of 17.0%.

High-Performance Strategy
A core foundation for our continued success has been an uninterrupted 
strategic focus on cordless technology over the years. We have 
remained dedicated to the four strategic pillars of Powerful Brands, 
Innovative Products, Exceptional People and Operational Excellence 
that have allowed us to concentrate on building an organization  
that delivers sustained performance, growth and profitability.  
TTI has followed its cordless leadership strategy in prioritizing  
the development of the cordless technologies necessary to bring 
revolutionary and ergonomic products to our end-users. We are 
leveraging our global product development resources and enhancing 
our well established power tool battery platforms for MILWAUKEE  
and RYOBI that are the most extensive in the industry as well as our 
newly launched battery platform for our floor care business. We see  
a bright future as we pursue the expansion of our cordless technology 
into new product categories. 

We have identified new targets which are in line with our product 
development. An exciting and revolutionary development is the 
launch of the industrial MILWAUKEE MX FUEL Equipment system. 
The system is the result of extensive research and development into 
the industrial construction and maintenance equipment industries. 
This new groundbreaking cordless system is the platform that 
provides the technology and capability for Milwaukee Tool to step  
into the light equipment space.

Strong Outlook
TTI has an enviable track record of organically growing the top and 
bottom lines faster than our competitors. Looking forward, we have 
outlined strategic targets for expanding the product families around 
our leading MILWAUKEE and RYOBI battery platforms, entering new 
vertical markets and selective geographic expansion which create 
exciting opportunities for continued, above-market, sustained growth. 
These targets are aligned with our investments in R&D, strategic 
SG&A and new product development teams to continue delivering  
a flow of technically advanced innovative products that are 
fundamentally changing the way our users work at home and on  
the jobsite.

The Coronavirus is a global concern and with the situation as it 
currently stands today, we believe that we are well positioned given 
our diversified manufacturing base and supply chain to deal with the 
challenges that may present themselves and we are confident we will 
be able to deliver a solid 2020.

TTI remains committed to our strategic initiative of expanding our 
cordless leadership. One of the key factors is TTI OPEX which 
supports our world class product development system, drives deep 
management discipline and financial rigor. TTI is highly focused on 
further developing our world-class organization and has a pool of 
talent progressing through our Leadership Development Program.  
We are dedicated to stringent governance practices, sustainability 
and to increasing our positive impact on the environment.

I would like to thank our loyal customers, suppliers, shareholders, 
Board and entire TTI organization for another outstanding year.  
Our dedicated, skilled and passionate teams across the globe are 
enabling us to continuously achieve outstanding results. It is our 
unrelenting bold vision, customer focus and business momentum 
that will make 2020 another successful year and position TTI with 
exciting opportunities in the decade to come.

Floor Care and Appliances

In 2019, the Floor Care  
and Appliance business  
made outstanding progress 
developing the categories  
of Cordless cleaning and 
Carpet Washers.

The transition has resulted in 18.9% growth in these categories 
year-over-year making a significant contribution to the overall 
business. We have been disciplined in transitioning our floor  
care business from dated legacy corded floor care products to 
high-performance cordless and newly engineered state-of-the-art 
carpet washers. The floor care and appliance sales decline of  
13.5% from prior year was a result of our successful strategic exit  
of the German floor care business while improving our profitability  
in the segment. The disciplined expansion of in-house manufacturing 
for our strategic categories in cordless cleaning and carpet washing 
products to the US and Vietnam has been a great success.

as compared to US$2,014 million in 2018, representing 29.1% of 
turnover (2018: 28.7%). The increase was mainly due to the strategic 
investments in new products and promotional activities to maintain  
the sales growth momentum and continual margin improvements.

Liquidity and Financial Resources

Shareholders’ Funds

Long term borrowings accounted for 52.9% of total debts (2018: 56.0%).

The Group’s major borrowings continued to be in US Dollars. 
Borrowings are predominantly LIBOR based. There is a natural  
hedge mechanism in place as the Group’s major revenues are in  
US Dollars and currency exposure therefore is low. Currency, interest 
rate exposures, and cash management functions are all being closely 
monitored and managed by the Group’s treasury team.

Amongst the bank borrowings, fixed rate debts account for 12.6%  
of the total bank borrowings, the balance being floating rate debts.

Working Capital

Total inventory was at US$2,113 million as compared to US$1,767 million 
in 2018. Days inventory increased by 9 days from 92 days to 101 days. 
The higher inventory days as compared to past years was mainly due 
to the strategic decision to carry a higher level of inventory to support 
our service level, considering our high growth momentum and to 
mitigate tariffs impact. The Group will continue to focus in managing 
the inventory level and improve inventory turns.

Trade receivable turnover days were at 55 days as compared to 57 days 
last year. Excluding the gross up of the receivables factored which is 
without recourse in nature, receivable turnover days were at 52 days 
as compared to 53 days last year. The Group is comfortable with the 
quality of the receivables and will continue to exercise due care in 
managing the credit exposure.

Total shareholders’ funds amounted to US$3.4 billion as compared  
to US$3.1 billion in 2018. Book value per share was at US$1.85 as 
compared to US$1.67 last year, an increase of 10.8%.

Trade payable days were 104 days as compared to 100 days in 2018 
as the Group managed to leverage the volume and order visibility for 
better trade terms from suppliers.

Financial Position

The Group continued to maintain a strong financial position.  
As at December 31, 2019, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents 
amounted to US$1,412 million (2018: US$1,104 million), of which 
44.6%, 28.6%, 9.4% and 17.4% were denominated in US$, RMB, 
EUR and other currencies respectively.

The Group’s net gearing, expressed as a percentage of total net 
borrowing (excluding bank advance from factored trade receivables 
which are without recourse in nature) to equity attributable to Owners  
of the Company, was at 0.5% as compared to net cash in 2018.  
The Group remains confident that gearing will remain low going forward.

Working capital as a percentage of sales was at 14.3% as compared 
to 13.3% in 2018.

The Remuneration Committee reviewed and recommended to the 
Board for approval the 2019 incentive payouts for the Chairman, 
the CEO and other Executive Directors commensurate with the 
exceptional performance delivered by the Group.

As noted in the 2018 Annual Report, the Board approved multi-year 
performance-based share awards to Mr Galli (“CEO Share Awards”)

performance criteria (“Performance Criteria”) over the period 2019 to

meeting the Performance Criteria each year. Under the terms of the 
CEO Share Awards, Mr Galli delivered exceptional performance in 
2019 and was awarded one million shares on January 3, 2020 for 
the Company’s share price and operational performance over the 
three-year period ending in 2019 (“2019 Award”). These shares are 
scheduled to vest to Mr Galli on January 1, 2025. The remainder of 
the CEO Share Awards (up to four million shares) will be awarded 
subject to the Company’s future performance meeting the goals  
set out in the CEO Share Awards plan from 2020 to 2023. The  
2019 Award was made under the 2018 Share Award Scheme.

2018 Share Award Scheme are substantially identical and below are 
the summary of the principal terms of both schemes:

Any employee or Director (including, without limitation, any 
Executive, Non-executive or Independent Non-executive Director) of 
any member of the Group (the “Eligible Person”) will be entitled to 
participate the schemes. Unless terminated earlier by the Board in 
accordance with the respective scheme rules, the effective term of 
each scheme is 10 years commencing on the adoption date of the 
relevant scheme provided that no contribution to the trust will be 
made by the Company on or after the 10th anniversary date of the 
adoption date of the relevant scheme. Details of both schemes were

the schemes.

The Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select 
any Eligible Person for participation in any scheme as a selected 
grantee (the “Selected Grantee”) and determine the number of 
shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount.  
The relevant number of shares awarded will be purchased by 
the trustee of the schemes from the market or new shares will be 
subscribed for by the trustee at the cost of the Company and be held 
in trust until they are vested. When the Selected Grantee has satisfied 
all vesting conditions specified by the Board, the trustee will transfer 
the relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom 
(net of accrued interest) to the Selected Grantee.

“ Sustainability is a big deal. With our no emission  

cordless leadership strategy, we are helping

We are accelerating our actions to further our global commitment 
to sustainability. TTI is reshaping sustainability into a core competence 
by embracing best environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
practices. Our sustainability principles and practices extend throughout 
our operations, supply chain and products with priorities to responsibly 
source, conserve, reuse and recycle resources, provide safe respectful 
workplaces and always be in compliance with applicable laws and 
policies. We have long taken responsibility to improve the lives of  
our customers by disrupting the power tool, outdoor product and 
floorcare markets with reduced environmental impact Lithium cordless

economic, social and environmental aims are all interrelated and 
firmly believes that our ability to grow, innovate and prosper is linked 
to our ESG performance. TTI’s core strategic drivers and culture are 
closely aligned with our ESG practices and standards to ensure that 
sustainability is firmly entrenched at all levels of our value chain.

Commitment to Global Initiatives
Recognizing the importance of adopting a comprehensive international 
and independent standard to understand and communicate our 
impact on global issues such as climate change, human rights and 
anti-corruption, in 2019 TTI became a member of the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative (RMI) and actively began working towards becoming 
a Community Member of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  
in January 2020.

Our commitment to global action on sustainability was also 
strengthened in aligning our strategy with the United Nations (UN) 
Global Compact’s universal principles on human rights, labor, 
environment and anti-corruption, and the advancement of societal goals. 
By supporting 14 of the 17 UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
most relevant to TTI’s business, we have outlined a strategic roadmap 
for TTI to follow to further our sustainability performance.

Confidently Moving Forward
I am confident that our adoption of enhanced data management 
tools, more robust procurement mechanisms and our commitment  
to global initiatives and principles will help us manage risks and 
opportunities in the ESG arena to achieve our targets in the short to 
medium term with a view towards longer-term success. I would like  
to thank all the TTI team members for their dedication and hard work 
to make sustainability a powerful thrust of the TTI culture. We look 
forward to working with all our stakeholders to create sustainable 
value and to build a better world for all. At TTI, we strongly believe 
that cordless technology is helping us all along this journey.

Sustainability Improvements
Now in our fifth year of reporting on sustainability separately in  
our annual report, I am very pleased to state that we continue to 
strengthen managing ESG issues that are directly linked to our 
activities and products. Under the management of our ESG Executive 
and Working Committees, we have made significant strides in 
improving our sustainability performance both internally and in 
engagements with all our stakeholders. In 2019, we implemented 
and strengthened the important initiatives shared in this report  
to further our sustainability strategy.

Enhanced Data Management: Greenstone
With the understanding that increased transparency is key to 
improving ESG performance, in 2019 TTI partnered with software 
data specialists to collect, analyze and better manage our ESG data. 
This allows us to greatly enhance the quality of our oversight and 
extend the breadth and credibility of our disclosures to meet the 
expectations of stakeholders, including investors.

Cobalt Procurement Policy
The newly-implemented TTI Cobalt Procurement Policy signifies our 
ongoing effort to do the right thing across our value chain. This policy 
outlines the standards that TTI and its suppliers must follow to ensure 
that all cobalt is from reputable sources, free from conflict or other 
human rights violations.

Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality
At TTI, we believe that aligning our long-term interests with  
those of our stakeholders is the path to corporate sustainability  
and a more sustainable world. Employees, customers, suppliers, 
investors and the broader community are our key stakeholder groups. 
We maintain regular communication with regulatory authorities, 
business partners, customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, 

investors and community members to understand their priorities  
and sustainability-related concerns. Our ESG Working Committee  
has identified a number of material issues, which we believe are  
of utmost importance to our stakeholders. The table below identifies  
our key stakeholders, their main areas of interest that inform the 
content of our reporting, and the ways that we engage with them.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Our Strategic Approach to Sustainability
To enhance our sustainability performance and transparency, TTI has 
engaged in a number of global initiatives, one of these involves working 
towards meeting the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for 
sustainability reporting. In 2019 we engaged with GRI to discuss the 
scope of our membership and became a member in January 2020. 
As a member, TTI will have access to a variety of sustainability 
resources such as webinars with experts from GRI and the opportunity 

to exchange information with leaders from the corporate world who 
are championing sustainability reporting. By joining this global 
community of more than 500 organizations that are committed to 
sustainability, TTI will be able to contribute to improving the quality  
of reporting. One of TTI’s key priorities in joining GRI is to be part  
of the leadership committee on supply chain and in particular, the 
modern slavery committee to enhance sustainable practices across

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportOverview
Good corporate governance is material to the long-term health of our 
company as it allows us to achieve our objectives, driving growth and 
positive change while our Exceptional People continually maintain 
high legal and ethical standards in all aspects of our business. TTI’s 
governance strategy is implemented through codes and policies that 
set requirements and emphasize accountability and responsibility  
to maintain Operational Excellence throughout our business.   
Our performance is continually evaluated by a number of mechanisms 
including an independent compliance hotline, internal audit 
investigations and ongoing compliance monitoring to ensure that our 
processes of disclosure and transparency are effectively maintained.

Each business unit across TTI develops its own implementation plan 
and KPIs based upon local needs as per the medium – and long-term 
strategies developed by the ESG Working Committee. This exercise 
entails the review of performance on an annual basis against the KPIs 
that are set at the beginning of each financial year. In 2019, the Board 
endorsed TTI’s ESG strategy. Our CEO requested regular updates on 
sustainability initiatives and results from all business units, which  
were presented to management across the group at the year-end of 
2019. The ESG Working Committee’s annual meeting was postponed 
due to social unrest in Hong Kong in 2019, but the Committee 
conducted its business through three conference calls for this period 
as a result.

TTI’s global strategy is aligned with key SDGs. In our pursuit of  
good governance, we promote inclusive societies and strive to  
build accessible, effective and accountable channels for engaging 
our stakeholders. We also play a part in strengthening the global 
partnership for sustainable development by participating in effective 
multi-stakeholder partnerships across markets where we operate.

Governance Structure
TTI’s principles of good governance form a solid foundation from 
which we make progress toward our targets and build stakeholders’ 
confidence in our performance. The codes and policies that define 
our business management and ethical performance reflect our 
fastidious commitment to do the right thing by our stakeholders.

Our governance structure provides clear direction and assigns roles, 
responsibilities and accountability to individuals within the company. 
Stringent governance practices are championed by the TTI Board  
of Directors and our Executive Committees. The Board of Directors 
approves the ESG strategy of the Group, including the goals, targets and 
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). The ESG Executive Committee 
oversees our ESG Working Committee which in turn is responsible  
for managing our overall Sustainability Strategy. The ESG Working 
Committee, made up of 13 members representing business units  
in each region, works to enhance ESG performance by fine-tuning 
policies, establishing goals and targets, and setting KPIs that are  
used to monitor our performance against our goals and targets.

In 2019, the ESG Working Committee’s working approach and 
initiatives included:

• 

• 

• 

Enhancing ESG performance and strategy implementation 
management by partnering with software data specialists –  
Greenstone – to collect, analyze and better manage our ESG 
data. This has been instrumental in stepping up our internal 
auditing capabilities and ongoing compliance monitoring. Our 
comprehensive global data collection and information sharing 
system also allows us to identify and manage economic, 
environmental and social impacts more efficiently

Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) – As a member since 
November 2019, we joined more than 380 companies and 
organizations to address responsible mineral sourcing in the 
supply chain

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) – Reporting with reference  
to the GRI Standards furthers our ongoing efforts to enhance  
our environmental, social and governance performance and 
transparency in reporting to all of our stakeholders

•  Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) – Becoming a corporate 

member of Habitat for Humanity allows us to support local 
communities and reach parts of the world where we have 
engaged in new business activities with the support of our tools, 
monetary resources and volunteers. More details about our 
global partnerships and community initiatives can be found  
in the Community Engagement section of this report.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Risk Management Process
At TTI, we are vigilant about identifying and managing risk. We actively 
monitor compliance with all local laws, regulations and standards 
related to corporate governance, business operations and product 
safety, employment, health and safety, and the environment on a 

biannual basis. In addition to a dedicated corporate internal audit 
team, TTI also has a comprehensive risk assessment process at all 
business units and levels of the company. Different risk assurance 
teams also maintain close interaction and coordinate efforts through 
different functions.

Our risk mitigation processes include:

Communications
Maintaining a regular dialogue 
with TTI’s external auditor.

Risk Management
Assessing TTI’s risk management and internal 
control systems by formulating an impartial 
opinion on the system, and reporting the ﬁndings 
to the Audit Committee and the senior managers 
concerned, as well as following up on issues to 
ensure that they are satisfactorily resolved.

Assurance
Providing independent assurance of 
the existence and effectiveness of risk 
management activities and controls in 
TTI’s business operations worldwide.

2

Audit Planning 
Developing an annual audit plan to identify 
the highest risks to our business. The plan 
is developed by the Audit Committee and 
TTI’s senior management and takes into 
account our risk assessment methodology 
and TTI’s unique dynamics. The plan is 
reviewed regularly throughout the year to 
reﬂect any changes in the business.

3

Engagement Activities
Conducting various engagement activities, including process, ﬁnancial and compliance 
audits as well as investigations. The results, including deﬁciencies and remediation 
plans developed in conjunction with management, are communicated to individuals 
responsible for taking corrective action, including with TTI senior management and the 
Audit Committee, as appropriate. The scope and frequency of audits vary, depending 
on our assessment of operational and ﬁnancial risks, management considerations, and 
the audit plan’s capacity and strategy.

Diversification of Risk:  
Global Manufacturing Strategy 
TTI diversifies its risks financially and geographically by expanding 
the business’ global footprint. As part of this strategy, TTI has  
built manufacturing operations in several locations including  
Vietnam, Mexico, the United States and China. When expanding  
its manufacturing sites across the globe, TTI implements the same 
policies and compliance programs, and has the same expectations  
in terms of governance across all locations.

The diversification of our manufacturing footprint not only reduces 
financial, environmental and social risks, but also provides an 
opportunity for us to have manufacturing sites closer to our markets. 
This means we can work with local suppliers to both meet our 
standards and reduce the transportation of goods, which helps 
reduce our environmental impact. In addition, it enables us to  
have a positive impact as we hire local employees in workplaces  
that adhere to our ESG standards, and we give back to local 
communities by helping to improve living conditions and education. 
See map on page 26.

Compliance and Code of Conduct
The success of our business is dependent on compliance with 
regulations across all of our markets. We operate in 40 jurisdictions 
and six regions and all business units, partners and suppliers are 
expected to follow local laws and regulations. Our Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct, re-launched in 2019, outlines our commitment  
to employees, customers, suppliers, communities and shareholders. 
This policy is focused on championing integrity in everything we  
do, providing guidelines for conducting business ethically and in 
accordance with all relevant legal requirements. All TTI employees, 
officers and directors globally must fully comply with this Code.  
In addition, we have a number of related policies outlined in our 
Employee Handbook, which must be followed.

Our policies are regularly updated to reflect new laws or market 
concerns. As an example, our Policy Against Slavery and Human 
Trafficking was updated and re-launched in 2019 to include the 
Australian Federal Modern Slavery Act 2018 and the New South 
Wales Modern Slavery Act 2018. A list of TTI’s codes, policies and 
programs which are important to our sustainability initiatives can

Compliance Policy (updated)

Active reporting of all violations of our codes and policies is highly 
encouraged. Complaints can be directed to TTI’s Vice President, 
General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer directly and then 
investigated by our internal audit team, the legal department,  
the human resources department or an independent third party. 

Complaints can also be made using the compliance hotline and 
remedial measures, where needed, are taken accordingly.  
TTI’s compliance hotline allows anyone, including employees, 
suppliers and customers, to raise concerns about potential issues. 
The hotline is operated by an independent third party and all reports 
are handled confidentially and anonymously.

In 2019, there were 22 separate complaints received through either 
the compliance hotline or management. Eleven complaints were 
raised through the hotline from separate sources, and all were 
addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. Of those complaints, 
three were against the same employees alleging bribery. While the 
investigation is still ongoing, we will take appropriate action with 
respect to any allegations of this nature. An additional three employee 
complaints involved employment issues, two complaints were for 
allegations of theft, one was for a violation of a vehicle registration and 
another related to the quality of equipment. The final two complaints 
were reported by suppliers. 20 complaints were made directly to the 
Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer or 
other senior management and all complaints were investigated by our 
internal audit team, the legal department, the human resources 
department or an independent third party. Corrective measures have 
been implemented for those complaints with merit, including termination 
of employment for five employees, payment of penalties or immediate 
remediation. The details of these complaints and corrective measures 
were reported to both management and the Audit Committee.

Anti-Corruption Policy
TTI does not tolerate the occurrence of corruption or bribery internally 
or externally. Our operations are regularly assessed for risk and we 
uphold the highest standards in anti-corruption and the prevention of 
bribery. TTI does not make any political contributions in any markets 
where we operate. A full list of legal and regulatory requirements 
related to anti-corruption practices that have the potential to have a 
significant impact to our operations and performance can be found in 
Appendix A of our HKEX ESG Guide Content Index on our website.

TTI’s anti-corruption strategy is based on prevention, communication and 
training. In 2019, no public legal cases of corruption, anti-competitive 
behavior, anti-trust or monopoly practices were brought against TTI. 
TTI launched comprehensive anti-corruption and anti-trust audio 
training modules to go hand in hand with our updated policies on 
these topics in 2019. These policies serve as supplements to the 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and Employee Handbooks. 
Our employees are required to complete training on all our policies 
and to acknowledge their understanding of the requirements. Our 
new comprehensive anti-corruption training module was launched in 
multiple languages and 60% of employees globally went through the 
more comprehensive training in 2019. In China, TTI has been a 
member of the China Enterprise Anti-Fraud Alliance (CEAFA) since 
2017. The CEAFA is a non-governmental and non-profit cooperative 
organization aiming to establish a clean business environment.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportOverview
TTI is committed to minimizing environmental impact throughout the 
lifecycle of our products and across our value chain. Driven by our focus 
on Innovative Products and Operational Excellence, our responsible 
sourcing and innovative designs have made us a leader in our industry. 
We continuously strive to improve our environmental performance 
through research and development, long-term product planning, 
responsible manufacturing and understanding consumer needs.

Through our environmental initiatives we are focused on furthering 
relevant SDGs. These include striving for clean water and sanitation, 
affordable and clean energy options in our operations and through 
our supply chain, encouraging industry innovation and infrastructure, 
building sustainable cities and communities, championing responsible 
consumption and production in all markets where we operate and 
taking action to combat climate change and its impacts.

Environmental Management
TTI’s environmental strategy for our internal operations is outlined  
in this section and details how this is managed with suppliers is 
included in the Supply Chain section of this report. In subsequent 
sections, environmental information and data from TTI business units 
are presented by region with data from TTI AIP Dongguan highlighted 
separately to show progress from previous years.

Environmental Management Strategy
In 2019, we continued to enhance our environmental management 
strategy across the company with the following priorities:

Our manufacturing sites and offices implement these priorities, follow 
stringent environmental policies, track and measure environmental 
metrics and encourage an ethos of sustainability at all sites. Employees 
receive regular communications on environmental issues and how to 
minimize their impact.

Actions taken across our business units include the ongoing monitoring 
and timely maintenance of air-conditioning, heating, ventilation and 
building management systems to ensure energy efficiency and healthy 
indoor air quality. In addition, other initiatives are implemented such 
as adopting LED-efficient lighting, adjusting lighting levels based on 
occupancy needs and the availability of natural lighting, and separating 
materials for recycling.

A key part of our environmental strategy is focused on developing 
climate resilience. We assess climate change risk, such as impacts 
arising from extreme weather events that affect our operations  
and our supply chain, as part of our risk management approach.  
This includes ensuring our facilities are able to mitigate the impact 
of climate changes through diversifying our manufacturing and supply 
chain, to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and adopting 
renewable energy. Our continued engagement with Greenstone in 
2020 will enable us to have the appropriate system to collect and 
report on the financial implications of climate change.

We are committed to ensuring that our operations and those of  
our suppliers are in compliance with all relevant environmental, legal, 
and regulatory requirements. For a full list of legal and regulatory 
requirements that have the potential to have a significant impact to 
our operations and performance, please refer to Appendix A of our 
HKEX ESG Guide Content Index on our website.

Environmental Management Systems (EMS). Offices in Germany  
are also certified to several DIN ISO standards, including ISO 9001 
and ISO 14001, and are regularly audited by fiscal authorities as  
well as by the German statutory pension insurance body. In addition, 
in North America, TTI PE underwent two significant government 
regulatory inspections, one for air permit compliance and another  
for wastewater discharge compliance, achieving 100% compliance.

As a power equipment and household appliance manufacturer,  
we understand the environmental impact of our operations must  
be properly managed. We continuously strive to improve our 
environmental performance by ensuring our operations not only 
follow local regulations but also meet the high expectations of our 
customers and other stakeholders. Given the critical global need to 
minimize the impact of climate change, TTI’s individual business 
units have environmental management policies in place that cover a 
wide array of issues ranging from energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission management to sustainable buildings for our manufacturing 
sites. Our efforts include striving to manufacture defect-free products 
to reduce waste, enhancing our environmental and hazardous 
substance management systems, investing in new technology and 
equipment, and raising the awareness and skills of our employees 
thereby minimizing our overall environmental impact.

Data Collection and Audit
A renewed focus on measuring environmental performance data  
across our markets was applied in 2019. Greenstone’s ESG data 
collection and analysis software was implemented at all locations of 
TTI. Accordingly, our report provides more comprehensive data on air 
and GHG emissions, energy, water and packaging consumption, and 
hazardous and non-hazardous waste material usage across our markets.

In 2019, TTI AIP and some business units in North America and the 
EMEA regions conducted regular audits of their ISO 14001-certified 

TTI GHG Emissions by Region

Environmental Impact

Reducing Air and GHG Emissions
TTI is consistently working to responsibly manage air emissions 
globally. Air and GHG emissions are mainly the result of office  
energy consumption, transportation and manufacturing processes.  
Air emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), sulphur oxide (SOx) and fine particulate matter (PM) 
emitted from cars, trucks and other small machinery, and from 
combustion processes to generate electricity for manufacturing, 
lighting, building management systems, heating and cooling. 
Fluorinated gases, such as HCFC-22, R-410a and R-404a, are also 
consumed as refrigerants.

Operational Improvements
In 2019, TTI did not have any incidents of non-compliance with 
emissions regulations. We report our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions below for those business units for which data is available.  
Scope 1 emissions arise from onsite sources identified above,  
Scope 2 indirectly arise from purchased electricity and Scope 3 arise 
from business travel, marine transport, and from consumption of water 
and generation of waste. We are continuing to work on expanding our 
disclosure of GHG emissions as we strive to enhance transparency 
across all markets. TTI’s total GHG emissions in 2019 amounted to 
186,793 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportOur business units took the following measures to decrease emissions 
in 2019.

Asia
In Zhuhai, PRC, TTI’s manufacturing operation has various initiatives 
to conserve gas, electricity and water, to enable the reduction of GHG 
emissions. These included buying air conditioners that use refrigerants 
with reduced environmental impact and organizing commuter buses 
for employees, with three of the eight being electric vehicles.

EMEA
At TTI ELC GmbH a partnership was formed with Interseroh which 
works together with the Fraunhofer Institute to calculate the reduction 
of GHG emissions per year related to polyethylene, polypropylene, 
mixed plastic, paper, cartons and wood.

North America
Low-NOx boilers were installed in Milwaukee’s Innovation Center.

TTI AIP
TTI AIP’s GHG emission figures are highlighted in the table below. In 2019, Scope 1 decreased by 2% due to our Continuous Improvement 
Program (CIP) which is designed to reduce energy consumption in our operations. This resulted in an overall emission intensity reduction  
of 6% as compared to 2018, despite an increase in production value of 7% in that same period. In 2019, the heat produced by two air 
compressors, comprising waste heat recovered from the manufacturing process, was used to warm water. The warm water is used as bath 
water for the workers living in the company dormitory. This is the third year that a reduction in emission intensity has been achieved since 2017.

Product Improvements
TTI produces a number of Innovative Products that minimize 
environmental impact. Specific product categories with improved 
features include our cordless tools and lawnmowers as well as our 
low-emission generators.

Gas to Cordless Innovation
Our cordless products are more environmentally-responsible and 
superior in terms of safety and productivity over gas products. Examples 
of these products include the MILWAUKEE MX FUEL Equipment 
System and the RYOBI RLM18X41H240 Cordless Lawn Mower.

MX FUEL Equipment System
While our MILWAUKEE tool line is well known for revolutionary 
cordless power tools using our lithium-ion technology, the brand 
took a groundbreaking step by introducing the cordless MX FUEL 
Equipment System in 2019.

Low-emission Generator
RYOBI RY907022FI Portable Generator
Our RYOBI RY907022FI Portable Generator has also been recognized 
for minimizing carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, as well as having 
safety features that save lives. Portable generators can emit high levels 
of CO. This product is highly regarded for both its built-in sensor that 
triggers an automatic shutoff if CO builds up to dangerous levels and 
its low-emission engine that releases less CO.

Other generators with safety features meet the standard created by 
the Portable Generator Manufacturers’ Association (PGMA), approved 
by the American National Standards Institute. The PGMA standard 
requires that the shutoff mechanism of generators automatically  
stop the engine before CO reaches 800 ppm or if the average 
exceeds 400 ppm over any 10-minute period. TTI, however, follows 
the more stringent UL standard that shuts off if an average of 150 
ppm across any 10-minute period or a peak of 400 ppm arises. 
Since our product was the only one voluntarily tested to meet the UL 
2201 CO safety standard, with its automatic shutoff and for its 
significantly reduced CO emissions, the RYOBI RY907022FI Portable 
Generator was rated No. 1 out of 11 generator models by Consumer 
Reports in 2019.

The MX FUEL Equipment System is the output of years of  
tireless research and investment in new technology and ground up 
development of new batteries, motors and electronics. This system 
aims to eliminate the environmental and health related hazards 
associated with emissions and reduces overall noise and vibration 
while delivering the performance, run time and durability demanded 
by the construction industry. By operating off one completely 
compatible battery system, the system eliminates the limitations  
of gasoline and power cords, thereby taking away the frustrations  
of gas maintenance.

RYOBI Cordless Lawn Mower
Another of our environmentally-conscious products is the RYOBI cordless 
lawn mower. One of our cordless lawn mowers was compared with 
one of our petrol lawn mowers to understand the benefits of the 
cordless technology. The results of the analysis conducted by an 
independent expert showed there is a reduction of 8% in the GHG 
emission footprint of the cordless lawn mower when looking purely at 
the products, namely as a result of their materials, manufacturing 
and assembly. However, an indicative scenario of 500 uses of the two 
products yields different results.

As our business continues to grow with higher production rates  
that make reducing energy consumption difficult to accomplish,  
we therefore focus on improving energy efficiency. TTI is committed 
to embracing and investing in both cleaner and renewable sources 
of energy across all our manufacturing operations.

TTI’s total electricity consumption in 2019 amounted to  
438,340,470 kWh. Consumption figures by region are included  
in the table below.

Business units across the globe took the following initiatives to improve 
energy efficiency.

Asia
In TTI Zhuhai, PRC, production was scheduled to minimize changeover 
so machines were not left idle. In addition, heat treatment and painting 
machines were run continuously to avoid wasting energy during warm 
up and cool down periods.

At TTI AIP, a cooling pump that stops automatically when the air 
conditioning compressor is stopped, was implemented on one of  
the building’s air-conditioning lines to save electricity.

EMEA
DreBo Germany installed a new compressor and used waste heat to 
reduce gas consumption for the factory heating system. The business 
unit also adopted its first hybrid car and is in the process of installing 
electronic car charging stations and providing electronic bikes for 
employees. All employees were educated on the importance of turning 
off lights and devices when leaving the office and only running the 
dishwasher once a day.

North America
In North America, the TTI FC facility in Cookeville installed energy-efficient 
hybrid injection presses in the molding area. Various energy-efficiency 
initiatives were also implemented at Milwaukee. To keep systems running 
efficiently, biannual preventative maintenance was conducted on heating, 
ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment such as remote 
terminal units (RTUs), boilers and pumps. In addition, all HVAC controls 
were put on a building automation system (BAS) to help monitor and 
maintain heating systems for maximum efficiency. Also, filters on all RTUs 
and exhaust systems were changed regularly to help with airflow to reduce 
strain on fan motors. With regards to lighting, a building automation system 
was added to control light levels and run times more effectively.

TTI AIP
Manufacturing output increased by approximately 7% and part of the warehouse facilities were re-purposed as a workshop. As a result, 
overall electricity consumption increased by 5% in 2019 over the previous year. The use of natural gas decreased by 9% compared to  
2018 due to changes in the kitchen equipment. Another key initiative in 2019 was the replacement of the original screw chiller with the 
energy-saving Maglev central chiller. The estimated power savings per year due to this replacement is over 590,000 kWh.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019TTI AIP
To work towards achieving its water reduction targets, TTI AIP 
maintained its wastewater recycling system and took steps to 
strengthen awareness about water conservation among staff. 
The wastewater recycling system reduces consumption of 
fresh water and reduces wastewater discharge to the municipal 
sewage system. A total of 195,955 m3 of water was reused 
through this system at TTI AIP in 2019.

TTI AIP’s consumption rate increased by 5% in 2019 due 
to a break in an underground water pipe. Once detected 
and fixed, additional pipe maintenance was conducted to 
prevent and minimize the impact of future occurrences.

Waste, Materials and Recycling Management
TTI is focused on reducing our consumption of materials and 
minimizing the generation of waste throughout our operations.  
When waste production cannot be avoided, we ensure recycling or 
responsible disposal procedures are followed. Across our facilities 
and offices, building management services provide separate  
bins for recyclables and properly dispose of non-hazardous and  
hazardous waste.

Hazardous waste is managed using scheduled pick-ups by licensed  
professionals to ensure its proper disposal. To improve our waste 
management process, we continuously track the types of waste 
disposed of by our business units. In 2019, there were no incidents 
of non-compliance with waste management regulations.

In 2019, TTI produced 38,563 tonnes of non-hazardous waste and 
1,570 tonnes of hazardous waste. Waste primarily consists of cutting 
fluid, dye coating, filter, oily sludge, organic solvent, packaging 
bucket, packaging / container, rags, batteries, and WEEE waste.

Reducing Water Usage
TTI is also actively working to improve our water management to 
address worldwide concerns over water scarcity. Our efforts are  
put towards finding ways to consume water efficiently and maximize 
its beneficial use. TTI obtains all water for its operations from local 
sources and has not had any issues with sourcing. All of our operations 
follow regulations for water usage and wastewater discharge and,  
in 2019, there were no incidents of non-compliance.

In 2019, TTI’s total water consumption amounted to 1,288,367 m3. 
Consumption figures by region are included in the tables below.

Examples of market-specific water conservation initiatives are  
as follows.

Asia
In TTI’s Zhuhai PRC operation, cooling water was recycled, regular 
checks were conducted on water pipes and water usage was closely 
monitored to detect leakage. In addition, conservation of water and 
other natural resources was promoted.

EMEA
DreBo Germany continues to avoid fluid cooling systems for machining 
when possible to minimize water consumption.

North America
At TTI PE, water-saving fixtures were installed in new facilities and 
fixtures were checked to ensure they are set to optimize water use.

In addition to managing our own water consumption, we also ensure 
that any legacy issues at the sites that we operate at are addressed. 
For example, TTI PE continues to contribute to the Anderson and 
Pickens community by aggressively addressing legacy environmental 
issues created by previous owners of properties. To reduce risk to the 
community, all issues are currently contained and the cleanup is well 
underway. Since 2016, over 160 million liters of groundwater have 
been treated.

At Milwaukee, motion-sensing faucets were installed in all restrooms 
to reduce water flow.

Local regulations and building management procedures determine 
how waste is managed in each of our locations. Initiatives by region 
are outlined as follows.

Asia
TTI AIP provided recycling training and campaigns for employees 
twice in the year and achieved an overall recycling rate of 97.1%. 
Recycled input materials used in primary products consisted of  
4,688 tonnes of recycled paper, which amounted to 13.5% of  
all paper consumed in 2019. Overall, at TTI AIP, the quantity of 
hazardous waste generated increased substantively in 2019 by  
30%. The increase in hazardous waste generation resulted from several 
factors, including increased testing conducted at our laboratories, and 
by our regulatory team, operating a new chemical testing laboratory, 
our TTI Suzhou laboratory moving operations back to TTI AIP, as well as 
floorcare products, which went from being outsourced to being 
produced by TTI AIP. In TTI Zhuhai, materials such as paint containers, 
cooling water and plastic boxes were recycled. Paint line changes 
were also minimized to reduce the hazardous waste generated with 
each change.

EMEA
In Germany, offices recycled scrap, paper, emulsion, used oil and 
batteries according to local laws. DreBo Germany achieved an overall 
recycling rate of 90%. At TTI ELC GmbH, 80% of input materials 
used to manufacture primary products comprised recycled materials. 
Actions to reduce hazardous and non-hazardous waste products 
were taken according to two European directives, REACH and RoHS. 
Lead material was added to the scope of REACH, which led to 
efforts to track the amount of lead used and to work on corrective 
actions with suppliers to remove or substitute lead materials. In 
addition, responsible waste disposal initiatives were adopted for 
batteries, recyclables and organics.

North America
At TTI NA, single stream recycling of Styrofoam, glass, office paper, 
cardboard and plastic bottles is conducted using separate containers 
for dry recyclables and wet waste provided by building management. 
In addition to paper recycling containers, the pantry has designated 
waste receptacles for recyclables and waste. The bags for waste and 
recyclables are made from biodegradable and compostable material.

At TTI PE, washable tableware was purchased for the cafeteria, break 
areas and conference catering. A dishwasher was also installed, 
reusable takeout containers provided and a food bio-digester for  
food waste management was installed. In addition, the office paper 
recycling program was upgraded and a plastic bottle and aluminum 
can recycling program was added, achieving an 83% solid waste 
diversion rate in 2019. In Canada, a new waste diversion program 
was initiated at all offices in 2019. This included separating organic 
and non-organic waste and eliminating all single-use plastic at the 
head office and service centers. As a result, 0.091 tonnes of plastic 
and 0.141 tonnes of disposable paper cups were avoided. The 
in-house recycling program now captures 90% of recyclable materials.

The principles of minimizing waste and effectively managing materials 
are built into our product planning process and considered from the 
design stage through to after sales. As described in the next section, 
the initiatives embedded in the product lifecycle of our Powerful Brands, 
including our design, packaging, product reconditioning scheme and 
battery recycling programs are key to our environmental strategy.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Product Lifecycle Management
Measures to reduce environmental impact are, when feasible, 
integrated across the lifecycle of our products starting from product 
design as a key part of the production process, all the way through  
to the end of the product’s life. Even after products are sold, our 
efforts to minimize waste continue through our comprehensive 
product reconditioning schemes and battery recycling programs 
across all markets.

2.  Responsible Product Packaging
Another environmental management initiative in our product lifecycle is 
in the way we approach packaging materials. Environmentally responsible 
packaging and packing materials are a key focus for TTI as these 
minimize our impact and reduce our material and transportation 
costs. The most common materials we use for packaging include 
paper for boxes, cartons, die cut sheets, and plastic for polybags, 
bubble bags, clamshells and tool bags. We consciously use recycled 
materials whenever possible, opting for corrugated cardboard, 
honeycomb board, chipboard, paperboard and / or molded pulp.  
We also use biodegradable packaging and paper in packaging products.

Driven by our consistent efforts to achieve Operational Excellence in 
all areas of our business, TTI strives to adopt more environmentally 
responsible packaging and packing options across our business 
units. This resulted in a nearly 39% reduction of packaging used  
in 2019 as compared to the year before. Packaging and paper data 
globally and by region are included in the below charts.

1.  Innovative Design
Our environmental considerations begin with design innovation.  
Our research and development projects aim to enhance the user 
experience, ensure the safety of the production process and of the 
end user, reduce emissions, improve resource efficiency, and 
increase the durability and recyclability of our products where 
possible, in order to work towards a closed loop, circular economy. 
TTI conducts lifecycle assessments and takes recyclability, reparability 
and longevity of products into consideration during our design 
development stage.

One example is the successful RYOBI cordless tools which currently 
rely on One+ lithium-ion battery technology. This brand platform 
meets all our design objectives as they are easier for customers to 
use and also effectively reduce resource consumption and waste.  
Our cordless tools effectively minimize waste as they are powered  
by a system which has remained consistent since the launch of TTI’s 
first RYOBI ONE+ Battery Tool in 1996. The original ONE+ Battery was 
a NiCad battery and it was replaced by our newer lithium-ion battery 
platform in 2007. Tools which use these NiCad batteries can still  
be used with the lithium-ion battery. Likewise, a battery from a 
previous generation can also be used with a newly launched tool. 
With the connection system remaining consistent between the battery 
and the tool, our system has allowed end users to buy compatible 
tools, batteries and chargers separately, minimizing waste and excess 
consumption for the past 23 years.

TTI AIP monitors its packaging material composition and recycling 
on a daily basis. In 2019, packaging redesign resulted in avoided 
consumption of 201 tonnes of paper and 25.8 tonnes of plastic. 
Overall, packaging consumption comprised 31,492 tonnes of paper, 
approximately 300 tonnes of polyfoam and 4,536 tonnes of bags for 
DIY tools. The performance of our PRC operations provides a good 
example of our progress in this area. More information is provided 
in the TTI AIP Packaging Initiative spotlight example.

EMEA
TTI Central Europe maintained an almost paperless office, with TTI 
Eastern Europe using recycled Xerox paper for internal use and 
reusing carton boxes for deliveries. TTI ELC GmbH adopted 
measures to reduce paper consumed in the sample inspection  
report process.

North America
TTI PE teams are always looking for sustainable and efficient packaging  
options that meet shipping requirements. In 2019, testing was 
implemented to replace or reduce polybags, Styrofoam and corrugated  
materials. Testing was completed and changes were implemented  
that are expected to result in a 113 tonnes reduction in corrugated 
material in the coming year. Also, testing is underway and looking 
favorable to reduce the use of polybags in favor of biodegradable 
materials. At TTI FC, initiatives to reduce foam packaging and 
cardboard were implemented at our manufacturing operations  
in Cookeville.

99

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Manuals and Safety Literature
Another area where our responsible packaging initiatives have 
been successful is in our approach to the instruction manuals 
and safety literature, which accompany our products.

Beginning in 2012, TTI business units initiated various cost 
reduction measures, which also minimize our environmental 
impact, mainly by reducing the amount of paper we use in 
manuals. As a result, ANZ and EMEA regions reduced the 
number of pages in their outdoor and power tool manuals by 
48% and 36%, respectively. The techniques used to achieve 
these types of savings include:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Implementing new manual templates to reduce overall 
white space and thus page count

Reducing manual paper weight, thereby reducing the 
cost and amount of paper

Transitioning from wood-free paper to 100%  
recycled paper

Eliminating redundant warnings, instructions and 
specifications for less complex tools, thereby reducing 
the length of manuals

Replacing manuals with simple one page instructions  
or installation sheets for spare parts and consumables 
such as filters

Replacing instructional text with instructional graphics 
and pictograms where appropriate, thereby reducing 
manual length

Across the globe, TTI has service centers where products are 
professionally repaired to extend usage and minimize waste.  
TTI operates 45 service centers and 1,386 are operated by third parties.

4.  Battery Recycling Program
Another important product lifecycle initiative to reduce environmental 
impact is our battery recycling program. As described above, TTI is a 
leader in the design and manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, which 
are interchangeable within each brand to reduce battery waste.  
We strive to implement recycling partnerships globally with the goal 
of increasing the recycling rate of batteries and products, which 
have reached the end of their useful lives.

Different markets partner with various external organizations to 
reduce battery waste, thereby responsibly recycling our batteries and 
our products containing batteries. In North America, rechargeable 
battery recycling is done through our partner, Call2Recycle®. 
Call2Recycle®, North America’s first and largest battery stewardship 
program, has been collecting and recycling batteries since 1994 and 
is the first program of its kind to receive the Responsible Recycling 
Practices Standard (R2) certification.

In 2019, over 100 tonnes of batteries were collected for recycling 
from TTI’s plants and offices across North America. This significant 
increase from the 33 tonnes collected in 2018 was due to TTI’s 
active efforts in facilitating collection from sites. TTI pays stewardship 
fees to Call2Recycle® based on North American battery and battery 
product sales. In return, TTI has the licensing rights to apply the 
Call2Recycle® battery recycling seals on our batteries, products and 
packaging. Customers can easily access the toll-free number on the 
seal in order to locate collection sites in the United States and Canada. 
Customers can also go to the website at www.call2recycle.org to find 
the locations of more than 25,000 collection sites, including local 
household hazardous waste sites and national retailers.

3.  Product Reconditioning Program
Our product reconditioning scheme is another initiative that minimizes 
environmental impact, and results in 80% of the original product being 
reused with labor being conserved. Reconditioned tools, power tools 
and outdoor equipment under our consumer power tools brands are 
sold through our Direct Tools Factory Outlets. As a result, waste is 
avoided, TTI can guarantee quality and our customers are able to 
reuse the products with a one year warranty.

All reconditioned products, including batteries and chargers, are 
rigorously inspected for mechanical problems. Products are then 
professionally repaired by manufacturer-trained technicians who  
use replacement parts from our factory. After this, the products are 
tested to ensure they are working at optimal standards and packaged 
as certified pre-owned units. In this way, the lifecycle of our products  
is extended without compromising on quality.

In 2019, Call2Recycle® collected and recycled over 3,175 tonnes  
of batteries in North America with rechargeable batteries accounting  
for approximately 2,268 tonnes of that total. Based on a recent audit, 
65-70% of rechargeable batteries collected are power tool batteries, 
many of which are TTI brands. Since its inception, Call2Recycle®  
has collected and recycled more than 71,214 tonnes of batteries  
in North America.

Apart from our partnership with Call2Recycle®, we partner with 
recycling organizations across the globe as outlined below.

Asia
In the PRC, TTI has been partnering with recycling companies 
specializing in battery recycling for several years. In 2019, 74 tonnes of 
batteries and cells were collected and recycled from TTI’s sites.

ANZ
In Australia and New Zealand, the business units have partnered with 
Envirostream and other retail partners to ensure battery recycling 
stations have been established in their stores. Battery drop-off stations 
are provided at point of sale locations and within service centers.  
The batteries are crushed down to recover cobalt, copper, steel and 
aluminium. These materials are then returned to the manufacturing 
sector. This process also produces Mixed Metal Dust (MMD) which  
is used as an input material in the manufacture of cathode materials 
for new batteries. This revolutionary approach to battery recycling 
ensured that over 38 tonnes of battery waste was repurposed and 
saved from landfills through the partnership with Envirostream in 
2019. TTI continued to participate in the industry-led voluntary 
program, Batteries 4 Planet Ark (B4PA) stewardship scheme in 
Australia in 2019. This program also helps divert batteries from 
landfill and supports a circular economic model which returns 
materials in manufacturing sectors.

EMEA
In Europe, battery recycling is organized according to applicable 
national laws derived from the European Union Battery Directive.  
We have joined common collection schemes in each country that 
involve registering with the local authorities, reporting sales to 
authorities, joining a collection scheme and financing the recovery 
of batteries based on reported sales.

The common collection scheme is acting on behalf of the producers 
who supply containers for battery collection to retail outlets, public 
institutions and commercial end users. The producers organize the 
transport of full containers to sorting facilities where the batteries are 
sorted according to their various electrochemical system properties 
and materials. The batteries are then treated in recycling facilities to 
recover materials such as iron, manganese, nickel and lead. The whole 
process is controlled by the common recycling scheme to ensure 
compliance with all legal requirements and environmental, health  
and safety standards. 26 tonnes of batteries were recycled in 2019.

North America
In addition to Call2Recycle®, other battery recycling partnerships 
were pursued by business units in North America. At TTI FC, batteries 
were recycled through Blue Sky Recycling with batteries collected 
from our facility by a vendor. In 2019, 4 tonnes of batteries were 
recycled by Brown’s Recycling.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAll suppliers also have access to our third-party operated,  
TTI compliance hotline so they can play an active role in compliance 
and improved performance. Suppliers are encouraged to actively 
report actions that are in violation of our codes and policies.  
In 2019, three suppliers contacted the hotline regarding three 
non-compliance issues. Those were related to a contract violation, 
an allegation of overpayment for equipment and a quality issue.

TTI considers anti-corruption and bribery prevention a top priority. 
Our supply chain is regularly assessed for corruption risk and 
misconduct is not allowed among suppliers. We not only conduct 
investigations upon receiving tips and complaints, but also proactively 
conduct supplier and service provider audits as described below. 
There were no cases of anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust or 
monopoly practices in 2019.

In 2019, TTI also took measures to enhance our approach to trade 
compliance by hiring a global trade compliance vice president and 
trade compliance officers across our business units. We also amended 
our Business Partner Code of Conduct hiring to expand on the trade 
compliance provisions, which clearly outline our requirements in 
relation to trade sanctions.

Overview
Our ESG initiatives on both a global and market-specific level extend 
to our suppliers. TTI works with a large number of suppliers around 
the world. We encourage our business units to engage with local 
suppliers as much as possible to support local economies and create 
a positive impact. Our suppliers are essential to the quality of our 
products and our overall success. As a result, we work to ensure  
that sustainability practices are properly implemented across our 
supply chain. This includes a commitment to security and social 
responsibility, complying with all applicable laws and regulations  
and minimizing environmental impact.

The TTI Social & Environmental Responsibility (SER) Compliance 
Program is used to manage all TTI suppliers around the globe.  
Key compliance requirements are outlined in codes and policies 
that form part of the agreement terms with our suppliers. All suppliers 
must acknowledge and comply with our policies, especially those 
outlined in our Business Partner Code of Conduct, which was revised 
in 2019 and will be re-launched in 2020 to address updated trade 
sanction provisions.

TTI’s Online Compliance Platform allows business units to work with 
suppliers globally to improve the transparency of our supply chain 
and the efficiency of our data collection process. Through this platform, 
business units request supplier information, and suppliers are  
able to access training materials and acknowledge their acceptance 
of key compliance requirements online. The information received 
from suppliers is used to generate a rating which forms part of  
each supplier’s overall KPI. This allows TTI to determine whether  
to continue the relationship with the supplier. Key compliance policies 
accessible to suppliers online include:

Environmental and Social Responsibility 
in the Supply Chain
TTI works with suppliers that are committed to minimizing their 
environmental impact and upholding high standards for human 
rights. On the environmental front, pollution prevention, resource 
efficiency and responsible sourcing are some of the key initiatives 
that are monitored. Recognizing that the sourcing of raw materials,  
as well as activities along the supply chain and at product end of life 
can have an impact on biodiversity, we actively engage with suppliers 
to maintain accountability. We perform extensive due diligence to 
ensure our suppliers are meeting our environmental standards across 
all markets. As outlined in the Supplier Auditing section below, all 
new suppliers must undergo a rigorous vetting process and we 
regularly review existing suppliers to ensure they adhere to all 
regulations and our stringent policies.

Our environmental initiatives go hand in hand with raising awareness 
and improving human rights conditions in the supply chain. The SER 
Compliance Program focuses on stringent labor rights, in particular 
reinforcing TTI’s commitment to no child or forced labor. In 2019, 
there were no incidents of non-compliance raised.

A number of policies outlined in our Governance section above protect 
human rights in our supply chain. Of these, our Policy Against Slavery 
and Human Trafficking specifically addresses TTI’s expectations in 
relation to human rights and modern slavery and the consequences 
of non-compliance. This policy has been communicated globally to all 
our suppliers and is available in all local languages where we operate. 
Suppliers are required to fill in detailed questionnaires. The steps 
taken by TTI to proactively avoid and address risks related to modern 
slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain are as follows:

Our protection of human rights extends to our conflict minerals 
initiatives. In 2010, the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) issued the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act requiring companies to disclose if their products 
contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold (3TG) mined from the 
Democratic Republic of Congo or its surrounding countries.  
TTI’s Conflict Minerals Policy outlines the standards that TTI  
and its suppliers must follow to ensure that any 3TG is from 
reputable sources, free from conflict or other human rights 
violations. Conflict Minerals Declaration forms are completed by 
suppliers annually, according to which all suppliers must provide 
details about their source of 3TG and acknowledge compliance 
with the Conflict Minerals Policy. Our policy also mandates that 
suppliers must source from a conflict-free smelter.

In 2018, we conducted a review of suppliers using cobalt in products 
sold to TTI and as a result, a procurement policy for cobalt was 
implemented in 2019. As with the Conflict Minerals Policy, suppliers 
must comply with the policy and report the source of cobalt used  
in the manufacturing of TTI products. The Cobalt Procurement 
Policy, aimed at eliminating any form of human rights violations  
in cobalt sourcing, was launched through our supply chain compliance 
platform. As with conflict minerals, we engaged a US-based, third 
party to conduct ongoing analysis of compliance data and  
risk assessments.

In 2019, no high-risk cases were identified in our conflict minerals 
and our cobalt due diligence campaigns.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportOur approach to managing ESG concerns in our supply chain are 
highlighted for specific regions below.

Asia
At TTI AIP, our global sourcing and purchasing department and 
teams from the quality department are responsible for supply chain 
performance. In 2019, the TTI AIP team engaged with suppliers from 
different regions, Asia, Europe, and the USA. 230 audits were 
conducted on existing suppliers and all new suppliers were screened 
for environmental and social criteria with no major non-compliance 
found. In TTI Zhuhai, the initiatives included an annual quality audit 
of key suppliers and full audits of new suppliers covering areas such 
as Hazardous Substances Process Management (HSPM), social and 
environmental responsibility, environment management systems and 
factory security.

EMEA
In the EMEA region, we worked with suppliers from Europe, 
the USA and Asia in 2019. At TTI ELC GmbH, our purchasing 
team audited non-EU suppliers on ISO 14001 compliance.

North America
In North America, we worked with suppliers from Europe, the USA 
and Asia in 2019. The TTI PE team engaged with suppliers to reduce 
plastic in packaging and as part of this initiative, Hart Tools also 
implemented a program to reduce corrugated material by 114 tonnes 
in 2020.

Also, in 2019, TTI became a member of the Responsible Minerals 
Initiative (RMI), which facilitates effective due diligence over conflict 
mineral and cobalt supply chains in accordance with the OECD  
Due Diligence Guidance. Through RMI, TTI has access to a number  
of valuable resources that can support responsible sourcing decisions. 
The resources include:

• 

• 

• 

Reasonable country of origin (RCOI) data: country of origin 
information associated with smelters and refiners that are 
validated through the Responsible Minerals Assurance  
Process (RMAP)

Smelter database: an online database of data obtained through 
RMAP and workgroup research on thousands of companies in 
the 3TG and cobalt supply chains

Country risk assessment platform: a practical tool for companies 
to identify conflict-affected and high-risk areas using resources 
recommended by the OECD and the European Commission

A member of

Supplier Auditing
TTI’s SER Compliance team and external auditors conduct quality 
management system audits on a regular basis. The SER audits 
involve a comprehensive supplier scorecard that tracks a number  
of issues including anti-corruption, workers’ rights and safety and 
environmental impact. New suppliers are also required to complete  
a screening and audit process before engagement. The engagement 
of new suppliers is conditional on them having SER policies and 
practices that are in accordance with our policies, best practices,  
and applicable laws and regulations. Suppliers with an unacceptable 
rating are given a probation period to rectify any issues and are then 
re-evaluated. Suppliers are audited every 12 to 18 months if their 
previous audit result was rated acceptable. More frequent audits are 
carried out on suppliers with lower ratings. Suppliers are terminated  
if they are found to be non-compliant in areas where TTI has a 
zero-tolerance policy, such as for corruption, child or forced labor 
and harassment. In 2019, our internal audit department launched 
investigations and conducted audits into several sectors, including 
raw material and part suppliers, administration service providers,  
fire protection and security suppliers as well as scrap handling  
and transportation suppliers. The results of all investigations were 
addressed and reported. As a result, six employees and three 
suppliers were disciplined.

Working at TTI

Employee Handbook and Code of Conduct
Each TTI business unit has an Employee Handbook written specifically 
for its location that incorporates all relevant and applicable employment 
policies, procedures and best practices, as well as national and local 
regulations. Handbooks are updated annually or when significant 
changes occur. All employees are required to read and sign off on the 
Employee Handbook when they join, as well as when changes are made.

Everyone at TTI, including employees, officers and directors across 
different business units, are expected to fully adhere to our Code of 
Ethics and Business Conduct. All of TTI’s new hires are required to 
complete training on the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and 
everyone must take an e-learning course on modern slavery and 
human trafficking. In the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
training, we provide real-life scenarios of harassment, and human 
and labor rights violations, for employees to be able to better identify 
issues and report them accordingly. Employees are encouraged to 
actively report activities that are not compliant with our codes and 
policies to senior management or via the compliance hotline, as 
outlined in the Governance section of this report.

108

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEqual Employment Opportunities
TTI is committed to treating all individuals with dignity and respect. 
We provide equal employment opportunities for all qualified persons, 
without regard to race, national origin, gender or gender identity, 
sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, religion, military service, status  
as an individual with a disability or status as a veteran or any other 
status protected by applicable local, state or national law.  
Our commitment to equal opportunity practices is outlined in our 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which covers our overall 
philosophy and approach to harassment prevention, anti-discrimination 
and anti-retaliation. Our employees receive regular training on 
our e-learning platform and in face-to-face sessions. All employees 
are required to take an e-learning course on addressing discriminatory 
issues to understand how to manage any such incidents, should 
they occur. 

In 2019, no incidents of discrimination were found to have occurred 
and therefore, no corrective actions had to be taken.

Our equal opportunity practices are aligned to cultivate inclusion 
and diversity, celebrate differences and welcome all employees to 
participate fully in our business. Practices in regions highlighted 
below serve as examples of our commitment.

Asia
In Asia, TTI AIP offers a special recruitment campaign for disabled 
persons in the community. Across the PRC, business units follow 
local laws that protect female employees. Qualified candidates are 
hired regardless of gender, with many female students and individuals 
from under represented groups joining the company.

ANZ
In Australia and New Zealand, business units work to achieve 
merit-based selection and promotion and to apply the principle of 
fairness in decision making. This policy extends to external contractors 
and anyone who provides goods and services to our customers. Bullying 
is not tolerated under any circumstances and no employee is penalized 
or disadvantaged as a result of raising genuine concerns or complaints 
relating to discrimination or harassment.

EMEA
In EMEA, DreBo Germany follows German laws that set a quota on 
the integration of employees with a disability.

Human and Labor Rights
TTI takes human and labor rights very seriously. We comply with all 
international, national, state and local employment laws, in addition 
to International Labor Organization (ILO) core labor standards to 
ensure our workers are treated fairly. TTI does not tolerate child or 
forced labor under any circumstances. As such, we always ensure 
that workers are of appropriate age and that working hours are 
managed according to legal requirements. Across all markets, 
workers must have the required legal permits to work at our facilities 
and we ensure the same requirements are applied and respected  
in our supply chain.

A full list of legal and regulatory requirements related to human and 
labor rights that have the potential to have a significant impact to 
TTI operations and performance can be found in Appendix A of our 
HKEX ESG Guide Content Index on our website.

Some examples of our labor practices in specific regions are  
as follows.

Asia
Policies followed by our People’s Republic of China (PRC) business 
units demonstrate how we manage fair labor practices. We have 
stringent policies regarding child labor, juvenile workers and forced 
labor. Our PRC facilities never hire anyone under the age of 16 and 
only hire workers between the ages of 16 and 18 during peak seasons 
for non-hazardous work. TTI requires our PRC locations to adhere to 
the Juvenile Worker Protection Policy and register workers with the local 
labor bureau. In addition to following TTI policies, our PRC locations 
have instituted several preventative actions including checking 
identification cards (with date of birth information) via a system 
linked with public security agencies, and registering the names of all 
juvenile workers with the local labor bureau. To ensure freedom of 
association and collective bargaining rights are respected, workers 
have access to the union where they can express their concerns 
and opinions, which are in addition to TTI’s established channels.

ANZ
In Australia and New Zealand, the business units are legally  
obligated to consult with employees in the event of any major 
workplace change. This practice is continuously adopted by TTI 
ANZ and as a result, the company has not had any litigation cases 
related to a breach of procedural fairness.

North America
Our business units in the United States also provide a good example 
of how fair labor practices are maintained. All employees must complete 
a formal application for employment. For workers between the ages 
of 16 and 18, we follow local guidelines that limit the number of 
hours allowed and we ensure that working hours are approved by  
the parent or legal guardian.

109

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019North America
In the United States, TTI’s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
Policy, as well as its affirmative action obligations, have full support 
from senior management. All employees are encouraged to be engaged 
in the EEO Policy and affirmative action initiatives to ensure the 
success of the program. TTI FC NA develops affirmative action 
programs in accordance with the EEO policy on an annual basis.  
At TTI PE, the team actively recruits female engineers to apply to 
TTI, and also attends career fairs hosted by women’s organizations, 
such as Clemson’s Women in Engineering to keep the recruitment 
pool diverse. At TTI Canada, the policy is to hire the best candidate 
for the role, with job postings advertised on national job boards to 
encourage a wide range of applicants. 

ANZ
In Australia and New Zealand employees are provided with an 
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which gives them access to 
online wellbeing portals as well as six free sessions with a trained 
counselor. Offsite team building days are encouraged to ensure  
good camaraderie within teams, creating fun within the workplace. 
Offices also offer bonus incentive programs to the majority of our 
employees and healthy initiatives such as company-supplied fruit 
bowls. TTI ANZ has a paid parental leave policy which is above 
government entitlements for paid maternity and paternity leave. 
This is designed to provide a supportive and inclusive approach 
towards people, and is awarded based on a years of continuous 
service to promote engagement and retention.

Employee Benefits and Wellbeing
TTI considers employee benefits to be a valuable part of working at 
TTI. The wellbeing of our employees is very important, and this is 
reflected in our practice of ensuring employees receive competitive 
benefits above and beyond what is legally mandated. Each of our 
business units puts special emphasis on providing incentives such  
as gym memberships, sports facilities and flexible working hours that  
are relevant to their local employees. Here are some examples across 
our regions. Apart from wellness initiatives, TTI offers parental leave 
benefits to employees, with 1,044 females taking leave in 2019.

Asia
In Asia, TTI AIP contributes to a housing fund for all employees as 
per local government requirements. Employees can access the full 
amount of this fund when they retire or when they need to purchase 
a house. In addition to government-stipulated benefits, TTI AIP also 
offers family-friendly initiatives such as games and DIY competitions 
for employees and their families, as well as an office tour and a free 
buffet lunch so families can visit and learn more about the company. 
TTI AIP received the 2019 American Chamber of Commerce in 
Southern China’s HR Best Practice –  Premium Innovation Pioneer 
Award for its initiatives. Other PRC business units also provide similar 
benefits. In TTI Suzhou and TTI Shanghai, employees are offered 
annual physical check ups and small gifts to celebrate traditional 
holidays such as the moon and dragon-boat festivals. In TTI Zhuhai, 
team building activities, such as a day out at the Mysterious Land 
Park, were organized.

In Hong Kong, TTI has set up a “Wellbeing Room” furnished with 
electrical outlets for connecting pump attachments and a refrigerator 
for storing expressed breast milk. This supports our female employees 
who continue to breastfeed after returning to work from maternity 
leave. At TTI HK, we also run a weekly Green Monday program to 
encourage employees to eat healthier vegetarian meals.

EMEA
In the EMEA region, DreBo Germany provides flexibility in shift 
work planning and incentives for long service. At our operations in 
TTI MEA, ergonomic seating and monitors that reduce eye strain  
are provided.

North America
In North America, TTI provides a basic level of benefits, called  
“Core Benefits” at no cost to the employee. In addition, employees 
have the opportunity to enroll in “Additional Coverage” for themselves 
and their families. For most plans, coverage is effective on the first 
day of active employment. Benefits include comprehensive medical, 
dental, vision, life insurance, flexible spending accounts and 
disability coverage. In addition, employees can participate in  
a tax-qualified savings plan to help them save for their retirement. 
The savings plan provides Pre-Tax, Roth* and After-Tax options, 
including a generous match. All employees, regardless of whether 
they are full-time, part-time or temporary hires are eligible to contribute 
immediately to the savings plan.

TTI NA offers flexible work programs, including reduced hours and 
work-from-home options, which are offered on a case-by-case basis. 
Other offices like TTI PE has an onsite Wellness Director with 250 
employees participating in wellness classes each week. A new onsite 
Healthy Choice cafeteria program with incentives and regular lunch 
and learn nutrition classes are also offered. Outreach to those with 
special dietary needs and the opportunity to meet with a dietician  
and wellness director has also been implemented. As a result, the 
new cafeteria has seen up to 300 transactions a day. At TTI Canada, 
some initiatives include annual monetary wellness benefits, a daily 
fruit bowl, healthy snack breaks, monthly in-house yoga sessions and 
massages. Milwaukee hired a new chef to revamp the cafeteria menu 
and provide healthier food options for employees.

Social Impact
Our social initiatives are designed to benefit employees, customers as 
well as the wider community.

Employee Initiatives
When it comes to our employees, positive impact is created by ensuring 
their health, safety and wellbeing is well taken care of and they are 
provided with training and development opportunities to broaden 
their skills and reach their potential.

Occupational Health and Safety
TTI employees are the foundation of our business and we are 
committed to their safety at work. To do this, we focus on monitoring 
our occupational health and safety performance across all our 
markets. Our Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) and Occupational 
Hazard Management Policies and systems are designed to ensure 
that all safety issues, risks and hazards are identified with measures 
adopted to avoid, eradicate and minimize wherever possible any 
potential injury, harm or other occurrence, and to mitigate and 
address any incidents or violations with follow-up investigations and 
corrective actions adopted. Comprehensive Occupational Health and 
Safety (OHS) training initiatives in local markets are an important part 
of our strategy to uphold the highest standards of workplace safety. 
Our OHS management systems ensure we comply stringently with all 
relevant legal requirements and in 2019, there were no incidents of 

non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes. Despite this, 
there were 184 recorded work-related injuries and 2,625 lost  
days due to injury across our global operations. There were 16 
high-consequence injuries recorded, including those involving 
splinters, cuts, strains and bruising arising from slips, falls, manual 
handling or mechanical work. In 2019, there were no work-related

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Training and Development
As a key part of their development, employees receive annual 
performance reviews conducted by their managers. During these 
yearly appraisals, training needs and targets are planned and 
discussed with managers.

Another major employee initiative is the provision of training and 
development opportunities. Across our regional business units, 
training is provided according to job levels and for specific functions. 
Training topics range from new hire orientation to technical skills and 
product training, to marketing and customer service. TTI sponsors 
professional memberships, fully reimburses seminars and business 
conferences and organizes in-house and external training, coaching 
and mentorship programs to support our people to enhance their 
skills. We also provide financial support for continuing education.

Training and employee development at TTI is focused around Learn 
TTI, an online training platform that offers courses for employees, 
ranging from mandatory courses on compliance for all employees,  
to professional courses designed for employees at different levels of 
the company. A total of 362 unique courses were launched on Learn 
TTI in 2019. Of these, training courses on TTI’s three new policies  
in relation to compliance and ESG, were implemented globally.  
TTI employees engaged in 919 courses through Learn TTI, equivalent  
to 149,780 training hours this year. In addition, other e-learning 
platforms such as TTI’s intranet and Litmos in ANZ are also used for 
training. Training hours completed by region are listed in the table below.

Asia
All our business units have OHS management systems covering 
onsite work activities as well as traffic safety and safety practices in 
dormitories and the canteen. Health and safety training is provided to 
all employees and EHS teams conduct regular inspections of health 
and safety performance. In addition, third parties are brought in to 
regularly identify and monitor hazards and ensure procedures are 
properly implemented to prevent incidents.

ANZ
TTI ANZ’s Work Health and Safety Committees meet at least quarterly 
and report on performance and compliance to the Group HR Manager 
and Presidents of the business unit. Toolbox talks focusing on safety 
regularly take place and all facilities have trained first aid officers and 
dedicated fire wardens.

EMEA
In addition to comprehensive OHS management systems implemented 
across the EMEA region, each of our German business units also engage 
external health and safety officers and company doctors as required 
by law, who are also members of health and safety steering committees 
along with representatives of the workers’ council and employees.

North America
OHS policies are regularly reviewed to ensure standards are maintained 
across our North American business units. At TTI PE, provincial 
health and safety officials make periodic visits to sites to ensure 
compliance with legal requirements. At TTI FC, an onsite EHS Director 
and Coordinator monitors safe working practices onsite and holds 
regular employee briefings to receive suggestions for improvement. 
TTI Canada has a health and safety committee that meets on a 
quarterly basis and provides first-aid courses for both employees 
across its operations and personnel at all of its service centers.

Leadership Development Program (LDP)
The Leadership Development Program is a key initiative for TTI. This challenging program nurtures talent with training, support and freedom 
to experience numerous aspects of the business by providing opportunities to move across sales, marketing and management roles. Many of 
our executives have been through the LDP and have been promoted to serve at the top level of management. There were 509 promotions 
as a result of the LDP in 2019.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Customer Initiatives
TTI’s customer centric practices focus on user satisfaction, safety  
and protection. We strive to build continuous improvement into our 
processes, to provide customers with the best possible products and 
user experience.

Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction of all our products – whether they are designed, 
manufactured, distributed or licensed by TTI – is extremely important 
to us. We provide a product warranty period so that our customers 
have a satisfactory after-purchase experience. In addition, we have  
a policy of taking all customer feedback seriously and proactively 
review comments on social media and online sales platforms. If a 
complaint or after-sale service request is received, all issues are 
recorded and analyzed so our design team can utilize the data to 
improve the product.

Examples of initiatives taken by specific regions to ensure customer 
satisfaction are as follows.

Asia
In the PRC, the Shanghai business unit established a product service 
center to provide repair services to customers, with more service 
centers to be established in 2020. The sales and Jobsite Solution 
teams also offer product safety training to customers. 

EMEA
In the EMEA region, TTI ELC GmbH arranges technical training at  
the product information center for customers, including dealers  
and OEM partners. At TTI MEA, around 50 end user safety training 
sessions were held and service agent training was also conducted.  
At TTI Iberia, end user safety presentations are provided by the Job 
Site Solution team.

North America
At TTI PE, customer service lines are staffed seven days per week  
for all tool brands. Every effort is made to satisfy each caller including 
sending new tools and parts free of charge when appropriate.  
At TTI Canada all our Field Service and Customer Service 
Representatives must attend a course on Building Customer 
Relationships. Customer and trade school demonstrations are  
also run, where safe tool handling practices are followed.

We meet or exceed all applicable and voluntary industry standards 
globally. Relevant legal and regulatory requirements related to health 
and safety, advertising, labeling and privacy matters relating to our 
products that have the potential to significantly impact our operations 
and performance are listed in Appendix A of our HKEX ESG Guide 
Content Index on our website.

114

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportSafety of End Users
A key part of our customer relations policy is focused on ensuring  
the safety of our end users. All our products are tested for safety  
and quality to ensure TTI products are the safest and most innovative 
items available. Internal audit investigations and ongoing compliance 
monitoring are key to our customer management strategy so that high 
standards are maintained and immediate remedial actions can be 
taken if and when required. Our comprehensive product safety and 
consumer product regulatory compliance policy and systems are 
managed by our Global Product Safety Director. At each business unit, 
our Product Safety Directors, Committees and teams oversee the safety, 
quality and regulatory compliance of our products. We strive for 
continual improvement of our safety and regulatory functions globally.

Any product recalls are referred to our legal teams, and together with 
the safety and regulatory departments, they ensure compliance with 
regulations for managing recalls until their safe disposal. We have a 
rigorous quality assurance process in place, including quality control 
of incoming materials, in-process quality control, and inspection and 
reliability testing of our outgoing products.

In 2019, there were no recalls of TTI products due to health and 
safety reasons.

Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
Our commitment to customer protection extends to the safety of  
their personal data. To ensure that all collected data is protected,  
we comply with all relevant legal requirements. In 2018, TTI became 
compliant under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation.  
All of our computer systems are protected by authorization management 
processes and monitored by our IT department. TTI has over eight 
global security policies in place to protect our data systems. In 2019, 
there were not any substantiated complaints concerning breaches of 
customer privacy and data.

TTI’s management of cybersecurity covers the protection of customer 
data, the growth of our business and intellectual property. Cybersecurity 
is managed by our Group Senior Manager Cybersecurity who leads 
the Informational Technology Steering Committee (ITSC) which meets 
monthly. We follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Cybersecurity Framework. This framework includes our guidelines 
and outlines our approach to cybersecurity. All systems in the company 
run anti-virus and anti-malware programs and we have local firewall 
rules, file integrity scanning and network-level firewalls in place.  
All our employees are updated about cyberattacks and email phishing 
and are trained on how to remain protected. For cloud-based services, 
we ensure that protection of both TTI’s and our customer’s information 
is properly managed through relevant agreements and practices.

Intellectual Property Rights
Along with data, our intellectual property is one of TTI’s most valuable 
assets. TTI’s intellectual property portfolio includes logos, patents, 
trademarks, copyrights, computer software and trade secrets.  
We have procedures and policies in place for the proper use and 
protection of our intellectual property rights and for our protection 
from infringement by others. We encourage and support our employees’ 
inventions, discoveries, ideas, concepts, written material or trade 
secrets and cooperate in the documentation of ownership of such 
intellectual property. As a responsible business, we respect the 
intellectual property rights of others and communicate and train  
our employees to not use patented, trademarked, copyrighted or 
otherwise protected intellectual property.

In TTI MEA, US$15,000 worth of products, such as generators, 
pumps and lights, were donated to support disaster relief after the 
Mozambique hurricane.

North America
Another environmental endeavor is TTI Canada’s participation in the 
CN Tower Climb, raising US$1,636 for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). 
In 2019, TTI Canada was proud to run a national program for 4Oceans 
raising US$1,152 which equates to eliminating the equivalent of 
0.062 tonnes of waste from oceans and shorelines.

Home-building and Support for Veterans
In 2019, TTI became a global partner of Habitat for Humanity. 
Habitat for Humanity is an NGO with programs tackling the issue of 
homelessness in the community and focuses on building new homes 
for low-income households.

A global partner with

TTI PE donated products, helping Habitat affiliates build homes, 
communities and hope for various locations in the United States.  
TTI employees volunteered more than 480 hours in the Habitat 
Executive Build program, showing their support to the local communities 
where TTI sponsored house building for underprivileged families.  
TTI PE employees volunteer in the Habitat – Women’s Build program 
and also support the program by raising money to fund the cost of 
building houses. 

Apart from Habitat, TTI PE works with The Home Depot Foundation 
and Team Depot, a 400,000-strong army of associate volunteers,  
to improve the homes and lives of United States veterans.  
The Foundation trained skilled tradespeople to fill labor gaps and 
support communities impacted by natural disasters.

Overview
TTI has a long-standing commitment to supporting communities in 
which we operate. With the understanding that the robust community 
programs are good for business and our stakeholders, oversight of 
our community investment strategy remains an important objective of 
our social initiatives. 

TTI recognizes the importance of engaging with communities to jointly 
address environmental and social concerns. At the corporate level, 
our strategic plan for community engagement focuses on key areas 
most relevant to our company and those that will create the biggest 
impact to our business and the communities in which we serve.  
These include promoting women’s rights and education, fighting 
modern slavery and poverty, developing clean technology and raw 
material sustainability and responsibility.

In 2019, we continued our engagement with local communities across 
different business units by donating tools, providing financial support 
and encouraging our employees to volunteer their time and effort. 
Some of our business units allocate a specific number of working 
hours or days for employees to volunteer for their favorite charity.  
Our employees can choose a variety of areas to support, ranging  
from the environment, education, home building and child wellness 
to sports.

Some of our business units have formal committees that select 
organizations through which employees can embark on community 
engagement projects. Other business units sponsor the same causes 
annually while also evaluating new partnerships as they arise. In 2019, 
in-kind donations of tools and other items, equivalent to approximately 
US$830,000, US$1.1 million in financial support and over 4,100 hours 
of volunteer time were donated by TTI and our employees globally. 
We also partnered with or supported over 50 programs run by charities 
and NGOs. Here are a few of our many engagement activities by 
region in 2019.

Environmental and Disaster Relief Initiatives

Asia
An environmental initiative that continues to be championed by  
TTI HK is its Green Fair. The fair is held at the office to support  
local organic farmers and fair-trade merchants and all proceeds  
are donated to the New Life Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association  
to provide support to individuals with mental health issues in the 
community. As part of this initiative, TTI HK employees along with 
their family members visit the Go Green Organic Farm to enjoy a  
day out and learn about farming and biodiversity in Hong Kong.

117

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019From 2017 to 2019, TTI HK actively supported the Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology, the Technological and 
Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong (THEi) and the  
Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) in creating higher-quality 
product design and engineering programs. We provided internships for 
41 individuals from around the world. Our interns are on average, 
20-years old and hail from different educational backgrounds, with 
many coming from overseas universities, such as the University  
of British Columbia, Oxford University, McGill University and the 
University of Manchester. During the program, interns were assigned 
to various departments with some working for multiple departments 
during their time with TTI HK. Two interns joined TTI HK following 
their internship with the company.

Outside of Hong Kong, youth development is also pursued in locations 
like Cambodia. TTI provided power tools for the construction of three 
educational facilities at Kung Ruth Village, Cambodia through  
The IDEA Project in 2019, with the project and volunteer tour scheduled 
to take place in early 2020.

TTI Canada also supports Habitat for Humanity on a national level 
and 47 colleagues were involved in four Habitat for Humanity builds 
with one in both Montreal and Calgary and two in Toronto in 2019.

Another business unit, Milwaukee Brookfield also worked to build 
homes for those in need, specifically veterans. Milwaukee supported 
the Veterans Outreach of Wisconsin (VOW) and Operation Tiny Home 
(OTH) organizations in 2019. Engagement with VOW and OTH entailed 
eight volunteers contributing 88 hours to help homeless and at-risk 
veterans by providing food, clothing, shelter and other basic human 
needs. Cash contributions were also donated to purchase land and 
complete surveys, and 65 tools were donated to veterans.

Nurturing the Next Generation
Our business units support a number of educational and wellbeing 
initiatives for youth across the globe.

Asia
A number of Asian community initiatives are focused on youth 
development. In Hong Kong, TTI has been providing practical design 
technology workshops to BTEC Engineering high school students 
from the English School Foundation, West Island School. In 2019,  
the workshop extended into a 4-day study tour at TTI AIP. Through 
the tour, students were able to learn from experts representing 
different brands and production lines and receive hands-on tool 
training at the Pudwill Leadership Center (PLC).

Students from West Island School were also able to take part in an 
8-week Concept Engineering Internship Program in 2019. During 
this, students studied drill and impact driver electro-mechanisms for 
one week, joined 101 PLC training sessions and a factory tour for  
one week and learned about concept development and prototyping 
for the remaining six weeks.

118

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEMEA
In the EMEA region, German business units such as DreBo Germany 
supported specific areas of education, sports and local associations 
focusing on youth and children. Programs included support for 
children and teens in a local traditional music society, youth and 
children’s festival support and engagement with local kindergartens.

North America
TTI Canada supports children’s education and sports activities  
such as baseball and hockey through monetary donations.  
Milwaukee Brookfield also engaged in various projects to nurture 
youth. The main goal of their initiatives in 2019 included stimulating 
interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 
(STEM) education. As part of the STEM education program, the 
Milwaukee business unit organized a First Robotics Day for employees 
to be mentors to teams. For this project, 25 employees signed up to 
volunteer and six employees were placed as mentors contributing 
350 hours as part of Weekly First Mentorships. Another initiative 
planned was a STEM activity for 60 students from Burleigh Elementary, 
whose task was to work with eight TTI volunteers to use lemons and 
potatoes to light up a light bulb. The Milwaukee team also participated 
in the NSBE Professional Partners in the Classroom (PPiC) program at 
a local high school, Bradley Tech, to discuss careers in STEM and 
financial information with high school students approaching graduation. 
Other initiatives were CareerX and Careers Uncovered programs where 
TTI participated with other companies to promote STEM technical 
careers at Milwaukee and Waukesha Schools. Our employees also 
volunteered in the LAUNCH Innovation Challenge where they mentored 
student teams on challenges posed by Milwaukee employees to solve 
real business problems.

Supporting Women and Girls

A member of

Asia
With women’s rights and education identified as a key area for TTI,  
in 2019 TTI HK ran an internship program with the Asian University 
of Women (AUW). AUW caters to students from 20 countries 
around the region that are home to marginalized groups, including 
garment factory workers, Rohingya refugees and women from conflict 
zones in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. By recruiting from marginalized 
groups, AUW aims to identify talent in places where women’s potential 
is undervalued or ignored. In this way, the university provides a platform 
for women with few opportunities to acquire a world-class education 
and create and sustain international networks of women leaders and 
their supporters.

TTI’s internship program provided AUW students with invaluable work 
experience, while allowing personal and professional development to 
occur. Through this initiative, we were delighted to introduce these 
women to the professional working world, empowering them and giving 
them the opportunity to improve their decision-making, organizational, 
communication and interpersonal skills. TTI HK is committed to 
continuing this partnership with AUW in 2020.

North America
One of the initiatives TTI Canada is very proud of over the past four 
years is participation in the unique program, ‘Girls Can Too’, which 
introduces construction skills to female high school students from 
low-income families in Toronto. This practical program is operated  
by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority with the assistance  
and support of key members of the design, construction and related 
industries including E.R.A. Architects and Milwaukee Tools.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019TO THE MEMBERS OF TECHTRONIC INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED
創科實業有限公司
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 
referred to as the “Group”) set out on pages 136 to 222, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at  
December 31, 2019, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at  
December 31, 2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have 
been properly prepared in compliance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“the Code”), and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

132

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Independent Auditor’s ReportKey Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter

How our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter

Capitalization of Deferred Development Costs
We identified the capitalization of costs as internally-generated 
intangible assets as a key audit matter which requires estimations 
and assumptions about the expected future economic benefits to 
be generated by the products resulting from these development 
activities. The Group conducts a significant level of development 
activities and has to apply judgement in identifying those projects 
meeting the criteria for capitalization under the requirements of 
the accounting standards, the expected life of the products and, to 
capture accurate time and cost information for those projects.

As disclosed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, as 
at December 31, 2019 the carrying value of deferred development 
costs was US$388 million with the additions and amortization charge 
during the year being US$152 million and US$98 million respectively.

Recognition of income and deferred tax
We identified the recognition of income of income and deferred tax as 
a key audit matter as the Group operates in a complex multinational 
tax environment, in which the tax amounts, including provisions 
for potential tax exposures, and the realizability of the deferred tax 
asset, which depends on whether sufficient taxable profits or taxable 
temporary differences will be available in the future, are associated 
with a high degree of estimates and judgement.

As disclosed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, as 
at December 31, 2019, the Group has recognized US$46 million of 
income and deffered tax expense in the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

Our procedures in relation to capitalization of deferred development 
costs included:

• 

• 

• 

• 

Obtaining an understanding of management’s process and 
controls over the capitalization of deferred development costs;

Evaluating the nature of the type of development expenses 
incurred that are capitalized into intangible assets;

Assessing the reasonableness of the capitalization based on 
our knowledge of the Group’s business strategy, historical track 
record and sales forecasts prepared by management; and

Evaluating the appropriateness of expenses capitalized, on a 
sample basis, by agreeing the material costs, overheads and 
engineers’ hours incurred to external invoices and internal 
timesheets and payroll records.

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment about the 
recognition of income and deferred tax included:

•  Understanding and evaluating the management’s procedures 
and relevant controls regarding the completeness of tax 
exposures and estimating the provision for income tax and 
deferred tax assets to be recognized.

• 

In understanding and evaluating management’s estimates and 
judgements, we considered the status of current tax authority 
inquires, judgmental positions taken in the tax returns, the 
outcome of previous inquiries and current estimates and 
developments in the tax environment;

•  We used our tax specialists to evaluate and challenge the 

adequacy of management’s key assumptions and read the latest 
correspondence with the tax authorities to assess management’s 
estimates; and

• 

Evaluating management’s assessment of the sufficiency of 
future taxable profits supporting the recognition of deferred tax 
assets.

133

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance 
with section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability 
to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
the directors.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to 
cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Independent Auditor’s ReportAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in the independent auditor’s report is Stephen David Smart.

Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). The address of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company is 29/F, Tower 2, 
Kowloon Commerce Centre, 51 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung, New Territories, Hong Kong.

The principal activities of the Group are the manufacturing and trading of electrical and electronic products.

The functional currency of the Company is United States dollars (“US$”).

2.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”)

New and Amendments to HKFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
The Group has applied the following new and amendments to HKFRSs and an interpretation issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) for the first time in the current year:

HKFRS 16 
HK(IFRIC)-Int 23 
Amendments to HKFRS 9 
Amendments to HKAS 19 
Amendments to HKAS 28 
Amendments to HKFRSs 

Leases
Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
Annual Improvements to HKFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle

Except as described below, the application of the new and amendments to HKFRSs and the interpretation in the current year has had no 
material impact on the Group’s financial performance and positions for the current and prior years and/or on the disclosures set out in 
these consolidated financial statements.

2.1  HKFRS 16 Leases

The Group has applied HKFRS 16 for the first time in the current year. HKFRS 16 superseded HKAS 17 Leases (“HKAS 17”), and 
the related interpretations.

Definition of a Lease
The Group has elected the practical expedient to apply HKFRS 16 to contracts that were previously identified as leases applying 
HKAS 17 and HK(IFRIC)-Int 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease and not apply this standard to contracts that 
were not previously identified as containing a lease. Therefore, the Group has not reassessed contracts which already existed prior 
to the date of initial application.

For contracts entered into or modified on or after January 1, 2019, the Group applies the definition of a lease in accordance with 
the requirements set out in HKFRS 16 in assessing whether a contract contains a lease.

As a Lessee
The Group has applied HKFRS 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application,  
January 1, 2019. As at January 1, 2019, the Group recognized additional lease liabilities and measured right of use assets 
(“ROU assets”) at the carrying amounts as if HKFRS 16 had been applied since commencement dates, but discounted using the 
incremental borrowing rates of the relevant group entities at the date of initial application by applying HKFRS 16. C8(b)(i) transition. 
Any difference at the date of initial application is recognized in the opening retained profits and comparative information  
has not been restated.

When applying the modified retrospective approach under HKFRS 16 at transition, the Group applied the following practical 
expedients to leases previously classified as operating leases under HKAS 17, on lease-by-lease basis, to the extent relevant to the 
respective lease contracts:

i. 

ii. 

relied on the assessment of whether leases are onerous by applying HKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets as an alternative of impairment review;

elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with lease term ending within 12 months from the date of  
initial application;

142

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20192.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

2.1  HKFRS 16 Leases (continued)

As a Lessee (continued)
iii.  excluded initial direct costs from measuring the ROU assets at the date of initial application;

iv.  applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with a similar remaining terms for similar class of underlying assets in 

similar economic environment; and

v. 

used hindsight based on facts and circumstances as at date of initial application in determining the lease term for the Group’s 
leases with extension and termination options.

When recognizing the lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases, the Group has applied incremental 
borrowing rates of the relevant group entities at the date of initial application. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate 
applied is approximately 2.8%.

2.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

New and revised HKFRSs in issue but not yet effective (continued)
In addition to the above new and amendments to HKFRSs, a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting was issued in 2018. 
Its consequential amendments, the Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in HKFRS Standards, will be effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020.

Other than described below, the directors of the Company consider the application of the new and amendments to HKFRSs would not 
have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39 and HKFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
The amendments deal with issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark 
with an alternative interest rate and address the implications for specific hedge accounting requirements in HKFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments (“HKFRS 9”) and HKAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which require forward-looking analysis. 
The amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements so that entities would apply those hedge accounting requirements 
assuming that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows from the hedging instrument are based will 
not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments also require specific disclosures about the extent to which 
the entities’ hedging relationships are affected by the amendments. There are also amendments to HKFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures regarding additional disclosures around uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform. The application of 
the amendments is not expected to have significant impact on the financial position and performance of the Group but may affect the 
presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2018 (the “New Framework”) and the Amendments to 
References to the Conceptual Framework in HKFRS Standards
The New Framework:

• 

• 

• 

• 

reintroduces the terms stewardship and prudence;

introduces a new asset definition that focuses on rights and a new liability definition that is likely to be broader than the definition it 
replaces, but does not change the distinction between a liability and an equity instrument;

discusses historical cost and current value measures, and provides additional guidance on how to select a measurement basis for a 
particular asset or liability;

states that the primary measure of financial performance is profit or loss, and that only in exceptional circumstances other 
comprehensive income will be used and only for income or expenses that arise from a change in the current value of an asset or 
liability; and

• 

discusses uncertainty, derecognition, unit of account, the reporting entity and combined financial statements.

Consequential amendments have been made so that references in certain HKFRSs have been updated to the New Framework, whilst 
some HKFRSs are still referred to the previous versions of the framework. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020, with earlier application permitted. Other than specific standards which still refer to the previous versions 
of the framework, the Group will rely on the New Framework on its effective date in determining the accounting policies especially for 
transactions, events or conditions that are not otherwise dealt with under the accounting standards.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. In addition, the 
consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock 
Exchange (the “Listing Rules”) and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (“CO”).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are 
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods.

146

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if 
market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value 
for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-
based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are accounted for in 
accordance with HKFRS 16 (since January 1, 2019) or HKAS 17 (before application of HKFRS 16), and measurements that have some 
similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realizable value in HKAS 2 Inventories or value in use in HKAS 36  
Impairment of Assets.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:

• 

• 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and

• 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

• 

• 

• 

has the power over the investee;

is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each item of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity therein, which represent present ownership 
interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets of the relevant subsidiaries upon liquidation.

147

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Business Combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities 
incurred by the Group to the former Owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except that:

• 

• 

• 

• 

deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in 
accordance with HKAS 12 Income Taxes and HKAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements 
of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with HKFRS 2 
at the acquisition date (see the accounting policy below);

assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard; and

lease liabilities are recognized and measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments (as defined in HKFRS 16) as if 
the acquired leases were new leases at the acquisition date. ROU assets are recognized and measured at the same amount as the 
relevant lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after re-assessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets 
in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by- 
transaction basis.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and considered as part of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted 
retrospectively, with the corresponding adjustments made against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise 
from additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how 
the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with HKFRS 9 or HKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less any 
accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating 
units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes and not larger than an operating segment.

148

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Goodwill (continued)
A cash-generating unit (or groups of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or 
more frequently whenever there is indication that the unit may be impaired. For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a reporting period, 
the cash-generating unit (or groups of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment before the end 
of that reporting period.

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (or groups of cash-generating units). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized 
directly in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit or any of the cash-generating unit within the group of cash-generating units, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the amount of profit or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of 
an operation within the cash-generating unit (or a cash-generating unit within a group of cash-generating units), the amount of goodwill 
disposed of is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation (or the cash-generating unit) disposed of and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit (or the group of cash-generating units) retained.

Interests in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates. Changes 
in net assets of the associate other than profit or loss and other comprehensive income are not accounted for unless such changes 
resulted in changes in ownership interest held by the Group. When the Group’s share of loss of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the 
Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of that associate.

An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee becomes an associate. On 
acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after 
reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

The Group assesses whether there is an objective evidence that the interest in an associate may be impaired. When any objective 
evidence exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with HKAS 36 
as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying 
amount. Any impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any assets, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the 
investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in accordance with HKAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of 
the investment subsequently increases.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in the 
investee with a resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate and the 
retained interest is a financial asset within the scope of HKFRS 9, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and 
the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the 
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing the relevant interest in the 
associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or 
loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) upon disposal/partial disposal of the relevant associate.

149

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Interests in Associates (continued)
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies 
to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group (such as a sale or contribution of assets), profits and losses resulting from 
the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associate that are not related to the Group.

Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets Acquired Separately

Intangible assets acquired separately and with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately 
are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses (see the accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on 
tangible and intangible assets below).

Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially measured at their fair value 
at the acquisition date. The cost of these intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated 
impairment losses (see the accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on tangible and intangible assets below).

Internally-Generated Intangible Assets – Research and Development Expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development activities (or from the development phase of an internal project) is 
recognized only if all of the following have been demonstrated:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and

• 

the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The amount initially recognized for an internally-generated intangible asset is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when 
the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized, development 
expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, an internally-generated intangible asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses (if any), on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognized.

Leases
Definition of a Lease (upon Application of HKFRS 16 in accordance with Transitions in note 2)

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.

For contracts entered into or modified or arising from business combinations on or after the date of initial application, the Group assesses 
whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under HKFRS 16 at inception, modification date or acquisition date, as 
appropriate. Such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.

The Group as a Lessee (upon Application of HKFRS 16 in accordance with Transitions in note 2)

Allocation of Consideration to Components of a Contract
For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand- alone price of the lease component and the 
aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

Non-lease components are separated from lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.

As a practical expedient, leases with similar characteristics are accounted on a portfolio basis when the Group reasonably expects that the 
effects on the consolidated financial statements would not differ materially from individual leases within the portfolio.

Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases of certain property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the recognition exemption 
for lease of low-value assets. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight- 
line basis or another systematic basis over the lease term.

ROU Assets
The cost of ROU assets includes:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;

any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and

an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is 
located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

ROU assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities.

ROU assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term are 
depreciated from commencement date to the end of the useful life. Otherwise, ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

The Group presents ROU assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Refundable Rental Deposits
Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at initial 
recognition are considered as additional lease payments and included in the cost of ROU assets.

Lease Liabilities
At the commencement date of a lease, the Group recognizes and measures the lease liability at the present value of lease payments that 
are unpaid at that date. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

151

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Leases (continued)
The Group as a Lessee (upon Application of HKFRS 16 in accordance with Transitions in note 2) (continued)
Lease Liabilities (continued)
The lease payments include:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;

variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and

payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

After the commencement date, lease liabilities are adjusted by interest accretion and lease payments.

The Group remeasures lease liabilities (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related ROU assets) whenever:

• 

• 

the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the related lease 
liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the date of reassessment.

the lease payments change due to changes in market rental rates following a market rent review/expected payment under a 
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the related lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using 
the initial discount rate.

The Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Lease Modifications
The Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if:

• 

• 

the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and

the consideration for the leases increases by an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the increase in scope and any 
appropriate adjustments to that standalone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.

For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group remeasures the lease liability based on the lease term of 
the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

The Group accounts for the remeasurement of lease liabilities by making corresponding adjustments to the relevant ROU asset. When 
the modified contract contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the modified contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and 
the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Group as Lessee (prior to 1 January 2019)
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognized as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidation statement of 
financial position as a finance lease obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs (see the 
accounting policy below).

Operating lease payments, including the cost of acquiring land held under operating leases, are recognized as an expense on a straight-
line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

The Group as Lessee (prior to 1 January 2019) (continued)
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, these incentives are recognized as a liability. The aggregate 
benefits of incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Property, Plant & Equipment
PP&E including buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, other than 
construction in progress, are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Freehold land is not depreciated and are measured at cost less subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of items of PP&E, other than freehold land and construction in progress, over their estimated 
useful lives and after taking into account of their estimated residual values, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, 
residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.

Construction in progress includes PP&E in the course of construction for production or for its own use purposes. Construction in progress 
is carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Construction in progress is classified 
to the appropriate category of PP&E when completed and ready for its intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as 
other PP&E, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Ownership Interests in Leasehold Land and Building
When the Group makes payments for ownership interests of properties which includes both leasehold land and building elements,  
the entire consideration is allocated between the leasehold land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values at  
initial recognition.

To the extent the allocation of the relevant payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold is presented as “ROU assets” (upon 
application of HKFRS 16) or “prepaid lease payments” (before application of HKFRS 16) in the consolidated statement of financial 
position. When the consideration cannot be allocated reliably between non-lease building element and undivided interest in the underlying 
leasehold land, the entire properties are classified as PP&E.

An item of PP&E is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the item) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognized.

Impairment PP&E, ROU Assets and Intangible Assets other than Goodwill (see the Accounting Policy in 
respect of Goodwill above)
At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets with finite 
useful lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. The recoverable 
amount of PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets are estimated individually. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. In addition, 
the Group assesses whether there is indication that corporate assets may be impaired. If such indication exists, corporate assets are also 
allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset (or a cash-generating unit) for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

153

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment PP&E, ROU Assets and Intangible Assets other than Goodwill (see the Accounting Policy in 
respect of Goodwill above) (continued)
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. For corporate assets or portion of corporate assets which 
cannot be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to a cash-generating unit, the Group compares the carrying amount of a 
group of cash-generating units, including the carrying amounts of the corporate assets or portion of corporate assets allocated to that 
group of cash-generating units, with the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units. In allocating the impairment loss, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if applicable) and then to the other assets on a pro-rata 
basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit or the group of cash-generating units. The carrying amount of an asset is not 
reduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of disposal (if measureable), its value in use (if determinable) and zero. The amount 
of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro-rata to the other assets of the unit or the 
group of cash-generating units. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating 
units) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit or a 
group of cash-generating units) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when a group entity becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and 
derecognized on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables arising from contracts with 
customers which are initially measured in accordance with HKFRS 15. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(“FVTPL”)) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognized immediately in 
profit or loss.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest 
income and interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Financial Assets

Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized cost:

• 

• 

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and

the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“FVTOCI”):

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling; 
and

the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets (continued)
All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship and, that 
at the date of initial application/initial recognition of a financial asset the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair 
value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) if that equity investment is neither held for trading nor contingent 
consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which HKFRS 3 Business Combinations applies.

A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:

• 

• 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or

on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

• 

it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

Amortized Cost and Interest Income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for financial assets measured subsequently at amortized cost. Interest 
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets 
that have subsequently become credit-impaired (see below). For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest 
income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period. If 
the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income 
is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the beginning of the reporting 
period following the determination that the asset is no longer credit impaired.

Financial Assets at FVTPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI or designated as FVTOCI are measured at 
FVTPL except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in 
profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial assets.

Impairment of Financial Assets
The Group performs impairment assessment under expected credit loss (“ECL”) model on financial assets (including trade and other 
receivables, bills receivable, trade receivables from associates, bank balances, deposits and cash) and other items (financial guarantee 
contracts) which are subject to impairment under HKFRS 9. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in 
credit risk since initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of the relevant instrument. In 
contrast, 12-month ECL (“12m ECL”) represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date. Assessments are done based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 
factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current conditions at the reporting 
date as well as the forecast of future conditions.

The Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables without significant financing component. The ECL on these assets are 
assessed collectively using a provision matrix with appropriate groupings.

For all other instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to 12m ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, in which case the Group recognizes lifetime ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be 
recognized is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.

(i)  Significant Increase in Credit Risk

In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at 
the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is 
reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost  
or effort.

155

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)
(i)  Significant Increase in Credit Risk (continued)

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit 
default swap prices for the debtor;

existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant 
decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that 
results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable 
information that demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition if the debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined to 
have low credit risk if i) it has a low risk of default, ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations 
in the near term and iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, 
reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a debt instrument to have low 
credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of ‘investment grade’ as per globally understood definitions.

For financial guarantee contracts, the date that the Group becomes a party to the irrevocable commitment is considered to be the 
date of initial recognition for the purposes of assessing impairment. In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts, the Group considers the changes in the risk that the specified 
debtor will default on the contract.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the 
amount becomes past due.

(ii)  Definition of Default

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default occurs when information developed internally or 
obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking 
into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past  
due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is  
more appropriate.

(iii)  Credit-impaired Financial Assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events of default that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the 
following events:

(a)  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;

(b)  a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)
(iii)  Credit-impaired Financial Assets (continued)

(c) 

the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted 
to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; or

(d) 

it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.

(iv)  Write-off Policy

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and 
there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example, when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered 
into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery 
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Any subsequent 
recoveries are recognized in profit or loss.

(v)  Measurement and Recognition of ECL

The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a 
default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data 
adjusted by forward-looking information. Estimation of ECL reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined 
with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights.

Generally, the ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract 
and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.

For a financial guarantee contract, the Group is required to make payments only in the event of a default by the debtor in 
accordance with the terms of the instrument that is guaranteed. Accordingly, the expected losses is the present value of the 
expected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs less any amounts that the Group expects to receive from 
the holder, the debtor or any other party.

For ECL on financial guarantee contracts for which the effective interest rate cannot be determined, the Group will apply a discount 
rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows but only 
if, and to the extent that, the risks are taken into account by adjusting the discount rate instead of adjusting the cash shortfalls  
being discounted.

Where ECL is measured on a collective basis or cater for cases where evidence at the individual instrument level may not yet be 
available, the financial instruments are grouped on the basis as below:

•  Nature of financial instruments (i.e. the Group’s trade receivables are each assessed as a separate group. Trade receivables 

from associates and other receivables are assessed for expected credit losses on an individual basis);

• 

Past-due status;

•  Nature, size and industry of debtors; and

• 

External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit  
risk characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset unless the financial asset is credit impaired, 
in which case interest income is calculated based on amortized cost of the financial asset (i.e. gross carrying amount less loss 
allowance for ECL).

For financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowances are recognized at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance determined 
in accordance with HKFRS 9; and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognized 
over the guarantee period.

157

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Assets (continued)
(v)  Measurement and Recognition of ECL (continued)

Except for financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial 
instruments by adjusting their carrying amount, with the exception of trade receivables where the corresponding adjustment is 
recognized through a loss allowance account.

Financial Liabilities and Equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity Instrument
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Buy-back of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost
Financial liabilities (including unsecured borrowings, trade and other payables, bills payable and discounted bills with recourse) are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
A financial liability is held for trading if:

• 

• 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or

on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

• 

it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.

Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date when a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments for cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

Assessment of Hedging Relationship and Effectiveness
For hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group considers whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in cash  
flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge 
effectiveness requirements:

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;

the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and

the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually 
hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Liabilities and Equity (continued)
Hedge Accounting (continued)
Assessment of Hedging Relationship and Effectiveness (continued)
If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective 
for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances 
the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized 
immediately in profit or loss.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (hedging reserve) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as the recognized hedged item Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the 
cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

Discontinuation of Hedge Accounting
The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the 
qualifying criteria. This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. Discontinuing hedge 
accounting can either affect a hedging relationship in its entirety or only a part of it (in which case hedge accounting continues for the 
remainder of the hedging relationship).

For cash flow hedge, any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognized when the forecast transactions is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Guarantee Contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss 
it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt 
instrument. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group measures the financial guarantee contract at the higher of: (i) the amount of 
the loss allowance determined in accordance with HKFRS 9; and (ii) the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative 
amortization recognized over the guarantee period.

Derecognition

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group continues to 
recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement and recognizes an associated liability. If the Group retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also 
recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are derecognized only when the obligation specified in the relevant contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. The 
difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.

Offsetting a Financial Asset and a Financial Liability

A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when, 
and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

159

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

Provisions for the expected cost of assurance-type warranty obligations under the relevant contracts with customers for sales of goods are 
recognized at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle  
the Group’s obligation.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of inventories is calculated using the first-in, first-out method. Net 
realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make 
the sales.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when “control” of the goods or services underlying 
the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or 
services that are substantially the same.

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognized over time by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the 
relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met:

• 

• 

• 

the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs;

the Group’s performance creates and enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or

the Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the distinct good or service.

Over time Revenue Recognition (Commission and Royalty Income): Measurement of Progress towards 
Complete Satisfaction of a Performance Obligation
The progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured based on output method, which is to recognize 
revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer to date relative to the 
remaining goods or services promised under the contract, that best depict the Group’s performance in transferring control of goods  
or services.

As a practical expedient, if the Group has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Group’s 
performance completed to date (i.e. royalty income), the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Group has the right to 
invoice.

Refund Liabilities
The Group recognizes a refund liability if the Group expects to refund some or all of the consideration received from customers.

Sale with a Right of Return/Exchange
For a sale of products with a right of return/exchange for dissimilar products, the Group recognizes all of the following:

(a) 

revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled (therefore, revenue 
would not be recognized for the products expected to be returned/exchanged);

(b)  a refund liability; and

(c)  an asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for its right to recover products from customers.

160

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests 
are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the 
temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or 
the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognises the ROU assets and the related lease 
liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax deductions are attributable to the ROU assets or the lease liabilities.

For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group applies HKAS 12 Income Taxes 
requirements to the leasing transaction as a whole. Temporary differences relating to ROU assets and lease liabilities are assessed on 
a net basis. Excess of depreciation on ROU assets over the lease payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities resulting in net 
deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied to the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in 
the accounting for the business combination.

In assessing any uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Group considers whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will 
accept the uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by individual group entities in their income tax filings. If it is probable, 
the carrying amounts of the current and deferred taxes are determined consistently with the tax treatment in the income tax filings. If it is 
not probable that the relevant taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of each uncertainty is reflected by using 
either the most likely amount or the expected value.

Foreign Currencies
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that 
entity (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting 
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates at that date. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

161

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Foreign Currencies (continued)
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognized in profit 
or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on a monetary item that form part of the Company’s 
net investment in a foreign operation, in which case, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity and will be reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period, and 
their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of translation reserve (attributed to non-controlling interests 
as appropriate).

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that 
includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners 
of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in the 
Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are reattributed to non-controlling 
interests and are not recognized in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates that do not result in the 
Group losing significant influence), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after  
January 1, 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end 
of the reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on acquisitions of foreign operations before January 1, 2005 
are treated as non-monetary foreign currency items of the acquirer and reported using the historical exchange rate prevailing at the date 
of the acquisition.

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions
The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments determined at the grant date without taking into consideration all non-market 
vesting conditions is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve). At the end of each 
reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest based on assessment of all relevant 
non-market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

At the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognized in employee share-based compensation reserve will 
be transferred to share capital. When the share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the amount previously 
recognized in the employee share-based compensation reserve will be transferred to retained profits.

The fair value of services received determined by reference to the fair value of shares awarded at the grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve).

When the trustee purchases the Company’s shares from the open market, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is presented as shares held for share award scheme and deducted from total equity. No gain or loss is recognized on 
the transactions of the Company’s own shares.

162

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions (continued)
When the trustee transfers the Company’s shares to grantees upon vesting, the related costs of the granted shares vested are reversed 
from shares held under the share award scheme. Accordingly, the related expense of the granted shares vested is reversed from the 
employee share-based compensation reserve. The difference arising from this transfer is debited/credited to retained profits. At the end of 
the reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that are expected to ultimately vest. The impact of the revision 
of the estimate, if any, is recognized in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

Government Grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them 
and that the grants will be received. Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the 
Group recognized as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Retirement Benefit Schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme are charged as expenses when 
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

For defined benefit retirement benefits plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in 
the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in reserves and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss.

Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment or curtailment and a gain or loss on settlement is 
recognized when settlement occurs. When determining past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, an entity shall remeasure the net 
defined benefit liability or asset using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions, reflecting the benefits offered 
under the plan and the plan assets before and after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, without considering the effect of asset 
ceiling (i.e. the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan).

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. However, 
if the Group remeasures the net defined benefit liability or asset before plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, the Group determines 
net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using the benefits 
offered under the plan and the plan assets after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and the discount rate used to remeasure 
such net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period 
resulting from contributions or benefit payments.

Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows:

• 

• 

• 

service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

net interest expense or income; and

remeasurement.

The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in the line item administrative expenses under profit or loss. 
Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan 
amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability  
or asset.

The retirement benefit obligations recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

163

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 20193.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Short-term and other Long-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid as and when employees 
rendered the services. All short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense unless another HKFRS requires or permits the 
inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset.

A liability is recognized for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave) after deducting any 
amount already paid.

Liabilities recognized in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Any changes in the 
liabilities’ carrying amounts resulting from service costs, interests and remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent 
that another HKFRS requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset.

4.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors are required to make estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the estimates are revised if the revisions affect only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the 
revisions affect both current and future periods.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Estimated Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired requires an estimation of their recoverable 
amounts, which is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. As at 
December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are approximately US$580,866,000 
(2018: US$581,215,000) and approximately US$227,640,000 (2018: US$227,640,000) respectively. Details of the recoverable amount 
calculation are disclosed in Note 21. In determining whether the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired, 
the management takes into consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the cash-generating units. 
When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise and need to be recognized. 
Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and 
adjustments will be made in future periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Capitalization, Useful Lives and Estimated Impairment of Deferred Development Costs
Determining the development costs, including the time and costs for individual projects, to be capitalized requires estimations and 
assumptions based on the expected future economic benefits to be generated by the products resulting from these development costs. 
Other important estimations and assumptions in this assessment process are the feasibility of mass production, the distinction between 
research and development and the estimated useful life. As at December 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of deferred development costs 
of the Group are US$388,018,000 (2018: US$338,230,000). The estimation of their useful lives impacts the level of annual amortization 
recorded. The estimation of their useful lives reflects the directors’ best estimate of the periods that future economic benefits will be 
received through the use of the assets. In determining whether the deferred development costs are impaired, the management takes into 
consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the underlying projects, and the progress of these projects. 
When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise and need to be recognized. 
Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and 
adjustments will be made in future periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 20194.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates (continued)

Useful Lives and Impairment Assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment
PP&E are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and identified impairment losses. As at December 31, 2019, the Group’s carrying 
amount of PP&E is US$1,086,559,000 (2018: US$790,936,000). The estimation of their useful lives impacts the level of annual 
depreciation expense recorded. The estimated useful life of the equipment placed into production reflects the directors’ estimate of the 
periods that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of the Group’s PP&E. PP&E are evaluated for possible 
impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable. This process requires management’s estimate of 
future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets. For any instance where this evaluation process indicates impairment, the 
appropriate assets’ carrying values are written down to their recoverable amount and the amount of the write-down is charged against the  
results of operations.

Income Taxes
As at December 31, 2019, a deferred tax asset of approximately US$28,165,000 (2018: US$30,608,000) in relation to unused tax losses 
and approximately US$31,984,000 (2018: US$23,535,000) in relation to employee related provisions has been recognized in the Group’s 
consolidated statement of financial position. The realizability of the deferred tax asset mainly depends on whether sufficient taxable profits, 
or taxable temporary differences, will be available in the future. In cases where the actual future taxable profits generated are less than 
expected, a material reversal of the deferred tax asset may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which the 
reversal takes place. During the year, deferred tax assets of approximately US$2,563,000 (2018: US$3,326,000) in relation to unused tax 
losses were utilized.

Provision of ECL for Trade Receivables
The Group uses provision matrix to calculate ECL for the trade receivables. The provision rates are based on internal credit ratings as 
groupings of various debtors that have similar loss patterns. The provision matrix is based on the Group’s historical default rates taking into 
consideration forward-looking information that is reasonable and supportable available without undue costs or effort. At every reporting 
date, the historical observed default rates are reassessed and changes in the forward-looking information are considered.

The provision of ECL is sensitive to changes in estimates. The information about the ECL and the Group’s trade receivables are disclosed 
in Notes 37 and 25 respectively.

5.  Segment Information

Information about Major Customer
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Group’s largest customer contributed total revenue of US$3,586,339,000 
(2018: US$3,194,744,000), of which US$3,530,735,000 (2018: US$3,143,450,000) was under the Power Equipment segment and 
US$55,604,000 (2018: US$51,294,000) was under the Floor Care and Appliances segment. There is no other customer contributing 
more than 10% of total revenue.

6.  Revenue

Revenue represents the fair value of the net amounts received and receivable for goods sold by the Group to outside customers, less 
returns and allowances, and commission and royalty income received during the year and is analyzed as follows:

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized at a point in time. Commission and royalty income is recognized over time.

The Group sells products mainly to the wholesale market. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred, being when 
the goods have been shipped to the wholesaler’s specific location (delivery).

Following delivery, the wholesaler has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary 
responsibility when on selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.

Revenue is recognized for sales which are considered highly probable and that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized 
will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for sales in which revenue has not yet been recognized. The Group’s right to recover the 
product when customers exercise their right to return products is recognized as a right to returned goods asset and a corresponding 
adjustment to cost of sales.

As at December 31, 2019, revenue for unsatisfied contracts to be recognized by the Group over one year is immaterial. As permitted by 
HKFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied contracts for contracts with period of one year or less is not disclosed.

For both years, the Group leases land and buildings, office equipment, furniture and fixtures, plant and machinery, motor vehicles, aircraft 
and leasehold land for its operations. Lease contracts are entered into for term of up to 18 years. Certain leases of land and buildings, 
plant and machinery and fixtures and equipment were accounted for as finance leases during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 
carried interest ranged from 6.00% to 8.54%. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different 
terms and conditions. In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period, the Group applies the 
definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

Leases committed
As at December 31, 2019, the Group entered into new leases for certain PP&E that have not yet commenced, with average non-
cancellable period that range from 1 to 10 years with extension options, the total future undiscounted cash flows under which amounted 
to US$33,475,000 over the non-cancellable period.

Details of the lease maturity analysis of the lease liabilities are set out in Note 33.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 201920. Intangible Assets (continued)

The retailer and service relationships were acquired through business combinations which related to the relationships with retailers and 
service centers.

Deferred development costs are internally generated by capitalizing the costs pertaining to the development of new or enhancement of 
existing products.

Included in trademarks of the Group, US$227,640,000 (2018: US$227,640,000) are trademarks considered by the management of 
the Group as having indefinite useful lives because they are expected to contribute to the Group’s net cash inflows indefinitely. The 
trademarks will not be amortized until their useful lives are determined to be finite. Instead they will be tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Particulars of the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 21.

The above intangible assets, other than trademarks with indefinite useful lives, are amortized on a straight-line basis, at the following rates 
per annum:

Deferred development costs
Patents
Trademarks with finite useful lives
Manufacturing know-how
Retailer and service relationships

As explained in Note 5, the Group uses the types of goods sold for preparing the operating segment information. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives set out in Notes 19 and 20, the majority of the amounts have been 
allocated to five major individual cash-generating units (“CGUs”), including four units in the Power Equipment segment and one unit in 
the Floor Care and Appliances segment. The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks as at December 31, 2019 allocated to these 
units are as follows:

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended December 31, 201921. Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives (continued)

The basis of the recoverable amounts of the above CGUs and their major underlying assumptions are summarized below:

Power Equipment – MET (“MET”)
The recoverable amount of MET’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation 
uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period and a discount rate of 10.0% 
(2018: 10.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for MET are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on MET’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched, the success in  
reducing the working capital requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategy implemented by the Group. Cash flow projections 
beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 3.0% (2018: 3.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably 
possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of MET’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the 
recoverable amounts.

Power Equipment – HCP (“HCP”)
The recoverable amount of HCP’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation 
uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 11.0% 
(2018: 11.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for HCP are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on HCP’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the success of the 
cost cutting strategy implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth rate. 
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of HCP’s 
goodwill and intangibles to exceed the recoverable amounts.

Power Equipment – Drebo (“Drebo”)
The recoverable amount of Drebo’s goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 10.0% (2018: 11.0%) 
per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Drebo are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Drebo’s 
past performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the cost 
cutting strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a 1.0% (2018: 1.0%) growth rate. 
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Drebo’s 
goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

Power Equipment – Baja (“Baja”)
The recoverable amount of Baja’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 12.0% (2018: 
12.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Baja are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Baja’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development and the success of the cost cutting strategy implemented. Cash 
flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2018: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any 
reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Baja’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed 
the aggregate recoverable amounts.

181

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 201921. Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives (continued)

Floor Care and Appliances – RAM/Hoover/VAX (“RAM/Hoover/VAX”)
The recoverable amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate 
of 13.5% (2018: 14.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for RAM/Hoover/VAX are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows 
including sales, gross margin, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The assumptions and 
estimations are based on RAM/Hoover/VAX’s past performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success in 
reducing the working capital requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 
5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2018: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change 
in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the aggregate 
recoverable amounts.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and 
defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly. Trade receivables that are neither past 
due nor impaired have the best credit scoring attributable under the internal credit scoring system used by the Group.

As at December 31, 2019, included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with aggregate carrying amount of 
US$334,794,000 (2018: US$268,543,000) which are past due as at the reporting date. Of the past due balances, US$303,196,000 (2018: 
US$218,511,000) are not considered as in default as they are due from a number of independent customers that have a good payment 
track record with the Group.

The Group had a policy of allowing credit periods ranging mainly from 30 days to 120 days.

In accordance with receivables purchase agreements, certain trade receivables has been factored to banks (the “Factored Trade 
Receivables”). As the Group still retained the risks associated in respect of default payments, the Group has continued to recognize the 
Factored Trade Receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position. At the end of the reporting period, proceeds from the 
Factored Trade Receivables of approximately US$68,700,000 (2018: US$75,000,000) were recognized as liabilities and included in 
“Unsecured borrowings – due within one year” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swap
The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swap designated as highly effective hedging instrument to minimize its exposures to  
foreign currency and interest rate risk of its US$ bank borrowing by swapping the floating-rate US$ bank borrowing to fixed-rate EUR  
bank borrowing.

The cross-currency interest rate swap with notional amount of US$165,300,000 has fixed currency payments in EUR at exchange rate 
of EUR to US$ at 1.102, fixed interest payments monthly in EUR at 0.305% per annum for periods up until October 2023 and October 
2024.

The cross-currency interest rate swap and the corresponding bank borrowing have the same terms and the directors of the Company 
consider that the cross-currency interest rate swap is highly effective hedging instrument.

During the year, net adjustment on the above-mentioned cash flow hedges amounted to US$2,425,000 and is included in other  
comprehensive income.

The fair value of the cross-currency interest swap is determined by using the discounted cash flow method based on LIBOR yield curves 
and the forward exchange rates between US$ and EUR estimated at the end of the reporting period.

Major terms of the cross-currency interest rate swap were as follows:

36. Capital Risk Management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the  
return to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balances. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 
prior years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings, discounted bills with recourse and obligations under 
finance leases, net of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to Owners of the Company, comprising issued share capital, 
reserves and retained profits.

Gearing Ratio
The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the management considers the cost 
of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a target gearing ratio of not exceeding 35% determined as the 
proportion of net debt to equity. The Group will continue to execute very disciplined control and management of its working capital and 
generate free cash inflows through the growth of the business.

The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:

In addition, based on management recommendations, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of 
dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

37.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group’s corporate treasury function provides risk management advice to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic 
and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyze exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These financial risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group seeks to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments or natural hedges to mitigate these 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies is reviewed by the internal auditors on a 
continuous basis. The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

191

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 201937. Financial Instruments (continued)

37.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

37.2.1 Foreign Currency Risk Management

Subsidiaries of the Group have foreign currency sales and purchases, which exposes the Group to foreign currency risk. 
Approximately 21.0% (2018: 21.9%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the group entity making the sale, whilst almost 38.2% (2018: 47.2%) of purchases are denominated in the group entity’s 
respective functional currency.

The carrying amounts of certain significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Foreign Currency
EURO

Liabilities

Assets

2019
US$’000

2018
US$’000

US$’000

2018
US$’000

17,754

115,160

137,377

214,474

Note:  For group entities with their functional currency as the US$, monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars have no 

material foreign currency risk exposure as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged with the US$.

The Group requires its group entities to use foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the currency exposure. The 
foreign exchange forward contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. On this basis, the Group has entered 
into forward contracts in relation to the foreign currency amounting to US$660,461,000 (2018: US$357,800,000). It is the 
Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximize hedge 
effectiveness (see Note 28 for details).

Sensitivity Analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the effects of rate fluctuations in the EURO against US$.

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US$ against the EURO without 
considering the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap entered at end of the reporting 
period. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in the EURO:US$ foreign exchange rate. The 
sensitivity analysis includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and excludes the effect of any foreign 
currency forward contracts held at the reporting date. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit for the year 
where the US$ weakens 5% against the EURO.

37.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

37.2.2 Interest Rate Risk Management

The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section 
of this note. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate borrowing (see Note 38 for details 
of these borrowings), discounted bills with recourse, bank balances and deposits. The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk is 
mainly concentrated on London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) arising from the Group’s US$ and EURO denominated 
borrowings. In relation to interest bearing bank balances and deposits, the Group considers the interest rate risk to be low. 
The management continuously monitors interest rate fluctuations and will consider further hedging the interest rate risk 
should the need arise.

The Group is also exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to fixed-rate bank borrowings (see Note 38 for details of 
these borrowings) and lease liabilities.

During the year, the Group obtained new bank borrowings of US$4,042 million (2018: US$2,519 million) which are either at 
a fixed rate or LIBOR based. The proceeds were used for refinancing the Group’s borrowings.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments. 
The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding 
for the whole year without considering the cross-currency interest rate swaps entered at the end of the reporting period. A 50 
basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel 
and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s post-tax 
profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 would decrease/increase by US$6,120,000 (2018: decrease/increase by 
US$4,338,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate borrowings.

The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate 
debt instruments.

37.2.3 Other Price Risk

The Group is exposed to price risk through its financial assets at FVTPL.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to price risks of listed equity securities measured 
at fair value at the reporting date.

If the prices of the listed equity securities had been 10% higher, the profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 of the 
Group would increase by US$2,460,000 (2018: would increase by US$3,283,000) as a result of the changes in the fair 
values of financial assets at FVTPL.

37.2.4 Credit Risk Management and Impairment Assessment

As at December 31, 2019, other than those financial assets whose carrying amounts best represent the maximum exposure 
to credit risk of US$2,652,964,000 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the 
Group arising from the amount of financial guarantees provided by the Group is disclosed in Note 45. The Group does not 
hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit risk associated with its financial assets.

Trade receivables arising from contracts with customers
In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of 
credit limits and credit approvals. Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to 
assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to  
customers are reviewed twice a year. Other monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken 
to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group performs impairment assessment under ECL model upon application of 
HKFRS 9 based on provision matrix. In this regard, the directors of the Company consider that the Group’s credit risk is 
significantly reduced.

Bank balances
The credit risks on bank balances are limited because the counterparties are banks/financial institutions with high credit 
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group’s internal credit risk grading assessment comprises the following categories:

Internal credit rating

Description

Low risk

The counterparty has a low risk of default and 

does not have any past-due amounts.

US$37,635,000) respectively have no fixed repayment terms. The Group has assessed these balances on a 12-month ECL basis as there has 

been no significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition.

2. 

For trade receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach in HKFRS 9 to measure the loss allowance at lifetime ECL. The Group 

determines the expected credit losses on these items by using a provision matrix grouped by internal credit rating.

3. 

For financial guarantee contracts, the gross carrying amount represents the maximum amount the Group has guaranteed under the respective 

contracts.

The estimated loss rates are estimated based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the debtors and are 
adjusted for forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. The grouping is regularly reviewed by 
management to ensure relevant information about specific debtors is updated.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group provided US$34,529,000 (2018: US$51,760,000) for impairment 
allowances for trade receivables.

The Group writes off trade receivables when there is information indicating that the debtors are in severe financial difficulties 
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities.

As at December 31, 2019, the Group has available unutilized overdrafts facilities and short and medium term bank  
loan facilities of approximately US$345 million (2018: US$419 million) and US$1,506 million (2018: US$1,466  
million) respectively.

Liquidity Tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities as well as 
non-derivative financial assets which are included in the maturity analysis. For non-derivative financial assets, the tables have 
been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the undiscounted cash flow of the financial assets unless specified 
separately. For non-derivative financial liabilities, the tables reflect the undiscounted cash flow of financial liabilities based on 
the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the 
extent that the interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from the interest rate curve at the end of 
the reporting period. The inclusion of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the 
Group’s liquidity risk management as the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.

In addition, the following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual net cash inflows and (outflows) on derivative instruments that settle 
on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross inflows and (outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When 
the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the foreign currency exchange 
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The liquidity analysis for the Group’s derivative financial instruments are 
prepared based on the contractual maturities as the management considers that the contractual maturities are essential for 
an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.

37. Financial Instruments (continued)

37.2 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

37.2.5 Liquidity Risk Management (continued)

Liquidity Tables (continued)
The amounts included above for financial guarantee contracts are the maximum amounts the Group could be required to 
settle under the arrangement for the full guaranteed amount if that amount is claimed by the counterparty to the guarantee. 
Based on expectations at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that no amount 
will be payable under the arrangement. However, this estimate is subject to change depending on the probability of the 
counterparty claiming under guarantee which is a function of the likelihood that the financial receivables held by the 
counterparty which are guaranteed suffer credit losses.

The amount included above for variable interest rate instruments for non-derivative financial liabilities is subject to change if 
changes in variable interest rates differ to those estimates of interest rate determined at the end of the reporting period.

37.3 Fair Value

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contract;

the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap is measured by the present value of future cash flows estimated and 
discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and foreign exchange rates between US$ 
and EUR, which is observable at the end of the reporting period.

the fair value of financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with 
reference to quoted market bid prices or latest purchase/transaction prices; and

the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current  
market transactions.

Fair Value Measurements Recognized in the Statement of Financial Position
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The 
following table gives information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined (in 
particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used), as well as the level of the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value 
measurements are categorized (Levels 1 to 3) based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements  
are observable.

• 

• 

• 

Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities;

Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Group owns equity interest in a private company incorporated in the US that is classified as financial assets at FVTPL and is 
measured at fair value at the reporting date.

37.4 Transfers of financial assets

The following were the Group’s financial assets as at December 31, 2019 that were transferred to banks by discounting or factoring 
those trade and bills receivables on a full recourse basis. As the Group retained substantially all of the significant risks and rewards 
relating to these receivables, it continues to recognize the full carrying amount of the receivables and has recognized the cash 
received on the transfer as discounted bills with recourse (see Note 35) and unsecured borrowings – due within one year (see  
Note 38). These financial assets are carried at amortized cost in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.

The trade and bills receivables discounted with banks with full recourse at the year end was as follows:

41. Retirement Benefit Obligations
Defined Contribution Plans:
The Company and its subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong have participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (“MPF Schemes”) 
registered under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance since December 2000. The assets of the MPF Schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group, in funds under the control of trustees. The Group contributes 5% of relevant payroll cost to the MPF 
Schemes with a maximum amount of HK$18,000 (2018: HK$18,000) per employee per annum, which contribution is matched by  
the employee.

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are members of a state-managed retirement benefit 
scheme operated by the PRC government. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the 
retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make 
the specified contributions.

The Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes 
applicable to each year are made at a certain percentage of the employees’ payroll.

The total expense recognized in profit or loss of US$14,341,000 (2018: US$12,167,000) represents contributions payable to these plans 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Defined Benefits Plans:
The Group operates several defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Germany and the US, of which these 
plans cover substantially all remaining employees that are not covered by defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plan is 
administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number 
of representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its articles of 
association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, employers. The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The major 
defined benefit plans are as follows:

Pension plan obligations (Note i)
Post-retirement, medical and dental plan obligations (Note ii)
Life and medical insurance plan (Note ii)
Post-employment benefit plan obligations (Note iii)
Others (Note iv)

Note i:  Pension plan obligations

The pension plan obligations are provided in the German operations and includes a plan that pays retirement benefits on service and final pay. In general, the 

benefit plans were closed to new members at the end of 1995. Under the plan, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 10% and 20% 

of final salary (based on the average of the last three years) on attainment of a retirement age of 65. The most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of 

the defined benefit obligations were carried out on January 1, 2020, by BDO AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, Germany, an independent valuer not related 

to the Group.

Note ii: Post-retirement, medical and dental plan obligations/Life and medical insurance plan

Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the US, operates unfunded post-retirement, medical benefits, dental and life insurance plans. 

The most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of the obligations were carried out on January 3, 2019 by Willis Towers Watson, an independent valuer 

not related to the Group.

Note iii: Post-employment benefit plan obligations

The pension plan obligations are provided by Hoover Inc. for members of IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) Local 1985 employed by 

Hoover. The most recent actuarial valuation of the present value of the obligations were carried out on January 9, 2020 by CBIZ Benefits & Insurance Services, 

an independent valuer not related to the Group.

Note iv: Others

Others mainly includes the a long-term incentive benefit that is offered to certain management executives of the Group. The benefit is based on the performance 

of the executives and will pay out after certain year of services.

The plans in Germany and the US expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and  
salary risk.

Investment risk

Interest rate risk

Longevity risk

Salary risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference 
to high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality 
of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan 
participants will increase the plan’s liability.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependents of plan members (widow and orphan benefits) is reinsured by an external 
insurance company.

The main actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

Post-retirement
medical and dental plan

Life & medical 
insurance plan

The plan assets of the post-employment benefit plan are cash and cash equivalents in a Federated Money Market Fund with an expected 
return of 4.14% (2018: 3.46%).

The actual return on plan assets was US$168,000 (2018: US$191,000).

The significant actuarial assumption for the determination of the defined obligation is the discount rate. If the discount rate is 100 basis 
points higher (lower), the effect on defined benefit obligation would be immaterial.

The Group expects to make a contribution of US$4,700,000 (2018: US$Nil) to the defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group has unused tax losses of US$1,737 million (2018: US$1,611 million) available for offset 
against future taxable profits. Of the US$1,737 million of unused losses approximately US$447 million expire over the next 9 to 18 years 
with the remaining loss carryforwards having no useful life limitation. No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of tax losses of 
US$1,615 million (2018: US$1,475 million) due to the lack of probable future taxable profits.

In respect of all unrepatriated foreign earnings, the Group has provided deferred taxes of US$13 million (2018: US$13 million) as these 
unrepatriated foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested.

Scheme Option Schemes
The Company has two share option schemes in place – Scheme D and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired 
on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, 
Scheme E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the eligible 
persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal terms 
of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:

(i) 

employees; or

(ii)  Directors; or

(iii)  secondees; or

(iv)  any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued by 

any member of the Group; or

(v)  business partners; or

(vi)  suppliers; or

(vii)  customers; or

(viii)  advisers of the Group.

Share options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by the 
Board for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at any time, subject to vesting conditions from the date of grant to the tenth 
anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share option; 
or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading days 
immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options may be granted under the respective share option scheme is not 
permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time or 10.0% of shares in issue as at the adoption 
date of the respective share option scheme. No person shall be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as at the 
date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first or second anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of (i) the 
closing price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant; and (ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant.

1.507%

The share options are vested in parts over 1 to 2 years from the date of grant.

Expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioral considerations.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the volatility of the share price. 
Because changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the directors’ opinion, the existing model 
does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the share options.

The weighted average closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the date on which the share options were granted during 
2019 was HK$50.15 (2018: HK$48.50).

The closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the date on which the share options were granted was HK$50.15 in 2019 
(2018: HK$48.50).

215

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 201946. Share Options (continued)

The weighted average closing prices of the Company’s shares immediately before various dates during 2019 and 2018 on which the share 
options were exercised were HK$55.67 and HK$46.63 respectively.

The Group recognized a total expense of US$2,636,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2018: US$2,634,000) in relation to 
share options granted by the Company.

The fair value of the share options granted in 2019 measured at the date on which the share options were granted was HK$12.69 (2018: 
HK$11.82). The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in 2019 was HK$12.69 (2018: HK$11.82) per option.

The Company had 10,457,500 share options outstanding (2018: 12,163,500), which represented approximately 0.57% (2018: 0.67%) 
of the issued share capital of the Company as at December 31, 2019. No option (2018: Nil) was cancelled and 50,000 (2018: 25,000) 
share options were lapsed during the year.

Total securities available for issue under Scheme D are 150,505,065 shares, which represented approximately 8.22% of the issued 
shares of the Company as at December 31, 2019. Total securities available for issue under Scheme E are 183,299,194 shares, which 
represented approximately 10.02% of the issued shares of the Company as at December 31, 2019.

47. Share Award Scheme

The purpose of the share award scheme is to recognize the contributions by certain eligible persons and to provide them with incentives in 
order to retain them for the continual operation and development of the Group and to attract suitable personnel for further development of 
the Group.

The share award scheme of the Company was adopted by the Board of Directors on January 9, 2008 and renewed on January 17, 2018. 
The Board may from time to time at their absolute discretion select any eligible person for participation in the scheme as a selected 
grantee and determine the number of shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The Board must cause to be paid 
to the trustee the purchase price and the related expenses. The trustee must either purchase shares from the market or subscribe for 
new shares. The trustee must hold the shares until they are vested in accordance with the scheme rules. When the selected grantee 
has satisfied all vesting conditions specified by the Board at the time of making the award and becomes entitled to the shares forming 
the subject of the award, the trustee will transfer the relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of accrued 
interest) to the selected grantee.

An award of shares automatically lapses when, (i) a selected grantee who is an employee ceases to be an employee; or (ii) the subsidiary 
by which a selected grantee is employed ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company (or of a member of the Group); or (iii) a selected 
grantee who is a Director of the Company or a subsidiary ceases to be a director of the same; or (iv) an order for the winding-up of the 
Company is made or a resolution is passed (otherwise than for certain purposes) for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, and, in any 
such case, the award, unless the Board otherwise agrees, automatically lapses forthwith and all the awarded shares and related income of 
such award do not vest on the relevant vesting date but become returned shares for the purpose of the scheme.

Recognition of share-based payment expenses under the share award scheme during the year was US$4,156,000 (2018: US$2,344,000). 
During 2019, 451,000 shares (2018: 160,500 shares) were transferred to the awardees upon vesting.

54. Subsequent Event

The outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) in PRC and the subsequent quarantine measures imposed by the PRC 
government has had an impact on the Group’s operation in China. The Group had to suspend its manufacturing activities since late 
January 2020 due to mandatory government quarantine measures in an effort to contain the spread of the epidemic. The Group has 
resumed its manufacturing activities since early February 2020 and is already at approximately 70% capacity as at the date hereof.

The directors of the Company are monitoring the financial impact that the COVID-19 will have on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements as at the date that these financial statements are authorized for issue.
