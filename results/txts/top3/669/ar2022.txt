Chairman’s Statement

I am pleased to announce that 2021  
was an extraordinary year for TTI with 
outstanding revenue and profit growth.

We delivered sales of US$13.2 billion, an increase of 34.6%.  
Over the two-year period, we significantly outperformed the market 
with +72.2% sales growth. Increased strategic investments in new 
product, manufacturing capacity, geographic expansion, logistics,  
and our in-field marketing initiatives propelled our industry  
leading performance.

Every one of our business units in all geographic regions delivered 
exceptional sales growth in 2021. North America grew 33.7%, Europe 
grew 41.1% and ROW grew 31.8%. Our Power Equipment business, 
representing 90.6% of total sales, grew 37.0% to US$12.0 billion.  
Our Milwaukee business, Ryobi DIY, and Ryobi Outdoor businesses  
all achieved double-digit growth, significantly outgrowing the market. 
Our Floorcare and Cleaning business also produced strong sales 
growth of 14.8% to US$1.2 billion.

Gross margin improved for the 13th consecutive year, from 38.3%  
in 2020 to 38.8% in 2021. This gross margin improvement is a direct 
result of the launching of high margin new products, disciplined mix 
management, exceptional productivity gains, and volume leverage.

Our team has done a masterful job managing through the evolving 
supply chain landscape. With the help of key long-term suppliers,  
we have navigated through increased in-transit times and limited 
transportation availability to keep serving customers at a high level. 
Additionally, our bold decision to invest in inventory has created  
a buffer of critical components to keep production lines running 
smoothly and insulating the business from commodity cost increases.

We are deeply committed to being a global leader in clean tech 
innovation, environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and 
ethical corporate governance. Throughout 2021, we continued to

“	We	are	confident	that	our	unrelenting	bold	vision,	
customer	focus	and	business	momentum	will	 
make	2022	another	outstanding	year	and	position	
TTI	with	exciting	opportunities	in	the	months	and	
years	ahead.”

invest relentlessly in the development of environmentally responsible 
cordless products that reduce carbon and noise pollution and are  
safer for end users, while investing in decarbonizing our manufacturing 
operations. This year we are pleased to announce that we are 
committing to reducing our 2030 SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 absolute 
emissions by 60% from our 2021 baseline, not only reducing carbon 
intensity, but doing so while growing our business.

Financial Performance
EBIT increased 37.2% to US$1.2 billion, with the EBIT margin 
improving by 17 basis points to 9.0%. Net Profit rose 37.2% to 
US$1.1 billion, with earnings per share increasing 37.1% over 2020 
to US60.04 cents. With the investments in inventory to support sales 
growth and high service levels, the Group maintained a disciplined 
working capital ratio at 20.9% of sales.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of HK 1 dollar 
(approximately US12.87 cents) per share. Together, with the  
interim dividend of HK85.00 cents (approximately US10.94 cents)  
per share, this will result in a full-year dividend of HK185.00 cents 
(approximately US23.81 cents) per share, against HK135.00 cents 
(approximately US17.37 cents) per share in 2020, an increase  
of 37.0%.

Outlook
TTI is now uniquely positioned to continue our leadership position in 
professional cordless, DIY cordless, outdoor cordless, and in floorcare. 
In 2021, we made bold investments to expand manufacturing capacity, 
new product development, marketing, end user conversion, geographic 
expansion, and inventory to support our 34.6% sales growth. In 2022, 
we are excited to continue making substantial investments in the 
business, to drive another year of above market results and gross 
margin expansion.

I would like to thank our customers, end users, suppliers, shareholders, 
and entire TTI organization for another tremendous year. These 
outstanding results are a testament to the quality of our dedicated, 
skilled, and passionate world-class teams across the globe. We are 
confident that our unrelenting bold vision, customer focus and 
business momentum will make 2022 another outstanding year and 
position TTI with exciting opportunities in the months and years ahead.

Chief Executive Officer’s Message

2021 was an epic year for TTI, with 
organic sales growth of $3.4 billion.  
Not only did we grow the business by 
34.6%, but we did so while improving 
gross margin and net profit at a faster 
rate than sales. Our unwavering strategic 
focus on cordless technology drove  
this extraordinary performance.

We are leading the once-in-a-generation shift from petrol,  
corded, manual, hydraulic, and pneumatic products to cordless  
in power tools, light equipment, outdoor products, and cleaning.  
Our technologically advanced cordless products command a premium 
in the market, which drives our continued gross margin improvement. 
2021 was the 13th consecutive year of gross margin improvement, 
funding additional strategic SG&A investments in R&D, new product 
development, in-field marketing specialists, digital marketing, store 
coverage, and geographic expansion. This virtuous cycle of gross 
margin improvement and strategic SG&A reinvestment to drive sales 
and gross margin improvement is a core strategy that has allowed us 
to consistently deliver on our commitment of outgrowing the market 
while improving our financial performance. 

Powerful Brands
In addition to delivering spectacular results in 2021, I have  
never been more optimistic about the future growth engines of  
the company. MILWAUKEE is the number one and fastest-growing 
global brand in the professional tool market, while RYOBI is the 
number one DIY tool and cordless outdoor power equipment brand 
worldwide. We have also expanded our best-in-class offering of 
MILWAUKEE professional cordless outdoor equipment, which is now 
the fastest-growing brand of cordless professional-grade outdoor 
products for landscapers and lawn and garden enthusiasts.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MESSAGE

“	While	we	are	pleased	with	our	2021	
performance,	we	firmly	believe	the	 
next	five	years	will	be	a	tremendous	period	
for	company’s	sales	and	profit	growth.”

Cordless Leadership
We are laser-focused on developing advanced, demonstrably better 
and technologically superior cordless products. Our development 
process is driven by the end user’s needs from start to finish. As an 
example, when developing our new flagship RYOBI 80V HP Zero-Turn 
Riding Mower, we started from a blank canvas rather than working  
to “electrify” an existing petrol-powered product. This allowed us to 
optimize each critical component of the mower to maximize power 
and performance while adding new innovative features. 

In addition to developing one runaway successful product after 
another, the network effect of our interchangeable battery systems 
compounds our growth trajectory. Every additional product we add  
to the system increases the value of the entire platform to our end 
customer. For example, the flagship MILWAUKEE M18 platform now 
has 251 products that run off the same M18 battery and is rapidly 
growing. This is attractive to new customers who gain access to a  
wide range of tools that run off the same powerful battery. It also 
creates a loyal customer base with access to a continuous stream  
of new products available as bare tools powered by batteries they 
already own. This is a key tenant of our cordless strategy and is 
deployed across all our TTI battery platforms.

Supply Chain Investments
In 2021, we continued to make bold investments in additional 
manufacturing capacity to support our future growth. Construction  
is currently underway on greenfield manufacturing sites in the US  
and Vietnam while we continue to invest in our world-class existing 
facilities across Asia, North America, and Europe. Our expanding 
global manufacturing footprint allows us to produce high-quality 
products with the flexibility to quickly react to changing environmental 
and geopolitical factors. All TTI sites worldwide adhere to the  
TTI OPEX philosophy of delivering world-class quality, driving 
increased productivity, and maintaining best-in-class service  
levels for our customers.

We have also strategically partnered with key suppliers to develop the 
latest technology. These close partnerships allow us to deliver on our 
internal mandate of disrupting our core products with next-generation 
models that have more power, compactness, longer life, or a multitude 
of other features. Our strategic suppliers did a magnificent job 
delivering advanced technology and steady component supply 
throughout 2021.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MESSAGE

Exceptional People
We continued with our aggressive hiring plans in 2021, adding 
another 2,031 high-potential college graduates to our Leadership 
Development Program (LDP). Since its beginning over 14 years ago, 
this program has supported our growth by creating a pipeline of  
future leaders across the engineering, sales, marketing, purchasing, 
supply chain, manufacturing, and finance disciplines. Software  
and electronics engineering is an especially high focus, as we have 
augmented our R&D powerhouse with newly recruited engineers  
who drive technological advancements and accelerate the pace  
of our new product launches.

In addition to bolstering our workforce with high-potential college 
graduates, we’ve focused on further developing our high-performance 
culture across all levels and functions of the organization. The depth 
of our team has never been more impressive, with many of our LDP 
graduates leading functions across the organization with increasing 
levels of responsibility. The deep commitment and dedication of our 
highly talented team to users, customers, and distribution partners 
across the globe is a competitive advantage that powers our growth.

Geographic Expansion Success
Our breathtaking growth in the European theater exemplifies  
the power of our world-class management team. We have gone  
from a very small presence in Europe to a commanding cordless 
leadership and growth position. The European team’s success is  
a great example of the company’s ability to continue to grow outside 
the core US market. In addition to Europe, we have been able to 
achieve incredibly strong growth levels in Canada, Mexico, Australia/
New Zealand, and Asia. I am enormously impressed by the quality  
of our world-class team across the globe.

Sustainability
Our mission is to lead the industry in clean tech innovation, 
environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical 
corporate governance. Sustainability best practices are embedded  
in all layers of the organization and across all functions. This year,  
we committed to reducing our absolute SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 60% in 2030. Our team has 
rallied around this commitment and has started making excellent 
progress towards our goal. For example, we recently committed to  
a green energy initiative in the State of Wisconsin, powering our  
sites in the area with electricity generated from clean sources. 

10

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

Another one of our leadership initiatives in sustainability is developing 
carbon and noise pollution-free battery-powered outdoor products. 
RYOBI has led the revolution away from noisy, petrol-powered  
outdoor equipment with a fleet of battery-powered lawn mowers, 
battery-powered snow blowers, and cordless handheld outdoor 
equipment. We have also launched a premium line of MILWAUKEE 
battery-powered professional-grade outdoor equipment, led by  
the flagship MILWAUKEE M18 FUEL 21” Self-Propelled Dual  
Battery Mower.

From raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations, supply chain, 
transportation, and new product development, I am incredibly proud 
of how our team has developed a core competency in sustainability. 
We firmly believe that our ability to grow as a company is closely 
linked to our ESG performance.

The Best is Yet to Come
In 2021, we dramatically outpaced the market and strengthened  
our global leadership position. Our bold investments in new product 
development, manufacturing, logistics, geographic expansion,  
and in-field marketing initiatives drove our growth and extended  
our position as industry leaders. While we are pleased with our  
2021 performance, we firmly believe the next five years will be  
a tremendous period for the company’s sales and profit growth.

I want to thank our Chairman, Horst Pudwill, and Vice-Chairman, 
Stephan Pudwill for their bold leadership and unwavering support.  
We share a vision for sustainable global cordless dominance, and  
I am proud of being a part of a team that consistently outperforms  
the market. This is just the beginning of our journey, and I am 
confident that the best is yet to come.

It all starts with the user. We don’t make assumptions. Instead, we set  
out to deliver disruptive innovation by getting out on the jobsite, alongside 
trade professionals, to understand their challenges – the frustrations,  
the needs, and previous limitations. We set out to completely rethink a 
solution with new-to-world technology and unparalleled levels of design 
and engineering. Whether it’s bringing cordless power to traditionally 
corded or gas products and manual activities, or advances to fundamental 
tools and equipment, MILWAUKEE’s focus is on working directly with 
users to help improve their productivity and safety.

most diverse cordless cleaning portfolio in the category.  
From vacuums to spot cleaners to wet/dry vacuums, all 
cordless cleaning tools in the HOOVER portfolio works with 
the same ONEPWR interchangeable lithium-ion battery.  
So, for the user, switching from one task to another is as 
simple as switching the battery from one product to another. 
And with multiple batteries, users can always have at least 
one powerful battery charging while one is in use.

ONEPWR Means Many Options

The HOOVER Cordless System is powered by innovative, 
lithium-ion ONEPWR batteries available in several size,  
power and runtime options. The versatile ONEPWR batteries 
allow pairing the right size battery with the right products to  
fit customers’ cleaning habits. Where an 8Ah battery helps 
extend the runtime of a cordless vacuum, the lightweight  
2Ah battery is more appropriate for a hand vacuum. The true 
benefit to the customer is owning multiple HOOVER cordless 
products and multiple ONEPWR batteries for extensive 
cleaning and runtime options.

Power Equipment
Our Power Equipment segment delivered sales growth of 37.0% to US$12.0 billion.  
We grew operating profit 37.8% to US$1.2 billion while making investments to extend  
our leadership position in the Professional and DIY Tool markets. Based on the wide 
international reach of our brands, we believe MILWAUKEE is the #1 global Professional 
Tool brand, and RYOBI is the #1 DIY Tool brand worldwide. More importantly, both 
MILWAUKEE and RYOBI are the clear leaders in the cordless market, with a commanding 
and growing global position.

MILWAUKEE
In 2021, we grew our flagship Milwaukee business 40.6%. The introduction of innovative 
new products to expand our industry leading M18 and M12 cordless product platforms led 
this growth. In addition, the breakthrough MILWAUKEE MX FUEL Light Equipment platform 
continued to gain traction. We also expanded our existing line up of power tool accessories, 
PACKOUT storage solutions, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Mechanics Hand 
Tools. These new product introductions, combined with our focus on end user conversions 
and strong commercial execution, continue to propel the outstanding growth momentum 
of this business.

Power Tools
Our Milwaukee business continued to convert users from traditional power sources 
including corded, pneumatic, hydraulic and petrol tools to our lithium cordless battery 
technology. Leading the way is the MILWAUKEE M18 system with 251 tools on the 
platform, the M12 system with 139 tools and the MX FUEL range with 13 products.

After we introduce a key new product, we immediately focus on engineering the  
next generation with additional features, improved run-time, power, speed, life, and 
compactness. In 2021, we launched 8 next generation MILWAUKEE M18 products 
including SDS Plus Rotary Hammers, Small Angle Grinders, and Finish Nailers.

We also expanded the MILWAUKEE M12 sub compact cordless platform with a series of 
innovative tools. One of the highlights includes the M12 FUEL High Speed Ratchet, which 
allow users to increase their productivity and is selling at rates well beyond expectations.

The M18 FUEL 16” Chainsaw

Outdoor Products
We identified a vast opportunity to transform outdoor power equipment from petrol to  
battery-powered. To capitalize on this opportunity, we created a business unit that strictly 
focuses on battery-powered outdoor products. Our obsession is to catalyze a stampede away 
from petrol to battery, to improve the performance of outdoor products while eliminating 
carbon emissions and reducing noise. MILWAUKEE is well positioned to lead this revolution  
for professional grade outdoor equipment by introducing best in class performance through 
advanced batteries, charging, motor design and most importantly, firmware. In 2022, we will 
launch our new MILWAUKEE M18 FUEL 21” Self-Propelled battery-powered mower that delivers 
a breakthrough mowing performance, while also achieving new levels of sustainability and 
noise reduction. Fortunately, MILWAUKEE is not burdened with a legacy petrol business, so the 
entire product development system is 100% focused on leadership battery-powered products.

Storage
In addition, we continue to expand our revolutionary MILWAUKEE PACKOUT storage system  
to meet the growing storage, transportation, and organizational needs of the professional user. 
With the recent additions of the PACKOUT deep organizer, rolling jobsite box, and XL toolbox, 
this innovative system now contains 45 interchangeable products.

comfort, safety, and productivity to our users. The flagship of our new PPE product range is

High Performance (HP) brushless products elevated the performance of RYOBI, providing

The Ryobi outdoor business delivered another year of outstanding results, led by our global 
leadership of battery-powered lawn mowers, battery-powered snow blowers, and cordless 
handheld outdoor equipment. Our range of 41 cordless RYOBI mowers and 6 snow blowers 
are leading the revolution from the legacy petrol market to our environmentally friendly lithium 
cordless technology. In addition to being carbon-emission free in use, these products offer 
superior performance, increasing levels of power without any of the harmful carbon emissions 
and noise.

One of our leadership initiatives at TTI is attacking noise pollution. Awareness of this harmful 
issue is growing as local governments are increasingly enacting legislation restricting the use  
of loud petrol powered outdoor equipment. We are the global leader in acoustic engineering 
and the subsequent reduction of noise in outdoor products. For example, our RYOBI WHISPER 
series of quiet blowers, mowers, chainsaws, and other outdoor equipment represents a 
breakthrough in sound reduction on outdoor battery products that delivers incredible power 
without the noise. We are incredibly excited about the revolutionary research MILWAUKEE  
is doing in acoustic engineering for the new product pipeline.

as compared to US$2,896 million in 2020, representing 29.9%  
of turnover (2020: 29.5%). The increase was mainly due to the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Financial Review

Liquidity And Financial Resources
Shareholders’ Funds
Total shareholders’ funds amounted to US$4.7 billion as compared  
to US$3.9 billion in 2020. Book value per share was at US$2.57  
as compared to US$2.13 last year, an increase of 20.7%.

Financial Position
The Group continued to maintain a strong financial position.  
As at December 31, 2021, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents 
amounted to US$1,874 million (2020: US$1,534 million), of which 
55.3%, 12.1%, 10.7%, and 21.9% were denominated in US$,  
RMB, EUR and other currencies respectively.

The Group’s net gearing, expressed as a percentage of total net 
borrowing (excluding bank advance from factored trade receivables 
which are without recourse in nature) to equity attributable to Owners 
of the Company, was at 28.2% as compared to net cash in 2020.

Bank Borrowings
Long term borrowings accounted for 32.1% of total debts  
(2020: 71.4%).

The Group’s major borrowings continued to be in US Dollars. 
Borrowings are predominantly LIBOR based. There is a natural hedge 
mechanism in place as the Group’s major revenues are in US Dollars 
and currency exposure therefore is low. Currency, interest rate 
exposures, and cash management functions are all being closely 
monitored and managed by the Group’s treasury team.

Amongst the bank borrowings, fixed rate debts account for 23.0%  
of the total bank borrowings, the balance being floating rate debts.

Working Capital
Total inventory was at US$4,850 million as compared to  
US$3,224 million in 2020. Days inventory increased by  
14 days from 120 days to 134 days. The higher inventory  
days as compared to past years was mainly due to the strategic 
decision to carry a higher level of inventory to support our service  
level in considering our high growth momentum, to buffer inflation  
risk and critical component shortage. The Group will continue to  
focus on managing the inventory level and improve inventory turns.

Trade receivable turnover days were at 53 days as compared to  
48 days last year. Excluding the gross up of the receivables factored 
which is without recourse in nature, receivable turnover days were at 
50 days as compared to 47 days last year. The Group is comfortable 
with the quality of the receivables and will continue to exercise due 
care in managing the credit exposure.

Trade payable days were 110 days as compared to 117 days in 2020 
as the Group managed to leverage the volume and order visibility for 
better trade terms from suppliers.

Working capital as a percentage of sales was at 20.9% as compared 
to 14.0% in 2020.

Capital Expenditure 
Total capital expenditures for the year amounted to US$747 million 
(2020: US$459 million).

Capital Commitments and Guarantees
As at December 31, 2021, total capital commitments for the 
acquisition of property, plant and equipment contracted for but not 
provided amounted to US$235 million (2020: US$104 million), and 
there were no material guarantees or off balance sheet obligations.

that focuses on “Powerful brands, Innovative Products,  
Operational Excellence and Exceptional People”.

We continue to strengthen our portfolio of powerful brands with a 
focused marketing approach. Brands extension into new product 
categories and under-represented markets enable us to generate 
outstanding growth. Geographic expansion will be a highlight of  
TTI’s future, our long term strategy is to aggressively build our 
business both inside and outside North America and we have  
spent relentless efforts to expand and establish presence in high 
potential markets around the world.

Human Resources
The Group employed a total of 51,426 employees as at  
December 31, 2021 (2020: 48,028) in Hong Kong and  
overseas. Total staff cost for the year under review amounted  
to US$2,207 million (2020: US$1,584 million).

Introducing innovative new products is the centerpiece of our long 
term strategy. We continue to invest in building a high-speed  
product development process, enabling us to respond faster  
to customer requests and emerging opportunities, giving us  
a vigorous competitive advantage.

The Group regards human capital as vital for the Group’s continuous 
growth and profitability and remains committed to improving the 
quality, competence and skills of all employees. It provides job-related 
training and leadership development programs throughout the 
organization. The Group continues to offer competitive remuneration 
packages, discretionary share options and bonuses to eligible staff,

SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS

TTI’s ESG Approach and Strategic Framework
At TTI, sustainability is a core value in all aspects of our business. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles are essential  
to our strategy, and embedded in our four strategic drivers, through 
which we strive to deliver shared value to all our stakeholders. TTI 
understands the importance of continuous engagement with our 
stakeholders to monitor and address their expectations as well as 
evolving legal and industry requirements. Our mission is to shape a 
better future, at the heart of which is our relentless focus on cordless 
technology and products to improve living and working environments.

Our Powerful Brands represent a long legacy of developing innovative, 
reliable and safe products, that address the evolving demands of 
consumers. By channeling resources into creating Innovative Products, 
we are leading the transition from corded, gas, hydraulic and 
pneumatic-powered products to cordless battery-powered alternatives, 
removing the unfavorable impact of outdated technologies. TTI’s 
ongoing and future success is driven by our Exceptional People.  
Hiring the right people and fostering and retaining them through our 
Leadership Development Program is at the heart of our strategy. TTI is 
committed to a multicultural, diverse and inclusive workplace where our 
employees at every level can flourish while building a better future for 
our business, our customers and the communities where we operate. 
Through our Operational Excellence we uphold high standards of 
integrity across the value chain. We ensure responsible and disciplined 
execution — whether it be in decarbonizing our operations, preserving 
natural capital, sourcing ethically and optimizing supply chain logistics, 
or managing the repairability and the end-of-life cycle of our products.

In 2021, we continued to make progress on partnerships and  
initiatives that matter. Beyond aligning to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and continuing our 
membership with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), we began 
reporting against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
Standards and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), while also prioritizing our 
decarbonization agenda. As a founding member of the Better Mining 
Initiative (BMI) and active member of the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA), we have forged ahead to collaborate with industry 
partners to effect change on crucial challenges in our supply chain.

At TTI we strive to manage our environmental impact  
by prioritizing the responsible development of our 
Innovative Products. We are dedicated to fully integrating  
diligent environmental management into our business;  
as such all our manufacturing sites have comprehensive 
Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in place. Our 
commitment to increasing transparency and accountability 
throughout our value chain is evident in our approach to 
climate action, responsible sourcing, managing resources, 
materials and waste, and developing sustainable products. 

Our priority in 2021 has largely been to accelerate our 
course towards decarbonization and to that end we have 
also embarked on a comprehensive exercise to analyze  
our climate risks. We have pledged to reduce our GHG 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 60% by 2030 against  
our baseline year of 2021, and have formulated a clear 
roadmap to achieving our target. We have also continued 
to strategically invest in clean technologies and developing 
products that have more sustainable attributes. 
Furthermore, we are implementing circularity practices 
across aspects of our operations and value chain.  
To ensure that all our BUs are unified in continually 
improving performance and sustainability practices,  
we have established a number of key procedures and 
accountability mechanisms.

TTI has long valued the role of Exceptional People in our 
business. We are building a strong, diverse and inclusive 
culture with a shared set of beliefs supported by strategy, 
structure and communication.

At all levels, we strive to attract and retain talented people,

fostering connections between colleagues and leaders has 
been vital in 2021, particularly while many employees 
continued to work from home. Providing comprehensive 
professional development opportunities, in the form of our 
Leadership Development Program and other such initiatives 
has also remained important as we nurture our people to 
further innovation and productivity. In addition, protection 
of our people is a priority as we strive to maintain workplace 
conditions that are safe and healthy. Safety is also a key 
consideration when it comes to our products. We continue 
to enhance product safety, quality and reliability while 
focusing on reducing the inherent impact of outdated 
technologies such as noise and air pollution, to provide 
customers with the best and safest experience.

TTI continues to support programs that improve livelihoods 
within our communities. In 2021, our focus was on 
activities that address good health and wellbeing, human 
rights and poverty alleviation, infrastructure development 
and the reduction of inequality. Our community initiatives 
involve collaboration with non-governmental organizations

resources provided by the Company and/or independent professional 
advice when necessary, included:
• 

review of the size, composition and structure of the Board on a 
regular basis.
• 
review the Nomination Policy and the Board Diversity Policy.
•  assess the independence of Independent Non-executive Directors.
•  make recommendations to the Board on relevant matters relating 
to the retirement and re-election of the Directors at the 2021 
Annual General Meeting.

The Board has a balance of skills, experience and diversity of 
perspectives to enhance the Company’s business and values. The 
Board has adopted the Board Diversity Policy in August 2013, which 
is published on the Company’s website (www.ttigroup.com). Widening 
diversity at the Board level is essential for sustainable development 
of the Group. The Nomination Committee would consider various 
perspectives, including, but not limited to, age, gender, professional 
experience, educational background, cultural and length of service 
while reviewing the composition of the Board. An analysis of the 
current Board composition based on these objective criteria is set out 
on page 71 of this report.

The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include, but 
not limited to, developing and administering a fair and transparent 
procedure for setting policy on the overall human resources strategy of 
the Group and the remuneration of Directors and senior management 
of the Group, and determining their remuneration packages, on 
the basis of their merit, competence and qualifications, and having 
regard to individual performance, the Company’s operating results 
and return to shareholders, and comparable market statistics. The 
Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board 
on the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and senior 
management, including, without limitation, base salaries, benefits 
in kind, incentive payments and grants, and consults the Chairman 
and/or Chief Executive Officer for the proposals of other Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages. The Remuneration Committee also 
makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of  
Non-executive Directors and Independent Non-executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee reports directly to the Board on its 
decisions or recommendations and with access to sufficient resources 
and professional advice if necessary.

The Remuneration Committee held three meetings in 2021 and 
performed, among other work, the following:
• 

review and make recommendations on the existing Remuneration 
Policy for Directors and senior management.

•  assess the Executive Directors’ performance and remuneration 

packages.

The Group engages a global executive compensation consulting 
firm as an independent third party to assess the competitiveness 
of compensation of the Chairman, the CEO and other Executive 
Directors. The compensation packages of the Group’s Executive 
Directors were assessed relative to similar positions at 20 peer 
companies operating in the same or adjacent industries. The 
consultant’s assessment took into account the Group’s absolute 
share price, financial and operational performance, as well as that 
performance relative to the peer companies.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORTGROUP CEO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
The Remuneration Committee reviewed and recommended to the 
Board for approval the 2021 incentive payouts for the Chairman, 
the CEO and other Executive Directors commensurate with the 
exceptional financial and operational performance delivered by the 
Group in a difficult operating environment, including supply chain 
disruptions and the ongoing health and social effects of the global 
Covid pandemic.

Executive compensation, and especially the Group CEO’s 
compensation, is dependent on company performance as measured 

by a number of operational and financial metrics. In particular, the 
Remuneration Committee believes it is extremely important to align 
executive compensation with the interests of shareholders. As shown 
in Chart 1 below, over the past five years the Group has exceeded the 
75th percentile performance of the 20 peer companies in a number 
of key financial and operational performance metrics including 
revenue growth, EBIT growth, diluted EPS growth, and gross profit 
margin improvement. Importantly, the Company’s stock price and 
TSR performance over the past five years has been exceptional in 
both relative and absolute terms, with the Company’s 5-year TSR 
exceeding that of any of the 20 peer companies.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS
As part of the Group’s annual incentive plan, the Remuneration 
Committee in 2021 approved share awards to Mr Galli in connection 
with the Group’s 2021 fiscal year performance (“2021 STI Share 
Grants”). These share awards were made in addition to cash payouts 
made under the company’s annual incentive plan. Specifically, 
the Remuneration Committee granted Mr Galli 1,000,000 shares 
in March 2021 following certification of the achievement of Group 
performance in the 2nd half of 2020. As this grant is made as part of 
the annual incentive plan, these shares vested upon grant.

Over the past three years the Remuneration Committee has shifted a 
significant portion of Mr Galli’s compensation to be share based and 
believes that rewarding him for exceptional annual results in the form 
of equity further aligns him with shareholders and creates further 
incentives for improved future performance.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In 2018 the Board approved multi-year performance-based share 
awards to Mr Galli (“2018 CEO Share Awards”) with the granting of 
the awards conditional upon the Company’s achievement of share 
price, financial, and operational performance criteria (“Performance 
Criteria”) over successive three-year performance periods ending 
each year from 2019 to 2023. Performance is assessed on both an 
absolute and relative basis. Mr Galli delivered exceptional share price, 
financial and operational performance over the three-year period 
ending in 2021 and he was therefore awarded one million shares, as 
per the terms of the incentive plan agreement (“2021 Award”). These 
shares are scheduled to vest to Mr Galli on January 1, 2025 if he 
remains in his current role.

Over the last three years, the Group delivered 23.1% compound 
annual revenue growth and 25.0% compound annual EBIT growth. 
The Group’s revenue growth over this period equaled the 97th 
percentile of performance of the Primary Peer Group while EBIT 
growth was the highest among all peers. Additionally, the Company’s 
profit margin exceeds two-thirds of the peers and profit margin 
improvement over the past three years exceeds 80% of the peer 
group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORTSince his appointment in February 2008 to the CEO role, TTI’s stock 
price has increased from HK$8.40 on February 1, 2008 to close at 
HK$155.20 at December 31, 2021, an increase of about 1,750%, 
greatly exceeding both the Hang Seng Index and the S&P500 Index 
over the same time period (see Chart 2). Since February 2008, the 
Group’s equity market capitalization has grown from approximately 
HK$12.6 billion to approximately HK$280 billion at the end of 
December 2021, adding over HK$75 billion in additional shareholder 
value in 2021 alone.

EQUITY PLAN DESCRIPTIONS

The Company has adopted two share award schemes, namely the 
2008 Share Award Scheme and the 2018 Share Award Scheme. The 
2008 Share Award Scheme was adopted on January 9, 2008 (the 
“2008 Adoption Date”) and expired from January 9, 2018, though its 
provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. 
Following the expiry of the 2008 Share Award Scheme, the 2018 
Share Award Scheme was adopted with effect from January 17, 2018 
(the “2018 Adoption Date”).

The scheme rules of both the 2008 Share Award Scheme and the 
2018 Share Award Scheme are substantially identical and below are 
the summary of the principal terms of both schemes:

Any employee or Director (including, without limitation, any Executive, 
Non-executive or Independent Non-executive Director) of any 
member of the Group (the “Eligible Person”) will be entitled to 
participate the schemes. Unless terminated earlier by the Board in 
accordance with the respective scheme rules, the effective term of 
each scheme is 10 years commencing on the adoption date of the 
relevant scheme provided that no contribution to the trust will be 
made by the Company on or after the 10th anniversary date of the 
adoption date of the relevant scheme. Details of both schemes were 
announced by the Company on the respective adoption date of the 
schemes.

The remainder of the 2018 CEO Share Awards (up to two million 
shares) will be awarded subject to the Company’s future performance 
meeting the goals set out in the 2018 CEO Share Awards plan from 
2022 to 2023. The 2021 Award was made under the 2018 Share 
Award Scheme, described below.

Besides the 2018 CEO Share Awards, the Board approved another 
multi-year performance-based share awards to Mr Galli (“2020 CEO 
Share Awards”) with the granting of the awards conditional upon the 
Company’s achievement of financial and operational performance 
criteria (“Financial and Performance Criteria”) for the year of 2021 
and the years between 2022 to 2026. Under the 2020 CEO Share 
Awards, 1,000,000 shares will be granted every year if the Financial 
and Performance Criteria have been achieved for that year.

MR GALLI’S PERFORMANCE HISTORY
The compensation package awarded to Mr Galli, including his annual 
cash incentive, the 2021 Award and the 2021 STI Share Grants, were 
awarded on the basis of the Group’s outstanding performance in 
2021 despite difficult global economic conditions, global supply chain 
disruptions and continuing uncertainty regarding the global health 
environment.

Mr Galli’s compensation is designed to reward him for the Company’s 
stellar growth and performance over the period of his tenure as CEO 
of the Group, to incentivize him to position the company for future 
profitable growth, to align him over the long-term with shareholder 
value creation, and to ensure his continued service to the Company in 
his current role.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORTThe Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select 
any Eligible Person for participation in any scheme as a selected 
grantee (the “Selected Grantee”) and determine the number of shares 
to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The relevant 
number of shares awarded will be purchased by the trustee of the 
schemes from the market or new shares will be subscribed for by the 
trustee at the cost of the Company and be held in trust until they are 
vested. When the Selected Grantee has satisfied all vesting conditions 
specified by the Board, the trustee will transfer the relevant vested 
shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of accrued 
interest) to the Selected Grantee.

The maximum number of shares which can be awarded under each 
scheme is 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the 
adoption date thereof, and the maximum number of shares which 
can be awarded under each scheme to a Selected Grantee, at any 
one time, shall not in aggregate exceed 1% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at the adoption date thereof. The total issued 
share capital of the Company as at the 2008 Adoption Date and the 
2018 Adoption Date were 1,501,252,152 shares and 1,835,021,941 
shares, respectively.

Since the 2008 Adoption Date and up to December 31, 2021, a total 
of 3,946,000 shares had been awarded under the 2008 Share Award 
Scheme, representing 0.26% of the issued share capital of  

the Company as at the 2008 Adoption Date. No recognition of  
share-based payment expenses under the 2008 Share Award Scheme 
during the year was incurred. During the year ended December 31, 
2021, no share was transferred to the Selected Grantees upon vesting 
under the 2008 Share Award Scheme and no total payout, including 
related expenses was incurred.

Since the 2018 Adoption Date and up to December 31, 2021, a total 
of 9,647,500 shares had been awarded under the 2018 Share Award 
Scheme, representing 0.53% of the issued share capital of  
the Company as at the 2018 Adoption Date. Recognition of 
share-based payment expenses under the 2018 Share Award 
Scheme during the year was US$19,638,000. During the year 
ended December 31, 2021, a total of 3,530,500 shares had been 
awarded under the 2018 Share Award Scheme to eleven Directors 
of the Company, representing 0.19% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at the 2018 Adoption Date. The total payout, 
including related expenses, amounted to US$44,112,000. In addition, 
during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2,391,500 shares were 
transferred to twelve Directors and certain Selected Grantees upon 
vesting under the 2018 Share Award Scheme. As at December 31, 
2021, details of the awarded shares granted to the Directors of the

the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems 
of the Company, which is designed to manage and minimize risks 
of failure in operational systems, and to provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance that material misstatement or loss can be avoided.

Committee and communicates with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee regularly so as to evaluate and manage significant risks 
that may be identified throughout. The internal audit function also

accuracy of risk assessments, risk reporting and adequacy of risk 
mitigation efforts.

the Group’s risk management culture, ensuring the whole risk 
management framework is adequate and effective and overseeing 
the internal audit function. The Group continuously reviews its risk 
framework in light of substantial changes and pursues improvements 
of enterprise risk management. A whistle blowing policy (the 
“Whistle Blowing Policy”) has been adopted in order to detect and 
identify improprieties and bring the issues to the attention of the 
management, the Audit Committee as well as the Board. Furthermore, 
the Group regularly conducts in-house anti-bribery training to bolster 
the Group’s anti-corruption culture.

The Board, and in particular the Audit Committee, conducts 
a continuous review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems that have been put in 
place. The reviews covering financial, operational, and compliance 
controls and risk management performed in 2021 included:

Share Options
Share Option Schemes
The Company has two share option schemes in place – Scheme D 
and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired 
on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and 
effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, Scheme 
E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the 
contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the 
eligible persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E 
are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal 
terms of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to 
the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group 
holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:
(i)  employees; or
(ii)  Directors; or
(iii)  secondees; or
(iv)  any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity 

or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued 
by any member of the Group; or

(vi)  suppliers; or
(vii)  customers; or

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORSShare options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date  
of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by  
the Board for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at 
any time, subject to vesting conditions from the date of grant to the 
tenth anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest 
of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share 
option; or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily 
quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading 
days immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options 
may be granted under the respective share option scheme is 
not permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the 
Company from time to time or 10.0% of the shares in issue as at the 

adoption date of the respective share option scheme. No person shall 
be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as at 
the date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first or second 
anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by 
the Directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of 
(i) the closing price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant; and 
(ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORSTO THE MEMBERS OF TECHTRONIC INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED
創科實業有限公司
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) set out on pages 97 to 186, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
December 31, 2021, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at  
December 31, 2021, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance  
with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”)  
and have been properly prepared in compliance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the “Code”), and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

93

Independent Auditor’s ReportKey Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter
Recognition of income taxes
We identified the recognition of income and deferred tax as a key 
audit matter as the Group operates in a complex multinational tax 
environment, in which the tax amounts, including provisions for 
potential tax exposures, and the realizability of the deferred tax 
assets, which depends on whether sufficient taxable profits or taxable 
temporary differences will be available in the future, are associated 
with a high degree of estimate and judgement.

As disclosed in Notes 10 and 41 to the consolidated financial 
statements, as at December 31, 2021, the Group has recognized 
US$83 million of income tax expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and US$97 million 
deferred tax assets in the consolidated statement of financial position, 
respectively.

How our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment about the 
recognition of income and deferred tax included:

•  Understanding and evaluating the management’s procedures 
and relevant controls regarding the completeness of tax 
exposures and estimating the provision for income tax and 
deferred tax assets to be recognized;

•  Understanding and evaluating management’s estimates and 
judgements and consider the status of current tax authority 
inquiries, judgmental positions taken in the tax returns, the 
outcome of previous inquiries and current estimates and 
developments in the tax environment;

•  Using our tax specialists to evaluate and challenge the 

adequacy of management’s key assumptions and read the latest 
correspondence with the tax authorities to assess management’s 
estimates; and

•  Evaluating management’s assessment of the sufficiency of future 
taxable profits supporting the recognition of deferred tax assets.

Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

94

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance 
with section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability 
to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 

circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 

the directors.

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 

consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 

express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

95

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in the independent auditor’s report is Mr. Stephen David Smart.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  For the year ended December 31, 20211.  General Information

Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in Hong Kong and its shares are 
listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). The address of the registered office and principal place of 
business of the Company is 29/F, Tower 2, Kowloon Commerce Centre, 51 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung, New Territories, Hong Kong.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are the manufacturing and trading of electrical and electronic 
products.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (“US$”), which is also the functional currency of the 
Company.

2.  Application of Amendments to Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”)

Amendments to HKFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied the following amendments to HKFRSs issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (“HKICPA”) for the first time, which are mandatorily effective for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:

Amendment to HKFRS 16

Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39,
  HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16

Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2

Except as described below, the application of the amendments to HKFRSs in the current year has had no material impact on the Group’s 
financial positions and performance for the current and prior years and/or on the disclosures set out in these consolidated financial 
statements.

Impacts on application of Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39, HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 
16 “Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2”
The Group has applied the amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments relate to changes in the basis for 
determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities as a result of interest rate benchmark 
reform, specific hedge accounting requirements and the related disclosure requirements applying HKFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures (“HKFRS 7”).

As at January 1, 2021, the Group has several financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments, the interest of which are indexed to 
benchmark rates that will be subject to interest rate benchmark reform.

The following table shows the total amounts of outstanding contracts with payments indexed to benchmark rates which are subject 
to interest rate benchmark reform. The amounts of financial liabilities are shown at their carrying amounts and derivative financial 
instruments are shown at their notional amounts.

Derivative financial instruments

Cross-currency interest rate swaps

The amendments have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements as none of the relevant contracts has been transitioned to 
the relevant replacement rates during the year. The Group will apply the practical expedient in relation to the changes in contractual cash 
flows resulting from the interest rate benchmark reform for unsecured borrowings measured at amortized cost. Additional disclosures as 
required by HKFRS 7 are set out in Note 36.

Effective for annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined.

Except for the amendments to HKFRSs mentioned below, the directors of the Company anticipate that the application of all other new and 
amendments to HKFRSs will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future.

Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and related 
amendments to Hong Kong Interpretation 5 (2020)
The amendments provide clarification and additional guidance on the assessment of right to defer settlement for at least twelve months 
from reporting date for classification of liabilities as current or non-current, which:

• 

specify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the 
reporting period. Specifically, the amendments clarify that:
(i) 
(ii) 

the classification should not be affected by management intentions or expectations to settle the liability within 12 months; and
if the right is conditional on the compliance with covenants, the right exists if the conditions are met at the end of the reporting 
period, even if the lender does not test compliance until a later date; and

•  clarify that if a liability has terms that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the transfer of the entity’s 

own equity instruments, these terms do not affect its classification as current or non-current only if the entity recognizes the option 
separately as an equity instrument applying HKAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.

In addition, Hong Kong Interpretation 5 was revised as a consequence of the Amendments to HKAS 1 to align the corresponding wordings 
with no change in conclusion.

Based on the Group’s outstanding liabilities as at December 31, 2021, the application of the amendments will not result in a 
reclassification of the Group’s liabilities.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 2021 
 
2.  Application of Amendments to Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)
Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies
HKAS 1 is amended to replace all instances of the term “significant accounting policies” with “material accounting policy information”. 
Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, 
it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of 
those financial statements.

The amendments also clarify that accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other 
events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, 
other events or conditions is itself material. If an entity chooses to disclose immaterial accounting policy information, such information 
must not obscure material accounting policy information.

HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements (the “Practice Statement”) is also amended to illustrate how an entity applies 
the “four-step materiality process” to accounting policy disclosures and to judge whether information about an accounting policy is 
material to its financial statements. Guidance and examples are added to the Practice Statement.

The application of the amendments is not expected to have significant impact on the financial position or performance of the Group 
but may affect the disclosures of the Group’s significant accounting policies. The impacts of application, if any, will be disclosed in the 
Group’s future consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to HKAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates
The amendments define accounting estimates as “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement 
uncertainty”. An accounting policy may require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement 
uncertainty – that is, the accounting policy may require such items to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed 
directly and must instead be estimated. In such a case, an entity develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by the 
accounting policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable 
information.

In addition, the concept of changes in accounting estimates in HKAS 8 is retained with additional clarifications.

The application of the amendments is not expected to have significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to HKAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single 
Transaction
The amendments narrow the scope of the recognition exemption of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets in paragraphs 15 
and 24 of HKAS 12 Income Taxes so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences.

As disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, for leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the 
lease liabilities, the Group applies HKAS 12 requirements to the relevant assets and liabilities as a whole. Temporary differences relating to 
relevant assets and liabilities are assessed on a net basis.

Upon the application of the amendments, the Group will recognize a deferred tax asset (to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and 
taxable temporary differences associated with the right of use assets and the lease liabilities.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early application permitted. As at 
December 31, 2021, the carrying amounts of right of use assets and lease liabilities which are subject to the amendments amounted to 
US$524,917,000 and US$554,200,000 respectively. The Group is still in the process of assessing the full impact of the application of the 
amendments. The cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments will be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of 
retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021 105

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 20213.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. For the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, information is considered material if such information is reasonably expected to 
influence decisions made by primary users. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by 
the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange (the “Listing Rules”) and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance 
(“CO”).

The directors of the Company have, at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are 
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair 
value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for 
share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are accounted 
for in accordance with HKFRS 16 Leases and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net 
realizable value in HKAS 2 Inventories or value in use in HKAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:

•  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 

measurement date;

•  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 

or indirectly; and

•  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Significant Accounting Policies

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

•  has the power over the investee;
• 
•  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each item of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

(continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION (continued)
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity therein, which represent present ownership 
interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets of the relevant subsidiaries upon liquidation.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OR ASSET ACQUISITIONS

Optional Concentration Test
The Group can elect to apply an optional concentration test, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, that permits a simplified assessment 
of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value 
of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The gross assets under 
assessment exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities. If the 
concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is needed.

Asset Acquisitions
When the Group acquires a group of assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business, the Group identifies and recognizes the 
individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by allocating the purchase price first to financial assets/financial liabilities at 
the respective fair values, the remaining balance of the purchase price is then allocated to the other identifiable assets and liabilities on 
the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase. Such a transaction does not give rise to goodwill or bargain purchase gain.

Business Combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities 
incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Except for certain recognition exemptions, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of an asset 
and a liability in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (replaced by the Conceptual Framework for 
Financial Reporting issued in October 2010).

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value, except that:

•  deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in 

• 

accordance with HKAS 12 Income Taxes and HKAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements 
of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with HKFRS 2 
at the acquisition date (see the accounting policy below);

•  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 

• 

Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard; and
lease liabilities are recognized and measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments (as defined in HKFRS 16) as if the 
acquired leases were new leases at the acquisition date, except for leases for which (a) the lease term ends within 12 months of the 
acquisition date; or (b) the underlying asset is of low value. Right of use assets (“ROU assets”) are recognized and measured at the 
same amount as the relevant lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with 
market terms.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after re-assessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the relevant subsidiary’s 
net assets in the event of liquidation are initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets or at fair value. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-
by-transaction basis.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a 
business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are 
adjusted retrospectively. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 
“measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how 
the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is 
remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business (see the 
accounting policy above) less any accumulated impairment losses, if any.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) (or group of CGUs) 
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes and not larger than an operating segment.

A CGU (or group of CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is 
indication that the unit may be impaired. For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a reporting period, the CGU (or groups of CGUs) to 
which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment before the end of that reporting period.

If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (or group of 
CGUs). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant CGU or any of the CGU within the group of CGUs, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the amount of profit or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of an operation within the CGU (or a CGU within a 
group of CGUs), the amount of goodwill disposed of is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation (or the CGU) disposed 
of and the portion of the CGU (or the group of CGUs) retained.

The Group’s policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is disclosed below.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

INTEREST IN AN ASSOCIATE
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The result and assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. The financial statements of an associate used for equity accounting purposes are prepared using uniform accounting policies 
as those of the Group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. Under the equity method, investment in an associate is 
initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of 
the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of an associate. Changes in net assets of an associate other than profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income are not accounted for unless such changes resulted in changes in ownership interest held by the Group. 
When the Group’s share of loss of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. 
Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of that associate.

An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee becomes an associate. On 
acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after 
reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that the interest in an associate may be impaired. When any objective evidence 
exists, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with HKAS 36 as a single 
asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any 
impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any 
reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in accordance with HKAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment 
subsequently increases.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in the 
investee with a resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate and the 
retained interest is a financial asset within the scope of HKFRS 9, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and 
the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the 
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of the relevant interest in the 
associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or 
loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) upon disposal/partial disposal of the relevant associate.

When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies 
to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group (such as a sale or contribution of assets), profits and losses resulting from 
the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associate that are not related to the Group.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible Assets Acquired Separately
Intangible assets acquired separately and with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried 
at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value 
at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination with finite useful lives are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated 
impairment losses.

Internally-Generated Intangible Assets – Research and Development Expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development activities (or from the development phase of an internal project) is 
recognized only if all of the following have been demonstrated:

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

• 
• 
• 
•  how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• 

the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

• 

The amount initially recognized for an internally-generated intangible asset is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when 
the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognized, 
development expenditure is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, an internally-generated intangible asset is reported at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses (if any), on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognized.

LEASES

Definition of a Lease
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.

For contracts entered into or modified on or after the date of initial application of HKFRS 16 or arising from business combinations, the 
Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under HKFRS 16 at inception, modification date or 
acquisition date, as appropriate. Such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently 
changed.

As a practical expedient, leases with similar characteristics are accounted on a portfolio basis when the Group reasonably expects that the 
effects on the consolidated financial statements would not differ materially from individual leases within the portfolio.

The Group as a Lessee

Allocation of Consideration to Components of a Contract

For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the 
aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

Non-lease components are separated from lease component and are accounted for by applying other applicable standards.

Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the recognition exemption for lease of low-value assets. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic 
basis over the lease term.

ROU Assets

The cost of ROU assets includes:

the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

• 
•  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;
•  any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and
•  an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is 

located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

ROU assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities.

ROU assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term are 
depreciated from commencement date to the end of the useful life. Otherwise, ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

The Group presents ROU assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Refundable Rental Deposits

Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at initial 
recognition are considered as additional lease payments and included in the cost of ROU assets.

LEASES (continued)

The Group as a Lessee (continued)

Lease Liabilities

At the commencement date of a lease, the Group recognizes and measures the lease liability at the present value of lease payments that 
are unpaid at that date. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

The lease payments include:

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

• 
• 
•  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;
• 
•  payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and

After the commencement date, lease liabilities are adjusted by interest accretion and lease payments.

The Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Lease Modifications

The Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if:

• 
• 

the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and
the consideration for the leases increases by an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the increase in scope and any 
appropriate adjustments to that standalone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.

For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group remeasures the lease liability based on the lease term of 
the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

The Group accounts for the remeasurement of lease liabilities by making corresponding adjustments to the relevant ROU asset. When 
the modified contract contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the 
consideration in the modified contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and 
the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT (“PP&E”)
PP&E are tangible assets that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, other than 
freehold land and construction in progress as described below. PP&E are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost 
less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Freehold land is not depreciated and are measured at cost less subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognized so as to write-off the cost of items of PP&E, other than freehold land and construction in progress, over their 
estimated useful lives and after taking into account of their estimated residual values, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful 
lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.

(continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT (“PP&E”) (continued)
PP&E in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purpose is carried at cost, less any recognized impairment 
loss. Cost includes any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy. Construction in progress is classified to the appropriate category of PP&E when completed and ready for its intended 
use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other PP&E, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

When the Group makes payments for ownership interests of properties which includes both leasehold land and building elements, the 
entire consideration is allocated between the leasehold land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values at initial 
recognition. To the extent the allocation of the relevant payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold is presented as “ROU assets” 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. When the consideration cannot be allocated reliably between non-lease building 
element and undivided interest in the underlying leasehold land, the entire properties are classified as PP&E.

An item of PP&E is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the item) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognized.

IMPAIRMENT ON PP&E, ROU ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL
At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets with finite useful 
lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. 
The recoverable amount of PP&E, ROU assets and intangible assets are estimated individually. When it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount individually, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.

In testing a CGU for impairment, corporate assets are allocated to the relevant CGU when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation 
can be established, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be established. The recoverable amount is determined for the CGU or group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and is 
compared with the carrying amount of the relevant CGU or group of CGUs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset (or a CGU) for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or a 
CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. For corporate assets or portion of corporate assets which cannot be allocated on a reasonable 
and consistent basis to a CGU, the Group compares the carrying amount of a group of CGUs, including the carrying amounts of the 
corporate assets or portion of corporate assets allocated to that group of CGUs, with the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs. In 
allocating the impairment loss, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if applicable) and then 
to the other assets on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit or the group of CGUs. The carrying amount 
of an asset is not reduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable), its value in use (if determinable) and 
zero. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro-rata to the other assets of 
the unit or the group of CGUs. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU or a group of CGUs) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU or a group of CGUs) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when a group entity becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and 
derecognized on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables arising from contracts with 
customers which are initially measured in accordance with HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“HKFRS 15”). 
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial 
assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial 
assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest 
income and interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Financial Assets

Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized cost:

• 
• 

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and
the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”):

• 
• 

the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both selling and collecting contractual cash flows; and
the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship and at 
initial recognition of a financial asset the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment 
in other comprehensive income if that equity investment is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer 
in a business combination to which HKFRS 3 Business Combinations (“HKFRS 3”) applies.

A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or

• 
•  on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent 

actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

• 

Amortized Cost and Interest Income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for financial assets measured subsequently at amortized cost. Interest 
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets 
that have subsequently become credit-impaired (see below). For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest 
income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period. If 
the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income 
is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the beginning of the reporting 
period following the determination that the asset is no longer credit-impaired.

Financial Assets at FVTPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI or designated as FVTOCI are measured at 
FVTPL except for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge relationship.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in 
profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial assets.

Impairment of Financial Assets and Other Item Subject to Impairment Assessment under HKFRS 9
The Group performs impairment assessment under expected credit loss (“ECL”) model on financial assets (including trade and 
other receivables, bills receivable, trade receivables from an associate, bank balances and deposits) which are subject to impairment 
assessment under HKFRS 9. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of the relevant instrument. In 
contrast, 12-month ECL (“12m ECL”) represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date. Assessments are done based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 
factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current conditions at the reporting 
date as well as the forecast of future conditions.

The Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables.

For all other instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to 12m ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, in which case the Group recognizes lifetime ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be 
recognized is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.

(i) 

Significant Increase in Credit Risk
In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at 
the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is 
reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or 
effort.

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly:

•  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;
• 

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit 
default swap prices for the debtor;

•  existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant 

decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

•  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;
•  an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that 

results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable 
information that demonstrates otherwise.

Impairment of Financial Assets and Other Item Subject to Impairment Assessment under HKFRS 9 (continued)

(i) 

Significant Increase in Credit Risk (continued)
Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition if the debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined 
to have low credit risk if (i) it has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not 
necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a debt instrument 
to have low credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment grade” as per globally understood definitions.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the 
amount becomes past due.

(ii)  Definition of Default

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default occurs when information developed internally or 
obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking 
into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due 
unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more 
appropriate.

(iii)  Credit-impaired Financial Assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events of default that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the 
following events:

(a)  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;

(b)  a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

(c) 

the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted 
to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; or

(d)  it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.

(iv)  Write-off Policy

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and 
there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example, when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered 
into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery 
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Any subsequent 
recoveries are recognized in profit or loss.

(v)  Measurement and Recognition of ECL

The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a 
default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data 
and forward-looking information. Estimation of ECL reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined with 
the respective risks of default occurring as the weights.

Generally, the ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract 
and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL for trade receivables are considered on a collective basis taking into consideration past due information and relevant 
credit information such as forward-looking macroeconomic information.

For collective assessment, the Group takes into consideration the following characteristics when formulating the grouping:

•  Past-due status;
•  Nature, size and industry of debtors; and
•  External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit risk 
characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset unless the financial asset is credit-impaired, 
in which case interest income is calculated based on amortized cost of the financial asset (i.e. gross carrying amount less loss 
allowance for ECL).

The Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments by adjusting their carrying amount, 
with the exception of trade receivables where the corresponding adjustment is recognized through a loss allowance account.

Financial Liabilities and Equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity Instrument

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Buy-back of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost

Financial liabilities (including unsecured borrowings, trade and other payables, bills payable and discounted bills with recourse) are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Financial Liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business 
combination to which HKFRS 3 applies, (ii) held for trading or (iii) it is designated as at FVTPL.

A financial liability is held for trading if:

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or

• 
•  on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 

pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a designated and effective hedging instrument.

• 

A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading or contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination may 
be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:

• 
• 

• 

such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and HKFRS 9 permits the entire combined contract to be 
designated as at FVTPL.

For financial liabilities that are designated as at FVTPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to 
changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in 
the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair 
value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognized in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified 
to profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained profits upon derecognition of the financial liability.

Changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of interest rate benchmark reform

For changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability to which the amortized cost 
measurement applies as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group applies the practical expedient to account for these 
changes by updating the effective interest rate, such change in effective interest rate normally has no significant effect on the carrying 
amount of the relevant financial asset or financial liability.

A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if and only if, both these 
conditions are met:

• 
• 

the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and
the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (i.e. the basis immediately 
preceding the change).

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date when a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments for cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of 
the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

For the purpose of determining whether a forecast transaction (or a component thereof) is highly probable, the Group assumes that the 
interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, is not altered as a result 
of interest rate benchmark reform.

Assessment of Hedging Relationship and Effectiveness

For hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group considers whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in cash flows 
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness 
requirements:

• 
• 
• 

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;
the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and
the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually 
hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective 
for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances 
the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

For changes made to the hedged risk, hedged item or hedging instrument required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group amends 
the formal designation of a hedging relationship to reflect the changes by the end of the reporting period during which the relevant 
changes were made. Such an amendment to the formal designation of the hedging relationship constitutes neither the discontinuation of 
the hedging relationship nor the designation of a new hedging relationship.

In assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the Group assumes that the interest rate 
benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the 
interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark 
reform.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from 
inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

When a hedged item in a cash flow hedge is amended to reflect the changes that are required by the interest rate benchmark reform, 
the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged 
future cash flows are determined.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (hedging reserve) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as the recognized hedged item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the 
cash flow hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

Discontinuation of Hedge Accounting

The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a part thereof) ceases to meet the 
qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised. Discontinuing hedge accounting can either affect a hedging relationship in its entirety or only a part of it (in which case hedge 
accounting continues for the remainder of the hedging relationship).

For cash flow hedge, any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognized when the forecast transactions is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Derecognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognizes its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a 
collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the 
consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss.

The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The 
difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in 
profit or loss.

PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are 
measured at the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into 
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the 
present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

Provisions for the expected cost of assurance-type warranty obligations under the relevant contracts with customers for sales of goods 
are recognized at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s 
obligation.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of inventories are determined on a using the first-in, first-out 
method. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs 
necessary to make the sales. Costs necessary to make the sale include incremental costs directly attributable to the sale and non-
incremental costs which the Group must incur to make the sale.

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when “control” of the goods or services underlying 
the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or 
services that are substantially the same.

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognized over time by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the 
relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met:

• 
• 
• 

the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs;
the Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or
the Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the distinct good or service.

OVER TIME REVENUE RECOGNITION (COMMISSION AND ROYALTY INCOME): MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS 
COMPLETE SATISFACTION OF A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION
The progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured based on output method, which is to recognize 
revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer to date relative to the 
remaining goods or services promised under the contract, that best depict the Group’s performance in transferring control of goods or 
services.

As a practical expedient, if the Group has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Group’s 
performance completed to date (i.e. royalty income), the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Group has the right to 
invoice.

REFUND LIABILITIES
The Group recognizes a refund liability if the Group expects to refund some or all of the consideration received from customers.

SALE WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN/EXCHANGE
For a sale of products with a right of return/exchange for dissimilar products, the Group recognizes all of the following:

(a)  revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled (therefore, revenue 

would not be recognized for the products expected to be returned/exchanged);

(b)  a refund liability; and

(c)  an asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for its right to recover products from customers and are presented as right 

to returned goods asset.

TAXATION
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

TAXATION (continued)
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and an associate, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and 
interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits 
of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or 
the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognizes the ROU assets and the related lease 
liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax deductions are attributable to the ROU assets or the lease liabilities.

For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group applies HKAS 12 Income Taxes 
requirements to the leasing transaction as a whole. Temporary differences relating to ROU assets and lease liabilities are assessed on 
a net basis. Excess of depreciation on ROU assets over the lease payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities resulting in net 
deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied to the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in 
the accounting for the business combination.

In assessing any uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Group considers whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will 
accept the uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by individual group entities in their income tax filings. If it is probable, 
the current and deferred taxes are determined consistently with the tax treatment in the income tax filings. If it is not probable that the 
relevant taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of each uncertainty is reflected by using either the most likely 
amount or the expected value.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that 
entity (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting 
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates at that date. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognized in profit or 
loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on a monetary items receivable from or payable to foreign 
operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in a foreign operation), in 
which case, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity and will be reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period, and 
their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of translation reserve (attributed to non-controlling interests 
as appropriate).

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that 
includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners 
of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the 
proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognized in profit 
or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of an associate that do not result in the Group losing significant influence), the 
proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after January 
1, 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the 
reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on acquisitions of foreign operations before January 1, 2005 
are treated as non-monetary foreign currency items of the acquirer and reported using the historical exchange rate prevailing at the date 
of the acquisition.

BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date.

The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments determined at the grant date without taking into consideration all non-market 
vesting conditions is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve). At the end of each 
reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest based on assessment of all relevant 
non-market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

At the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognized in employee share-based compensation reserve 
would be transferred to share capital. When the share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the amount 
previously recognized in the employee share-based compensation reserve would be transferred to retained profits.

When the trustee purchases the Company’s shares from the open market, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is presented as shares held for share award scheme and deducted from total equity. No gain or loss is recognized on 
the transactions of the Company’s own shares.

When the trustee transfers the Company’s shares to grantees upon vesting, the related costs of the granted shares vested are reversed 
from shares held under the share award scheme. Accordingly, the related expense of the granted shares vested is reversed from the 
employee share-based compensation reserve. The difference arising from this transfer is debited/credited to retained profits. At the end of 
the reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that are expected to ultimately vest. The impact of the revision 
of the estimate, if any, is recognized in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to 
them and that the grants will be received. Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in 
which the Group recognized as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Government grants related to income that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of 
giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they 
become receivable. Government grants relating to compensation of expenses are deducted from the related expenses, other government 
grants are presented under “other income”.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme are charged as expenses when 
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

For defined benefit retirement benefits plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in 
the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in reserves and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES (continued)
Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment or curtailment and a gain or loss on settlement is 
recognized when settlement occurs. When determining past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, an entity shall remeasure the 
net defined benefit liability or asset using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions, reflecting the benefits 
offered under the plan and the plan assets before and after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, without considering the 
effect of asset ceiling (i.e. the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan).

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. However, 
if the Group remeasures the net defined benefit liability or asset before plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, the Group determines 
net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using the benefits 
offered under the plan and the plan assets after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and the discount rate used to remeasure 
such net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period 
resulting from contributions or benefit payments.

Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows:

service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

• 
•  net interest expense or income; and
• 

remeasurement.

The retirement benefit obligations recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

SHORT-TERM AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid as and when employees 
rendered the services. All short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense unless another HKFRS requires or permits the 
inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset.

A liability is recognized for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave) after deducting any 
amount already paid.

Liabilities recognized in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Any changes in the 
liabilities’ carrying amounts resulting from service costs, interests and remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent 
that another HKFRS requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 20214.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors are required to make estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the estimates are revised if the revisions affect only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the 
revisions affect both current and future periods.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year.

Capitalization, Useful Lives and Estimated Impairment of Deferred Development Costs
Determining the development costs, including the time and costs for individual projects, to be capitalized requires estimations and 
assumptions based on the expected future economic benefits to be generated by the products resulting from these development costs. 
Other important estimations and assumptions in this assessment process are the feasibility of mass production, the distinction between 
research and development and the estimated useful life. As at December 31, 2021, the carrying amounts of deferred development costs 
of the Group are US$572,449,000 (2020: US$394,144,000). The estimation of their useful lives impacts the level of annual amortization 
recorded. The estimation of their useful lives reflects the directors’ best estimate of the periods that future economic benefits will be 
received through the use of the assets. In determining whether the deferred development costs are impaired, the management takes into 
consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the underlying projects, and the progress of these projects. 
When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise and need to be recognized. 
Management is confident that the carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and 
adjustments will be made in future periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Income Taxes
The Group operates in a complex multinational tax environment. The Group carefully evaluates tax implications of its transactions in 
accordance with prevailing tax regulations and makes tax provision accordingly. However, judgement is required in determining the 
Group’s provision for taxation charge as there are many transactions and calculations, of which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
during the ordinary course of business. When the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recorded, such differences will impact on the income tax and deferred tax provision in the periods in which such determination is made. 
The carrying amount of current tax payable carried as liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 
2021 was US$56,123,000 (2020: US$32,336,000).

As at December 31, 2021, deferred tax assets of US$17,797,000 (2020: US$25,362,000) in relation to unused tax losses and 
US$74,748,000 (2020: US$39,452,000) in relation to employee related provisions has been recognized in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position. The realizability of the deferred tax assets mainly depends on whether sufficient taxable profits, or taxable 
temporary differences, will be available in the future. In cases where the actual future taxable profits generated are less than expected, or 
change in facts and circumstances which result in revision of future taxable profits estimation, a material reversal or further recognition 
of the deferred tax assets may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which the reversal or further recognition 
takes place. During the year, deferred tax assets of approximately US$8,100,000 (2020: US$6,703,000) in relation to unused tax losses 
were utilized.

Information about Major Customer
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Group’s largest customer contributed total revenue of US$6,275,193,000 
(2020: US$4,793,600,000), of which US$6,206,588,000 (2020: US$4,742,534,000) was under the Power Equipment segment and 
US$68,605,000 (2020: US$51,066,000) was under the Floorcare & Cleaning segment. There is no other customer contributing more 
than 10% of total revenue.

6.  Revenue

Revenue represents the fair value of the net amounts received and receivable for goods sold by the Group to outside customers, less 
returns and allowances, and commission and royalty income received during the year and is analyzed as follows:

Sales of goods

Commission and royalty income

2020
US$’000

10,701

13,203,161

9,811,941

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized at a point in time. Commission and royalty income is recognized over time.

The Group sells products mainly to the wholesale market. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred, being when 
the goods have been shipped to the wholesaler’s specific location or pick up point (delivery).

Following delivery, the wholesaler has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary 
responsibility when on selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.

Revenue is recognized for sales which are considered highly probable and where a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue 
recognized will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for sales in which revenue has not yet been recognized. The Group’s right 
to recover the product when customers exercise their right to return products is recognized as a right to returned goods asset and a 
corresponding adjustment to cost of sales.

As at December 31, 2021, revenue for unsatisfied contracts to be recognized by the Group over one year is immaterial. As permitted by 
HKFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied contracts for contracts with period of one year or less is not disclosed.

For both years, the Group leases land and buildings, office equipment, furniture and fixtures, plant and machinery, motor vehicles and 
aircraft for its operations. Lease contracts are entered into for term of up to 50 years (2020: 18 years). Lease terms are negotiated on an 
individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the 
non-cancellable period, the Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

In addition, the Group owns office buildings. The Group is the registered owner of these property interests, including the underlying 
leasehold lands. Lump sum payments were made upfront to acquire these property interests. The leasehold land components of these 
owned properties are presented separately only if the payments made can be allocated reliably.

The Group regularly entered into short-term leases for premises, plant and machinery and motor vehicles. As at December 31, 2021 and 
2020, the portfolio of short-term leases is similar to the portfolio of short-term leases to which the short-term lease expense disclosed 
above.

Leases Committed
As at December 31, 2021, the Group entered into new leases for certain PP&E that have not yet commenced, with average non-
cancellable period that ranges from 1 to 6 years (2020: 1 to 6 years) with extension options, the total future undiscounted cash flows 
under which amounts to US$59,395,000 (2020: US$7,294,000) over the non-cancellable period.

Details of the lease maturity analysis of the lease liabilities are set out in Note 33.

The retailer and service relationships were acquired through business combinations which related to the relationships with retailers and 
service centers.

Deferred development costs are internally-generated by capitalizing the costs pertaining to the development of new or enhancement of 
existing products.

Included in trademarks of the Group, US$224,440,000 (2020: US$224,440,000) are trademarks considered by the management of 
the Group as having indefinite useful lives because they are expected to contribute to the Group’s net cash inflows indefinitely. The 
trademarks will not be amortized until their useful lives are determined to be finite. Instead they will be tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Particulars of the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 20.

As explained in Note 5, the Group uses the types of goods sold for preparing the operating segment information. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives set out in Notes 18 and 19, the majority of the amounts have been 
allocated to four major individual CGUs, including three units in the Power Equipment segment and one unit in the Floorcare & Cleaning 
segment. The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks as at December 31, 2021 allocated to these units are as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2020, management of the Group wrote off goodwill of US$3,861,000 and trademarks of 
US$3,200,000 pertaining to amounts included in the Others CGU and Power Equipment – TTI OPE CGU respectively.

The basis of the recoverable amounts of the above CGUs and their major underlying assumptions are summarized below:

Power Equipment – MET (“MET”)
The recoverable amounts of MET’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period and a discount rate 
of 7.5% (2020: 8.5%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for MET are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on MET’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched, managing the working 
capital and the continuance of costs controlling strategy implemented by the Group. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are 
extrapolated using a steady 3.0% (2020: 3.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of MET’s goodwill and intangible assets to exceed the estimated recoverable amounts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 2021 
 
20.  Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives (continued)

Power Equipment – TTI OPE (“TTI OPE”)
The recoverable amounts of TTI OPE’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate 
of 9.0% (2020: 10.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for TTI OPE are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on TTI OPE’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the continuance of 
costs controlling strategy implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth 
rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of TTI 
OPE’s goodwill and intangible assets to exceed the estimated recoverable amounts.

Power Equipment – Drebo (“Drebo”)
The recoverable amounts of Drebo’s goodwill have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 9.0% (2020: 9.0%) per 
annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Drebo are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including 
sales, gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Drebo’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success of the new products launched and the continuance 
of costs controlling strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a 3.0% (2020: 3.0%) 
growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying 
amounts of Drebo’s goodwill to exceed the estimated recoverable amount.

Floorcare & Cleaning – RAM/Hoover/VAX (“RAM/Hoover/VAX”)
The recoverable amounts of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangible assets have been determined based on a value in use calculation. 
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount 
rate of 12.0% (2020: 12.5%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for RAM/Hoover/VAX are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows 
including sales, gross margin, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The assumptions and 
estimations are based on RAM/Hoover/VAX’s past performance, management’s expectations of the market development, managing the 
working capital and the continuance of costs controlling strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are 
extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2020: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the estimated aggregate 
recoverable amounts.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and 
defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly. Trade receivables that are neither past 
due nor impaired have the best credit scoring attributable under the internal credit scoring system used by the Group.

As at December 31, 2021, included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with aggregate carrying amount of 
US$220,824,000 (2020: US$307,439,000) which are past due as at the reporting date. The past due over 90 days balances that are 
presumed in default according with the Group’s accounting policy of US$145,059,000 (2020: US$254,508,000) are not considered as in 
default as they are due from a number of independent customers that have a good payment track record with the Group.

The Group had a policy of allowing credit periods ranging mainly from 30 days to 120 days.

In accordance with receivables purchase agreements, certain trade receivables have been factored to banks (the “Factored Trade 
Receivables”). As the Group still retained the risks associated in respect of default payments, the Group has continued to recognize 
the Factored Trade Receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position. At the end of the reporting period, proceeds from 
the Factored Trade Receivables of US$75,000,000 (2020: US$10,000,000) were recognized as liabilities and included in “Unsecured 
borrowings – due within one year” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

26.  Bills Receivable

All the Group’s bills receivable at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are aged within 120 days based on invoice date.

27.  Trade Receivables from an Associate

The trade receivables from an associate are aged within 120 days based on invoice date.

Cross-currency Interest Rate Swaps
The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as effective hedging instrument to minimize its exposures to interest rate 
risk on US$ floating borrowings and foreign currency risk on the intercompany advances which affects the consolidated profit or loss.

The cross-currency interest rate swaps with notional amount of US$210,300,000 (2020: US$210,300,000) have fixed currency payments 
in EUR at exchange rate of EUR to US$ at 1.102 and 1.077 (2020: at 1.102 and 1.077), fixed interest payments monthly in EUR at 
0.305% and 0.520% per annum (2020: 0.305% and 0.520% per annum) for periods up until October 2023, October 2024, April 2024 
and April 2025 (2020: October 2023, October 2024, April 2024 and April 2025).

The floating rate index and the currency exposure of the cross-currency interest rate swaps match with the floating rate US$ bank 
borrowings and the currency exposure of the intercompany advances respectively.

During the year, a fair value gain of US$21,880,000 (December 31, 2020: fair value loss of US$28,277,000) has been recognized in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in hedging reserve and is expected to be reclassified to profit or loss.

The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined by using the discounted cash flow method based on LIBOR yield 
curves and the forward exchange rates between US$ and EUR estimated at the end of the reporting period.

35.  Capital Risk Management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return 
to shareholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balances. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from prior 
years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt which includes unsecured borrowings and discounted bills with recourse, net of 
cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to Owners of the Company, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained 
profits.

Gearing Ratio
The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the management considers the cost 
of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a target gearing ratio of not exceeding 35% determined as the 
proportion of net debt to equity. The Group will continue to execute very disciplined control and management of its working capital and 
generate free cash inflows through the growth of the business.

The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:

36.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group’s corporate treasury function provides risk management advice to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic 
and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyze exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These financial risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group seeks to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments or natural hedges to mitigate these 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies is reviewed internally on a continuous basis. 
The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

36.2.1  FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

Subsidiaries of the Group have foreign currency sales and purchases, which exposes the Group to foreign currency risk. 
Approximately 21.0% (2020: 20.4%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the group entity making the sale, whilst almost 13.0% (2020: 14.4%) of purchases are denominated in the group entity’s 
respective functional currency.

The carrying amounts of certain significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

1,715,483

Note:  For group entities with their functional currency as the US$, monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars have no 

material foreign currency risk exposure as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged with the US$.

The Group requires its group entities to use foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the currency exposure. The 
foreign exchange forward contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. On this basis, the Group has entered 
into forward contracts in relation to the foreign currency amounting to US$693,733,000 (2020: US$946,737,000). It is the 
Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximize hedge 
effectiveness (see Note 28 for details).

The Group also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce currency exposure to hedge against the debts which are 
effective to convert the foreign currency debts to the functional currency of the relevant group entity. The critical terms of 
these currency swaps are similar to those of hedged borrowings.

36.2.1  FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

Sensitivity Analysis
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% (2020: 5%) increase and decrease in the functional currency 
against foreign currency without considering the cross-currency interest rate swaps entered at end of the reporting period. 
5% (2020: 5%) is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in the foreign exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis 
includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and excludes the effect of cross-currency interest 
rate swaps held at the reporting date. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit for the year where functional 
currency weakens 5% (2020: 5%) against foreign currency. For a 5% (2020: 5%) strengthening of functional currency 
against the foreign currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit for the year and the amounts below 
would be negative.

This is mainly attributable to the net exposure on receivables, payables and unsecured borrowings denominated in US$ & EUR as foreign 
currency at the reporting date.

36.2.2  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section of 
this note. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate borrowings (see Note 37 for details 
of these borrowings), discounted bills with recourse and bank balances and deposits. The Group’s cash flow interest rate 
risk is mainly concentrated on LIBOR arising from the Group’s US$ and EUR denominated borrowings. In relation to interest 
bearing bank balances and deposits, the Group considers the interest rate risk to be low. The management continuously 
monitors interest rate fluctuations and will consider further hedging the interest rate risk should the need arise.

The Group is also exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to fixed-rate unsecured borrowings (see Note 37 for details 
of these borrowings) and lease liabilities.

During the year, the Group obtained new unsecured borrowings of US$7,300 million (2020: US$3,694 million) which are 
either at a fixed rate or LIBOR based. The proceeds were used for refinancing the Group’s borrowings.

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of 
some interbank offered rates (“IBORs”) with alternative nearly risk-free rates. Details of the impacts on the Group’s risk 
management strategy arising from the interest rate benchmark reform and the progress towards implementation of alternative 
benchmark interest rates are set out under “interest rate benchmark reform” in this note.

36.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

36.2.2  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at 
the end of the reporting period. The analysis is prepared assuming the financial instruments outstanding at the end of the 
reporting period was outstanding for the whole year without considering the cross-currency interest rate swaps entered at the 
end of the reporting period. A 50 basis points (2020: 50 basis points) increase or decrease in LIBOR is used when reporting 
interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points (2020: 50 basis points) higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s post-tax profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 would decrease/increase by US$11,828,000 (2020: 
decrease/increase by US$3,992,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate 
borrowings.

The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the decrease in variable-rate 
debt instruments.

36.2.3  OTHER PRICE RISK

The Group is exposed to price risk mainly through its listed equity securities.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of listed equity securities 
measured at fair value at the reporting date.

If the prices of the listed equity securities had been 10% higher, the profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 of the 
Group would have increase by US$1,627,000 (2020: increase by US$1,776,000) as a result of the changes in the fair values 
of the listed equity securities.

36.2.4  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT

As at December 31, 2021, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group 
amounted to US$3,910,922,000 (2020: US$2,913,062,000). The Group’s credit risk exposures are primarily attributable to 
trade and other receivables, bills receivables, trade receivables from an associate and bank balances, deposits and cash. The 
Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit risk associated with its financial assets.

Trade receivables arising from contracts with customers
In order to minimize the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of 
credit limits and credit approvals. Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system 
to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to 
customers are reviewed twice a year. Other monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken to 
recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group performs impairment assessment using an ECL model on trade receivables 
collectively which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics by reference to the Group’s internal credit ratings. 
In this regard, the directors of the Company consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced.

The Group has concentration of credit risk as 43.0% (2020: 35.0%) and 61.9% (2020: 53.6%) of the total trade receivables 
were due from the Group’s largest customer and the five largest customers respectively. In order to minimize the credit risk, 
the management of Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits and credit approvals.

For trade receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach in HKFRS 9 to measure the loss allowance at lifetime ECL. The Group 
determines the ECL on these items by using a collective assessment grouped by internal credit rating.

Trade receivables from an associate and other receivables amounted to US$6,600,000 and US$122,131,000 (2020: US$4,240,000 and 
US$60,230,000) respectively have no fixed repayment terms. The Group has assessed these balances on a 12m ECL basis as there has been 
no significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition.

The estimated loss rates are estimated based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the debtors and 
forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. The grouping is regularly reviewed by management 
to ensure relevant information about specific debtors is updated.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group provided US$75,913,000 (2020: US$52,932,000) for credit losses 
allowances for trade receivables.

The Group writes off trade receivables when there is information indicating that the debtors are in severe financial difficulties 
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate 
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities.

As at December 31, 2021, the Group has available unutilized overdrafts facilities and short and medium term bank 
loan facilities of approximately US$323 million (2020: US$351 million) and US$2,248 million (2020: US$2,220 million) 
respectively.

Liquidity Tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities and derivative instruments. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flow of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 
which the Group can be required to pay. The maturity dates for non-derivative financial liabilities are based on agreed 
repayment dates. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that the interest flows are floating 
rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from the interest rate curve at the end of the reporting period.

In addition, the following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual net cash inflows and (outflows) on derivative instruments that settle 
on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross inflows and (outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When 
the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the foreign currency exchange 
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The liquidity analysis for the Group’s derivative financial instruments are 
prepared based on the contractual maturities/settlement as the management considers that the contractual maturities are 
essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.

Liquidity Tables (continued)
The amount included above for variable interest rate instruments for non-derivative financial liabilities is subject to change if 
changes in variable interest rates differ to those estimates of interest rate determined at the end of the reporting period.

36.2.6  INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM

Several of the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments, the interest of which are indexed to benchmark 
rates will be subject to the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group is closely monitoring the market and managing the 
transition to new benchmark interest rates, including announcements made by the relevant IBOR regulators.

LIBOR
The Financial Conduct Authority has confirmed all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no 
longer be representative:

• 

• 

immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 
1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and
immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings.

Risks arising from the interest rate benchmark reform

The following are the key risks for the Group arising from the transition:

Interest rate related risks
For contracts which have not been transitioned to the relevant alternative benchmark rates and without detailed fallback 
clauses, if the bilateral negotiations with the Group’s counterparties are not successfully concluded before the cessation 
of LIBORs, there are significant uncertainties with regard to the interest rate that would apply. This gives rise to additional 
interest rate risk that was not anticipated when the contracts were entered into.

There are fundamental differences between IBORs and the various alternative benchmark rates. IBORs are forward looking 
term rates published for a period (e.g. 3 months) at the beginning of that period and include an inter-bank credit spread, 
whereas alternative benchmark rates are typically risk-free overnight rates published at the end of the overnight period with 
no embedded credit spread. These differences will result in additional uncertainty regarding floating rate interest payments.

Liquidity risk
The additional uncertainty on various alternative rates which are typically published on overnight basis will require additional 
liquidity management. The Group’s liquidity risk management policy has been updated to ensure sufficient liquid resources 
to accommodate unexpected increases in overnight rates.

Litigation risk
If no agreement is reached to implement the interest rate benchmark reform on contracts which have not been transitioned 
to the relevant alternative benchmark rates (e.g. arising from differing interpretation of existing fallback terms), there is a 
risk of prolonged disputes with counterparties which could give rise to additional legal and other costs. The Group is working 
closely with all counterparties to avoid this from occurring.

Interest rate basis risk
Interest rate basis risk may arise if a non-derivative instrument and the derivative instrument held to manage the interest risk 
on the non-derivative instrument transition to alternative benchmark rates at different times. This risk may also arise where 
back-to-back derivatives transition at different times. If such a case arises, the Group will monitor this risk against its risk 
management policy which has been updated to allow for temporary mismatches of up to 12 months and transact additional 
basis interest rate swaps if required.

36.2.6  INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM (continued)

LIBOR (continued)
Progress towards implementation of alternative benchmark interest rates

The Group is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, primarily through its floating rate borrowings that require it to 
make interest payments based on LIBOR. The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to reduce its market risk from 
changes in interest rates.

The Group plans to transition the majority of its LIBOR linked contracts to risk-free rates through amendments to fallback 
clauses in its floating rate credit facilities and debt instruments which would change the basis for determining the interest rate 
cash flows from LIBOR to a risk-free rate at an agreed point in time.

LIBOR (continued)
Interest rate benchmark transition for derivatives

As at December 31, 2021, the Group had an outstanding notional balance of US$210,300,000 of USD LIBOR referenced 
cross-currency interest rate swaps which were in a cash flow hedge with the Group’s variable-rate US$ unsecured 
borrowings.

The Group has closely monitored the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition 
to new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators regarding the transition away from 
LIBOR. In response to the announcements, the Group has set up an LIBOR transition programme comprised of the following 
work streams: tax, treasury, legal, accounting and systems. The aim of the programme is to understand where LIBOR 
exposures are within the business and prepare and deliver on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative 
benchmark rates. None of the Group’s current LIBOR linked contracts include adequate and robust fall back provisions 
for a cessation of the referenced benchmark interest rate. Different working groups in the industry are working on fall back 
language for different instruments and different LIBORs, which the Group is monitoring closely and will look to implement 
these when appropriate.

For the Group’s cross-currency interest rate swaps, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (“ISDA”) fall back 
clauses were made available in the first quarter of 2021 and the Group is discussing with its banks with the aim to implement 
this language into its ISDA agreements within 2022.

The Group will continue to apply the amendments to HKFRS 9 until the uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark 
reforms with respect to the timing and the amount of the underlying cash flows that the Group is exposed ends. The Group 
has assumed that this uncertainty will not end until the Group’s LIBOR contracts are amended to specify the date on which 
the interest rate benchmark will be replaced, the cash flows of the alternative benchmark rate and the relevant spread 
adjustment. This will, in part, be dependent on the introduction of fall back clauses which have yet to be added to the 
Group’s contracts and the negotiation with lenders is underway.

Below are details of the hedging instruments and the related hedged items that have been or will be subject to transition to 
alternative benchmark interest rates, by hedge type. The terms of the hedged items listed match those of the corresponding

36.3  Fair Value

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

• 

• 

• 

• 

the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived 
from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contract;
the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is measured by the present value of future cash flows estimated and 
discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and foreign exchange rates between US$ 
and EUR, which is observable at the end of the reporting period;
the fair value of financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with 
reference to quoted market bid prices or latest purchase/transaction prices; and
the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The 
following table gives information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined (in 
particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used), as well as the level of the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value 
measurements are categorized (Levels 1 to 3) based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are 
observable.

•  Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 

liabilities;

•  Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 

observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

•  Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 

are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year, there was a transfer of financial asset of US$3,301,000 from level 2 to level 1 for one equity investment. The 
reason for the transfer was that the shares of the invested company have started being actively traded and reliable quoted price can 
be obtained in the market.

36.4  Transfers of financial assets

The following were the Group’s financial assets as at December 31, 2021 that were transferred to banks by discounting or 
factoring those trade and bills receivables on a full recourse basis. As the Group retained substantially all of the significant risks 
and rewards relating to these receivables, it continues to recognize the full carrying amount of the receivables and has recognized 
the cash received on the transfer as discounted bills with recourse (see Note 34) and unsecured borrowings – due within one year 
(see Note 37). These financial assets are carried at amortized cost in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.

The trade and bills receivables discounted with banks with full recourse at the year end was as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 202140.  Retirement Benefit Obligations
Defined Contribution Plans:
The Group operating in Hong Kong have participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (“MPF Schemes”) registered under the 
Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance since December 2000. The assets of the MPF Schemes are held separately from those of 
the Group, in funds under the control of trustees. The Group contributes 5% of relevant payroll cost to the MPF Schemes with a maximum 
amount of HK$18,000 (2020: HK$18,000) per employee per annum, which contribution is matched by the employee.

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are members of a state-managed retirement benefit 
scheme operated by the PRC government. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the 
retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make 
the specified contributions.

The Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes 
applicable to each year are made at a certain percentage of the employees’ payroll.

The total expense recognized in profit or loss of US$25,474,000 (2020: US$17,997,000) represents contributions payable to these plans 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Defined Benefits Plans:
The Group operates several defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Germany and the US, of which these plans 
cover substantially all remaining employees that are not covered by defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are administered 
by separate funds that are legally separated from the Group. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number of 
representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its articles of 
association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, employers. The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The major 
defined benefit plans are as follows:

Note i:  Pension plan obligations

The pension plan obligations are provided in the German operations and includes an unfunded plan that pays retirement benefits based on the term of service 
and final pay. In general, the benefit plans were closed to new members at the end of 1995. Under the plan, the qualifying employees are entitled to retirement 
benefits varying between 10% and 20% of final salary (based on the average of the last three years) on attainment of a retirement age of 65. The most recent 
actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out on January 1, 2022, by BDO AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, an 
independent valuer not related to the Group.

Note ii: Life and medical insurance plan

Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the US, operates unfunded life insurance plans. The most recent actuarial valuations of the 
present value of the obligations were carried out on December 23, 2021 by Willis Towers Watson, an independent valuer not related to the Group.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 202140.  Retirement Benefit Obligations (continued)

Defined Benefits Plans: (continued)
The plans in Germany and the US expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary 
risk.

Investment risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by 
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a 
plan deficit.

Interest rate risk

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.

Longevity risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the 
plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Salary risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependents of plan members (widow and orphan benefits) is reinsured by an external 
insurance company.

The main actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

Discount rate

Expected rate of salary increases

Future pension increases

At the end of the reporting period, the Group has unused tax losses of US$2,031 million (2020: US$1,916 million) available for offset 
against future taxable profits. Of the US$2,031 million of unused losses approximately US$447 million expire over the next 7 to 16 years 
with the remaining loss carryforwards having no useful life limitation. No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of tax losses of 
US$1,946 million (2020: US$1,802 million) due to the lack of probable future taxable profits.

In respect of all unrepatriated foreign earnings, the Group has provided deferred taxes of US$13 million (2020: US$13 million) as these 
unrepatriated foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested.

42.  Guarantees

The Company has given guarantees to banks in respect of general facilities granted to its subsidiaries. The extent of such facilities utilized 
by the subsidiaries as at December 31, 2021 amounted to US$670,896,000 (2020: US$83,227,000).

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2021 173

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 202143.  Share Options

Share Option Schemes
The Company has two share option schemes in place – Scheme D and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired 
on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, 
Scheme E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the eligible 
persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal terms 
of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:

(i) 

employees; or

(ii)  Directors; or

(iii) 

secondees; or

(iv) 

any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued 
by any member of the Group; or

(v) 

business partners; or

(vi) 

suppliers; or

(vii)  customers; or

(viii)  advisers of the Group.

Share options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by the 
Board for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at any time, subject to vesting conditions from the date of grant to the tenth 
anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share option; 
or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading days 
immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options may be granted under the respective share option scheme is not 
permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time or 10.0% of the shares in issue as at the 
adoption date of the respective share option scheme. No person shall be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as 
at the date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first or second anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of (i) the 
closing price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant; and (ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant.

The share options are vested in parts over 1 to 3 years from the date of grant.

Expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioral considerations.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the volatility of the share price. 
Because changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the directors’ opinion, the existing model 
does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the share options.

The weighted average closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the various dates on which the share options were 
granted during 2021 was HK$152.31 (2020: HK$98.44).

The closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the various dates on which the share options were granted ranged from 
HK$152.20 to HK$163.70 in 2021 (2020: ranged from HK$63.80 to HK$107.00).

The weighted average closing prices of the Company’s shares immediately before various dates during 2021 and 2020 on which the share 
options was exercised were HK$152.40 (2020: HK$83.11) respectively.

The Group recognized a total expense of US$13,935,000 (2020: US$3,209,000) for the year ended December 31, 2021 in relation to 
share options granted by the Company.

The fair value of the share options granted in 2021 measured at various dates on which the share options were granted was ranged from 
HK$36.67 to HK$39.49 (2020: ranged from HK$15.26 to HK$24.57). The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in 
2021 was HK$36.70 (2020: HK$22.73) per option.

The Company had 17,152,500 share options outstanding (2020: 15,795,000), which represented approximately 0.94% (2020: 0.86%) of 
the issued share capital of the Company as at December 31, 2021. No option (2020: Nil) was cancelled and no share options (2020: Nil) 
was lapsed during the year.

Total securities available for issue under Scheme D are 150,505,065 shares, which represented approximately 8.20% of the issued 
shares of the Company as at December 31, 2021. Total securities available for issue under Scheme E are 183,299,194 shares, which 
represented approximately 9.99% of the issued shares of the Company as at December 31, 2021.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  For the year ended December 31, 202144. Share Award Scheme

The purpose of the share award scheme is to recognize the contributions by certain eligible persons and to provide them with incentives 
in order to retain them for the continual operation and development of the Group and to attract suitable personnel for further development 
of the Group.

The share award scheme of the Company was adopted by the Board of Directors on January 9, 2008 and renewed on January 17, 2018. 
The Board may, from time to time, at their absolute discretion select any eligible person for participation in the scheme as a selected 
grantee and determine the number of shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The Board of Directors are required 
to pay the trustee the purchase price and the related expenses. The trustee must either purchase shares from the market or subscribe 
for new shares. The trustee must hold the shares until they are vested in accordance with the scheme rules. When the selected grantee 
has satisfied all vesting conditions specified by the Board of Directors at the time of making the award and becomes entitled to the shares 
forming the subject of the award, the trustee will transfer the relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of 
accrued interest) to the selected grantee.

An award of shares automatically lapses when, (i) a selected grantee who is an employee ceases to be an employee; or (ii) the subsidiary 
by which a selected grantee is employed ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company (or of a member of the Group); or (iii) a selected 
grantee who is a director of the Company or a subsidiary ceases to be a director of the same; or (iv) an order for the winding-up of the 
Company is made or a resolution is passed (otherwise than for certain purposes) for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, and, in any 
such case, the award, unless the Board otherwise agrees, automatically lapses forthwith and all the awarded shares and related income of 
such award do not vest on the relevant vesting date but become returned shares for the purpose of the scheme.

Recognition of share-based payment expenses under the share award scheme during the year was US$19,638,000 (2020: US$14,569,000). 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, 2,391,500 shares (2020: 2,364,000 shares) were transferred to the awardees upon vesting.
