Chairman’s Statement

“We have a bold, disciplined strategic 
plan for the next five years that focuses 
on the global leadership in our existing  
and future markets.”

Horst Julius Pudwill
Chairman

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

I am pleased to announce that in 2017 we  
delivered another year of record profit and  
our eighth consecutive year of record revenue.  
We have delivered impressive growth through  
the years while continuing to drive gross margin 
expansion. Our momentum couldn’t be stronger  
and we are highly confident in our disciplined focus  
on the key strategic drivers of powerful brands, 
innovative products, exceptional people, and 
operational excellence.

Record Performance
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 10.6% 
over 2016 to US$6.1 billion. We generated solid growth in all core 
geographic regions fueled by exciting new product launches across 
the divisions. Our largest business, Power Equipment, had another 
impressive year with sales growth of 14.9% to US$5.1 billion, 
accounting for 84.7% of total sales, and an increase in operating 
profit of 18.9% to US$512 million from US$430 million in 2016.  
The Floor Care and Appliance business made progress in enhancing 
its cordless product range while exiting certain non-strategic corded 
vacuums. With the cordless Floor Care business up double-digit,  
it is a testament to the effectiveness of our strategy to meet the 
consumer’s preference as the industry transitions from corded to 
cordless. We remain confident our direction will deliver improved 
returns in the coming years.

Continuous Operational Improvement
Gross profit margin improved for the ninth consecutive year from 
36.2% in 2016 to 36.7% on positive impacts from the flow of  
new product introductions, volume leverage and productivity gains.  
Our continued investment in automation, value engineering programs  
and relentless focus on global supply chain are also contributing to 
helping us achieve our exceptional results. Earnings before interest 
and taxes, increased by 15.3% to US$519 million, with the margin 
improving by 40 basis points to 8.6%. Shareholders’ profits rose 
15.0% to US$470 million, with earnings per share increasing by 
15.0% over 2016 to US25.66 cents. Working capital as a percent  
of sales continues to be very well managed and remained low at 
16.5% and in a net cash position.

Given the rapid growth of our Power Equipment division, TTI has 
made significant investments in the expansion of our distribution, 
manufacturing and R&D capabilities in North America with our head 
count increasing 16.0% in this region while global headcount for the 
entire Group increased only 6.7%, with revenue increasing 10.6%, 
demonstrating our ability to drive overall productivity.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of HK39.75 cents 
(approximately US5.12 cents) per share. Together, with the interim 
dividend of HK27.75 cents (approximately US3.57 cents) per share, 
this will result in a full-year dividend of HK67.50 cents (approximately 
US8.69 cents) per share, against HK50.00 cents (approximately 
US6.44 cents) per share in 2016, an increase of 35.0%.

Strategic Commitment
TTI has a clear focus on meeting our customers’ expectations with  
a relentless drive to create innovative products. Our commitment  
and investment in R&D combined with our cordless manufacturing 
capabilities have resulted in a flow of inventive product solutions that 
are advancing our cordless leadership position. We are leveraging  
our cordless technology as we drive further and more broadly across 
the battery platforms of RYOBI ONE+, the world’s largest cordless  
DIY power tool brand, and the industry leading MILWAUKEE M18  
and M12 professional and industrial power tool families. In addition 
to power tools, we utilize our technological expertise in batteries, 
power management electronics, and brushless motor systems in  
our Outdoor Power Equipment and Floor Care businesses.

We are committed to a culture of excellence at TTI. It is our high 
standards, willingness to take the necessary steps, and disciplined 
commitment to continuous improvement that are propelling TTI  
to continue delivering outstanding results. We are streamlining our 
manufacturing operations while at the same time reducing lead-times 
through the implementation of lean practices, automation, and supply 
chain reengineering. This dedication to operational excellence also 
drives the expansion of manufacturing capabilities necessary to 
launch a growing complex range of new products. Our technology 
and product development centers are energetic, dynamic places  
of creative ideas coupled with world-class project execution that  
bring remarkable ranges of breakthrough products to market. 
Enhancing our R&D capabilities is the new DIY power tools and 
outdoor power equipment Innovation Center in South Carolina  
and the recently completed Global New Product Development  
Center at the MILWAUKEE headquarters. These facilities are 
cutting-edge work environments for product creation, technical  
and software development.

Exciting Future
Our ambition is to fundamentally change the way the world works at 
home and on the jobsite. We continue to invest in the future through 
technology and product development teams that are driving the flow 
of innovative new products and creating opportunities for previously 
unimagined category expansion. We have a portfolio of powerful 
brands and leading cordless platforms which are being deployed 
across the globe.

2018 has started strong as we continue to execute our cordless vision 
and drive geographic and category expansion. Investment in cordless 
technology and our new product development process will generate 
an expanding flow of new products for 2018. New products and 
ground-breaking technologies like the MILWAUKEE FUEL and  
RYOBI brushless technology are being launched across our strategic 
cordless platforms of MILWAUKEE M12 and M18 and RYOBI ONE+ 
and 40V. New categories leveraging these cordless platforms are 
being entered and successfully expanded with industry changing 
innovations like MILWAUKEE High Output Lighting and Ryobi range  
of cordless Lawn Mowers. Our obsession on focusing on the customer 
is generating opportunities in complimentary Accessories, Storage 
and Hand Tool products. We are realizing substantial progress in 
expanding our global reach through the deployment of TTI’s brands 
and cordless leadership into strategically targeted geographies, many 
of these only now opening up to the benefits of cordless technology.

TTI is committed to operating as a responsible corporate citizen of the 
world with environmental, social and governance best practices as we 
grow the business.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my appreciation  
to our shareholders, loyal customers and everyone at TTI for their 
dedication, commitment and hard work. With our well-defined 
strategy, business momentum, and customer focus, I feel very 
confident that 2018 will be another outstanding year.

Chief Executive Officer’s Message

“We have an ambitious vision for a 
cordless future, a clear strategy going 
forward, strong business momentum  
and an inspired organization.”

Joseph Galli Jr
Chief Executive Officer

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

TTI delivered another year of outstanding performance 
in 2017. We are thriving as we ambitiously continue 
executing our laser focused strategy that created  
the platform for our industry-leading growth. TTI is 
leading the world’s rapid transition to cordless, 
displacing old technologies, entering new categories 
and expanding our served industries. Our vision for  
a cordless future is vast.

Global Cordless Leadership
Early on TTI identified the once in a generation shift from traditional 
power sources to cordless labor saving devices. We are driving  
the revolutionary change to cordless products away from traditional 
corded, pneumatic, hydraulic and gas power. We set a course to  
be the industry leader by bringing the disruptive cordless revolution 
with breakthrough innovative products into our product categories. 

Our strategic bedrock is the disciplined R&D investment necessary  
to deliver innovative product development which has been the key  
to our sustained performance. The advancements we have made  
in battery and motor technology coupled with new sophisticated 
electronic and charging systems have accelerated the corded to 
cordless transition into a true system wide expansion of cordless 
possibilities. This in turn has fueled cordless growth across all 
product categories. Whether it is RYOBI as the largest cordless  
DIY brand in the world, MILWAUKEE with its dominant industrial  
and professional tools leadership position, or HOOVER, VAX, and 
DIRT DEVIL brands commanding presence in global floor care,  
TTI is redefining how the world works at home and on the jobsite.

Powerful Brand Platforms
RYOBI is the number one DIY power tool brand in the world.  
The overarching reach of the RYOBI ONE+ system is a powerful 
platform for users, with over 120 power tools and outdoor products 
for use around the home and worksite. RYOBI ONE+ system has not 
changed in compatibility since introduction, generating a powerful 
network effect allowing existing users to upgrade, expand, and join 

the system with confidence. Innovative new products continue to 
attract new users to the system with breakout products like the  
high performance brushless drywall gun and AIRSTRIKE range’s  
23 gauge pin nailer as well as category expanding products such as 
the worksite EVERCHARGE area light and cordless cleaning debris 
sweeper, 6 gallon wet/dry vac and pool vacuum.

RYOBI in outdoor products is driving the evolution from gas powered 
products to the environmentally friendly cordless technology  
which is quieter, easy to use, and with the accelerating technology 
development, is equaling and surpassing performance of gas 
powered alternatives. Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment  
are important sources of non-road air pollutants and our cordless 
outdoor products are making a positive impact for the environment.  
The success of our RYOBI cordless mower family of eighteen 
models utilizing the ONE+ and 40V cordless systems demonstrates 
the impact of cordless on previously entrenched technologies and 
competitors. Mowers are a major growth area and is one category  
of many outdoor products that have our dedicated focus.

TTI has developed a long term strategy for floor care with our iconic 
HOOVER, DIRT DEVIL, ORECK and VAX brands. We are focusing  
on cordless and carpet washing products while acknowledging  
that the traditional corded vacuum market is evaporating. The new 
VAX BLADE and HOOVER REACT, IMPULSE and FUSION cordless 
stick vacs are from our new product roadmap. The reframed business 
will require disciplined strategic implementation, but early results are 
encouraging and we believe we have a winning plan for the future.

MILWAUKEE, with the vast M12, M18 and FUEL product ranges,  
is the fastest growing, most innovative and leading brand of cordless 
tools for the industrial and professional user. MILWAUKEE is expanding 
growth opportunities through the systematic introduction of disruptive 
new products with specific solutions aimed at electrical, mechanical, 
plumbing and remodeling. Our technologically advanced new cordless 
high-output lighting, FORCELOGIC hydraulics, and drain cleaning 
products represent significant improvement in productivity, safety, 
and product performance. We are truly excited that our revolutionary 
range of next generation products are reshaping the industrial 
landscape across a growing number of categories.

Driving Innovative Products
We are pioneering innovation in product categories through cordless 
technology. TTI remains committed to bringing cordless into new 
targeted product categories and growing existing product categories. 
Our success in these arenas has been unprecedented. To sustain 
and nurture this success we have built a world-class R&D capability 
and new product development process delivering speed-to-market 
competitive advantage. Leveraging our manufacturing expertise  
and product innovation process on our advancements in cordless 
technology, we are creating significant changes in the markets  
we serve, making gains across all product categories. Our R&D 
capabilities and extensive research reach deep into technology, 
engineering, software development and design, envisioning and 
producing the next generation of cordless products.

The rapid transition to cordless tools is still in its early stages and  
we are confident that the opportunities arising from this shift are 
virtually unlimited. We expect significant growth from TTI’s new  
product pipeline which is unmatched in technology, scale and 
speed-to-market.

Geographic Expansion Success
TTI has been successfully building upon our strong foundation  
in the US market while making important gains in targeted, 
underrepresented geographies around the world. We have worked 
hard to significantly improve our market positions in Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe and now Eastern Europe. 
We have a selective and focused process for geographic expansion 
which includes bold investment in the target markets of South Korea, 
Taiwan, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and  
other strategic geographies.

the powerful future that lies ahead. We have built an enviable 
platform with massive long term potential. We are just getting started.

performance with broad user acceptance. The 20” 40V mower 
expands an already successful range and brings excellent 
performance with industry best performance. More and more  
DIY end users are moving to the convenience of cordless products 
when working outdoors.

Floor Care and Appliances
The Floor Care and Appliance business declined 8.3% and 
accounted for 15.3% of TTI sales. With our outstanding brand 
portfolio including HOOVER, DIRT DEVIL, ORECK and VAX, the 
business is focusing on high growth cordless products and leveraging 
the TTI cordless technology. Sales of cordless vacuums grew 
double-digit across all geographies, validating our strategic plan 
aimed at increased profitability and a return to top line growth  
in the long term. The business is making progress executing the 
strategic changes by investing in R&D for cordless technology  
and new product development, discontinuation of non-strategic 
products and streamlining operations. During the year we invested  
in new production lines for our cordless products at our world class 
manufacturing facility. This is a critical step as we leverage our larger 
cordless power tool core competencies in floor care manufacturing.

North America

The North America business delivered growth in the cordless 
segment highlighted by the successful launch of the HOOVER REACT 
cordless pole vacuum and HOOVER FUSION cordless vacuum,  
both with market leading run time and performance of the ONE PWR 
cordless battery system with rapid charge. The new HOOVER power 
scrub range of carpet extractors gained momentum in the second 
half of 2017 and represents the start of a new portfolio of carpet 
extractors and accompanying cleaning solutions.

The DIRT DEVIL brand had an outstanding year outpacing the 
industry by growing at a double-digit rate. This was a result of 
successful product launches with the POWER MAX series of uprights 
and a range of cordless REACH MAX pole vacuums targeted toward 
the on-the-go millennial consumer. Our digital marketing and social 
media campaigns are proving highly effective in growing this segment 
of the market.

Our ORECK brand introduced a range of cordless pole vacuums, 
incorporating new-to-world POD technology, providing an unsurpassed 
“clean air” management system. This powerful technology offers 
significant user benefits for the ORECK platform going forward. 
ORECK products are supported with a direct to consumer model  
and highly impactful digital marketing campaign. Additionally, the 
Hoover Commercial Cleaning business had a solid year with the 
expansion of its customer base in cordless cleaning with back  
packs and HUSHTONE cordless uprights. The HUSHTONE upright  
is the leading commercial cordless upright and expands our  
battery network.

Europe

Floor Care business in Europe delivered strong growth in the  
strategic cordless stick vacuum category. In 2017 the innovative 
BLADE cordless stick vac was introduced in the UK market. 
Launching with two variants, both the BLADE 24V and BLADE 32V 
cordless stick vacs proved to be an immediate success with 
consumers adopting the efficient cleaning performance and long 
runtime of 35 minutes and 45 minutes respectively. The new floor 
cleaning head and DIRECT HELIX technology optimize airflow at  
all angles to maximize performance and efficiency. Following the 
successful UK launch, the BLADE cordless stick vac was launched 
across Europe and is achieving strong sales. We have a next 
generation BLADE in the pipeline which will further drive growth  
in the cordless floor care category in 2018. Another new product 
success is the VAX rapid power pro carpet washer offering our  
fastest ever carpet drying time and achieved our highest ever 
consumer rating.

Our Commitment to ESG
As a responsible corporate citizen, TTI is committed to operating  
its business in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
best practices, and to considering the views of stakeholders as it 
enhances and grows the business sustainably. The Directors oversee 
the company’s management of ESG performance and compliance 
with all applicable legal and other requirements. TTI is vigilant to 
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the  
areas in which it does business and certifies compliance across all  
of its business units on a bi-annual basis. It is not believed that any 
particular law or regulation would have a material effect on the 
business. TTI has many measures at its disposal and checks and 
balances to ensure that were it found to be noncompliant in any  
given area, it could quickly bring its operations into compliance and 
mitigate the risks. TTI implements systems to manage risk and audits 
performance to ensure compliance with all local laws, regulations  
and standards related to corporate governance, business operations, 
employment, health and safety and the environment.

The company recognizes the importance of relationships with key 
stakeholders to the success of the business, to the retention and 
recruitment of leading talent, to the continued innovation of TTI’s 
products, and to enhancing the sustainability of its operations and 
supply chain. Regular communication with regulatory authorities, 
shareholders and investors, business partners, customers, suppliers 
and employees is essential for being aware of and meeting evolving 
requirements and expectations.

Detail on how TTI integrates sustainability into the business, meets  
its ESG commitments and legal and other requirements, and  
engages with stakeholders is provided throughout this report and

compared to US$641 million in 2016.

EBIT amounted to US$519 million, an increase of 15.3% as 
compared to US$450 million in 2016.

Gross Margin

Gross margin improved to 36.7% as compared to 36.2% last year. 
The margin improvement was the result of new product introduction, 
product mix, category expansion, improvements in operational 
efficiency and supply chain productivity.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the year amounted to US$1,712 million 
as compared to US$1,540 million in 2016, representing 28.2%  
of turnover (2016: 28.1%). The increase was mainly due to the 
strategic investments in new products.

Investments in product design and development amounted to 
US$164 million, representing 2.7% of turnover (2016: 2.7%) 
reflecting our continuous strive for innovation. We will continue to 
invest in breakthrough technology and deliver broad base end-user 
products and categories as these are most critical not only to 
maintain sales growth momentum but also margin expansions.

Net interest expenses for the year amounted to US$14 million  
as compared to US$10 million in 2016, an increase of 35.0%.  
The increase mainly due to the increase in the volume of business 
and interest rate increased during the year. In view of the potential 
further rate increase, the Company will focus in managing  
its financial resources to be more efficient going forward.  
Interest coverage, expressed as a multiple of EBITDA to  
total interest was 30.2 times (2016: 30.0 times).

The effective tax rate, being tax charged for the year to before  
tax profits was at 6.9% (2016: 7.1%). The Group will continue  
to leverage its global operations and align its strategy to cope  
with various tax policies change globally to further improve overall

Liquidity and Financial Resources

Shareholders’ Funds

Total shareholders’ funds amounted to US$2.7 billion as compared  
to US$2.4 billion in 2016. Book value per share was at US$1.49  
as compared to US$1.31 last year, an increase of 13.7%.

Financial Position

The Group continued to maintain a strong financial position.

50.2%, 21.6%, 7.6% and 20.6% were denominated in US$, RMB, 
EUR and other currencies respectively.

The Group’s net gearing, expressed as a percentage of total net 
borrowing (excluding bank advance from factored trade receivables 
which are without recourse in nature) to equity attributable to Owners 
of the Company, improved from 5.2% in 2016 to net cash. The 
gearing improvement is the result of very disciplined and focused 
management over working capital. The Group remains confident  
that gearing, if any, will remain low going forward.

Bank Borrowings

Long term borrowings accounted for 66.5% of total debts (2016: 52.8%).

The Group’s major borrowings continued to be in US Dollars. 
Borrowings are predominantly LIBOR based. There is a natural  
hedge mechanism in place as the Group’s major revenues are in  
US Dollars and currency exposure therefore is low. Currency, interest 
rate exposures, and cash management functions are all being closely 
monitored and managed by the Group’s treasury team.

Amongst the bank borrowings, fixed rate debts account for 12.3%  
of the total debt, the balance being floating rate debts.

The internal audit function is essential to provide an independent and 
objective assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board in 
controlling the internal business environment. The Internal Auditor 
reports periodically to the Audit Committee and meets the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee regularly. The internal audit function maintain 
independent review continuously on key business aspects in 
accordance with the annual audit plan, and report the key findings to 
the Board through the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee and the external auditors of the Group meet 
twice a year without the presence of the management of the Group to 
enhance independent reporting by external auditors of the Group. In 
order to maintain effective communication with shareholders, the 
external auditors attended the 2017 Annual General Meeting to 
answer questions about the accounting policies, the auditor 
independence, the conduct of the audit and the preparation and 
content of the auditors’ report.

The procedures and internal controls for handling and disseminating 
of inside information are governed by the Model Code, the Code for 
Securities Transactions by Relevant Employees, the Whistle Blowing 
Policy, the Policy on Market Disclosure, Investor and Media Relations 
with a view to ensure compliance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and the statutory and regulatory requirements that 
the Group is subject to.

In light of the above reviews and policies, the Board confirms that 
the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems are 
effective and adequate.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

Overview
Our mission statement of “Powerful Brands – 
Innovative Products – Exceptional People – 
Operational Excellence” is truly what drives  
the sustainable evolution of our business.  
TTI’s commitment to sustainability is affirmed by 
focused efforts to ingrain environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors within our business culture, 
through our employees and with our outside partners. 
We believe in a sustainable business that emphasizes 
our exceptional people and products, while 
responsibly managing our environmental footprint 
and improving social conditions in our supply chain 
and in the communities where we do business.

This report highlights the ESG initiatives of TTI’s global business 
units. We have operations in 41 locations around the world,  
which vary in size from having thousands of employees to only  
a few. Manufacturing, research and development, sales and 
marketing, and administrative duties are all conducted in our Asia, 
Europe and United States locations. Our locations in Canada  
and Australia/New Zealand operate as sales and marketing  
and administrative offices. Information has been collectively  
gathered from our facilities in North America, Europe, Asia and 
Australia/New Zealand to present our policies and performance. 
Through this report, we strive to help investors and other stakeholders 
understand how we approach ESG issues, what we are doing in  
these areas and what we can do better to further sustainability  
in our own operations and the supply chain through internal and 
external change.

ESG Management
This year, TTI established an ESG Working Committee to advance  
a long-term cohesive sustainability strategy. The ESG Working 
Committee will assist TTI and its Board of Directors to identify ESG 
risks and assess whether these ESG risks are principal risks for the 
business and the Company. By recognizing environmental and social 
issues, risks and opportunities associated with business operations, 
the ESG Working Committee is developing a sustainability strategy  
to unify our processes, not only at the business unit level, but at  
a corporate level. Our ESG Working Committee is chaired by the  
Chief Compliance Officer and consists of members representatives of 
varying company functions from each business unit across the globe.

How our Businesses View their  
Contribution to ESG
TTI is developing global key performance indicators (“KPIs”)  
and targets as part of its sustainability strategy. To understand  
local strategies and targets, the ESG Working Committee asked  
TTI’s businesses to identify their ESG risks, concerns, strategies, 
achievements, areas for improvement, and challenges to better  
gauge how TTI can improve its sustainability initiatives to positively 
impact each of our regions and collectively, TTI. The main risks  
and priorities identified are the environmental impact of our 
manufacturing operations, our products and managing our footprint, 
as well as the environmental and social impact and risk within our 
supply chain. By proactively and responsibly managing these risks, 
we seek to create opportunities through engaging our stakeholders to 
improve performance in our operations and supply chain.

Regional ESG Achievements

TTI Canada: At TTI Canada, we are most proud of our Exceptional 
People, Operational Excellence and Commitment to the Communities 
in which we do business. The foundation of our organization is  
its people. At TTI Canada, we invest heavily in developing current  
and future leaders through recruitment, training and recognition 
programs. That investment in development, combined with a strong  
promote-from-within culture leads to strong, effective leadership, 
which keeps our company strategically focused on facing often 
unpredictable market forces.

Execution is the other side of the innovation coin. Without it, ideas 
remain ideas. At TTI Canada, we are passionate about being the very 
best in every aspect of our operation. We closely examine every detail 
from design engineering to supply chain logistics to eliminate waste 

and improve productivity. Our operational teams have driven scalability 
utilizing our resources at a global level. In Canada, our business has 
grown by an astounding 55% since 2008. This tremendous growth 
has been fueled by hiring and retaining the best people.

At TTI Canada, we believe that “exceptional people drive exceptional 
results”. We also believe that to be an “exceptional company” we 
must support and give back to the communities in which we work. 
We survey employees to identify charities for engagement, with a 
focus on ones that have a team building component. To that end,  
TTI Canada employees have been walking, riding, stuffing stockings, 
climbing stairs, playing volleyball, working on construction sites, 
donating and participating in events to support a number of  
national and local charities.

TTI FC NA: We contracted with an electronics recycler to recycle  
all electronic components of returned/scrapped units. This includes 
all batteries, power cords, power adapters, etc., in addition to 
computer monitors and televisions. In Cookeville, TN we developed  
a Behavior-based Safety Program to observe and communicate  
with employees one-on-one concerning safe and unsafe behaviors.

Managing our Environmental Footprint
As an industry leader and a globally-recognized business, TTI is 
committed to managing our operations responsibly, conserving 
resources and minimizing our environmental footprint. We owe it to 
the communities we serve and the planet we inhabit to do the right 
thing. We are therefore committed to upholding environmental laws 
and regulations and reducing environmental impact through our 
established resource management, reuse and recycling policies  
and through the design of our products and facilities. TTI promotes 
sustainable practices in all our operations and our environmental 
priorities include:

• 

• 

• 

Preventing pollution

Conserving energy and natural resources

Reducing emissions and discharges

•  Minimizing waste and increasing reuse and recycling

• 

• 

• 

• 

Safely using and disposing of hazardous materials and waste

Development of environmentally-sound alternatives

Preventing accidents

Being an industry leader in encouraging the migration from 
older technologies to newer, more environmentally-efficient 
technologies, including:

o 

o 

Leading the industry on the development and introduction 
of low CO2 generators which have been praised by the US 
Environmental Protection Agency

Leading the industry in the adoption and expansion of 
cordless lithium battery technology, which reduces the use 
of NiCd and NiMH batteries and gas-powered products.

The environmental aspects of TTI’s manufacturing operations 
predominantly involve exhaust gas, noise, hazardous material and 
waste management, and resource and energy consumption. All of 
TTI’s operations implement environmental policies and procedures  
to meet laws and regulations and we identify our environmental risks 
and take precautions against environmental accidents. In 2017,  
TTI was in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations  
with the exception of our operations in Zhuhai, which received 
administrative penalties (including fines totaling US$62,756.56)  
due to non-compliance with local environmental laws. The nature 
and extent of the incident is not significant, nor material to TTI’s 
business and operation in the PRC. TTI has worked closely with  
the local environmental bureau to implement measures to rectify  
the situation to ensure full compliance. To deliver sustainable value  
to our employees, customers and business partners, we are mindful 
of our role in protecting the environment, and do so by implementing 
policies and onsite systems, and conducting periodic audits and 
regulatory inspections at our production and distribution facilities.

We adopt best practice standards with a relentless focus on 
improvement through our quality and hazardous substance 
management systems (i.e. ISO9001 and QC080000), striving to 
produce defect-free products. Annual investments are made to 
improve the environmental performance of our facilities, which 
ensures that our operations not only meet the requirements of laws 
and regulations, but also the expectations of our customers. We are 
also sharpening our focus on environmental management, setting 
objectives and targets, and raising the awareness and skills of our 
people, with further overall improvement planned in the future.

Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Management of Air Emissions
TTI determines which aspects have and can have a significant  
impact on the environment, thus providing the basis for establishing 
emission objectives and targets. Where possible and measurable,  
TTI monitors, measures and retains proper documented emission 
information to analyze and evaluate the results. Throughout TTI’s 
business, GHG emissions arise from energy consumption for our 
electricity and heating, our transportation and our manufacturing 
processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide 
(NO2) are emitted from cars, trucks and other small machinery and 
from combustion processes to generate electricity for manufacturing, 
lighting and building management systems and heating and cooling. 
Fluorinated gases, such as HCFC-22, R-410a and R-404a are also 
consumed as refrigerants.

TTI AIP in Dongguan, PRC is TTI’s largest facility and largest 
manufacturing operation. To assess and manage GHG emissions 
including data collection, manual establishment, reporting and 
auditing, the departments of Quality System Assurance (“QSA”) and 
Environmental Health Safety (“EHS”) work together. Together, QSA 
and EHS quantify and analyze GHG emissions annually and against 
previous years to identify opportunities to further energy conservation 
and emission reduction in the future.

We are working to globally collect the GHG emissions from all  
our business units to provide a more comprehensive reporting of  
our emissions in total and in intensity. While TTI currently is not 
consistently tracking GHG emissions at every location, we have made 
significant strides in implementing measures to mitigate emissions. 
For example, our business units have taken the following measures:

SF6

Sulfur Hexafluoride
• High voltage switchgear

•

TTI Canada has moved away from V8 engines in pickup trucks 
to more efficient V6 engines. This has conserved 81,000 litres  
of fuel on an annual basis and reduced sulphur oxide (SOX), 
CO2, CH4 and N2O by 7%.

TTI PE installed new energy-efficient heating systems in the 
recent construction of its distribution center and is installing 
energy-efficient heating systems to its new office, which is 
currently under construction.

In 2017, TTI AIP reduced carbon dioxide emissions by  
781 tonnes over 2016 through energy-efficient measures 
throughout the facility2.

The GHG emissions data is verified by Intertek and reflects 2016. The GHG 

emissions for 2017 will be verified in June 2018.

This data is not yet verified.

To reduce the GHG emissions from electricity consumption,  
TTI HK administrative personnel monitor the operation of 
air-conditioning systems. This has resulted in a 5% reduction  
in CO2 emissions from 0.555 tonnes of CO2 per employee in 
2016 to 0.525 tonnes per employee in 2017.

TTI Benelux has replaced some conventional fuel cars with 
electric ones. With the planned investment of at least five more 
electric cars, GHG emissions will be reduced by over 17%.

Energy-saving lighting has been installed throughout  
DreBo’s facility.

TTI MEA minimizes the use of air-conditioning in the office  
at night and over weekends.

Energy Consumption
As TTI continues to grow, total energy demand continues to rise.  
TTI is investigating how to balance a global policy with the PRC being 
one of the largest primary energy consumers in the world and other 
regions like North America and Europe, where energy consumption 
has decreased. TTI monitors renewable energy sources that are 
becoming more cost-effective.

At TTI AIP Electricity and Natural Gas Consumption, Production 
Value and Intensity Data is as follows3:

TTI AIP Electricity (kWh)
TTI AIP Natural gas (m3)
TTI AIP Production Value (million USD)
Intensity of Electricity (kWh per million USD)

As TTI constructs new facilities, remodels existing facilities or remains 
at current facilities, we are implementing programs to become more 
energy efficient. While some business units are tracking results, others 
are establishing monitoring programs for reporting on all energy 
sources and consumption. The following actions have been taken in 
our facilities around the world:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Construction of new facilities with instant hot water and 
water-saving fixtures has resulted in efficiencies at TTI PE.

A Continuous Improvement Program (CIP) at TTI AIP has saved 
electric power consumption by 846,313 kWh from 2016 to 2017.

TTI AIP has established targets to control natural gas 
consumption, which is monitored to ensure targets are met.

TTI ANZ’s corporate office in Rowville is a 6 Star Energy Rated 
building. Mechanical services such as air conditioners and 
lighting are set to timers.

Power controls are applied for lighting and fan-coil units to be 
turned off after office hours at TTI HK.

Through central administrative control, electricity consumption 
has remained flat between 2016 and 2017 at TTI HK.

At Empire, LED lighting has been installed throughout the plant 
and the HVAC control system has been upgraded. Additionally, 
Empire has been able to reclaim heat generated from air 
compressors and extrusion operations.

TTI FC NA facility converted from a compressed air-drying 
system in the refurbishing department to a simple fan system, 
thereby decreasing electricity usage.

TTI Zhuhai has changed fluorescent lights to LED and regularly 
checks air compressors and air pipes to avoid leakage.

TTI is working toward an initiative to better manage and record our 
direct and indirect energy consumptions by type, in total and intensity.

Water Management
It is important for TTI to manage its water use efficiently and 
maximize its beneficial use. Water for all TTI locations is sourced 
locally, and we have not experienced any issues with water sourcing. 
In fact, all facilities in North America are in compliance with 
regulatory requirements and TTI’s facilities in the US comply with  
the Clean Water Act. Currently, TTI does not have a policy in place  
to manage water use, but we continue to investigate options to best 
collect water consumption and intensity data per facility.

In 2017, water consumption at TTI HK increased from 571 m3 in 
2016 to 678 m3. However, the increase was due to a workforce 
expansion. Yet, recognizing the need for water management, many  
of our office facilities have replaced traditional faucets and toilets  
with motion sensors or included motion sensors with new building 
designs, thus helping to eliminate water wastage and reduce energy 
consumption. At TTI AIP, our largest facility, we recycle wastewater 
and reusable wastewater is used for watering the flowers.

In addition to office use, our TTI FC NA facility uses water in its  
process to cool injection molding machines and to wash parts in  
the refurbishing operation. Injection molding coolant water is in a 
closed-loop system so there is virtually no discharge into the local 
sewer system. The refurbishing operation uses water mixed with a 
biodegradable cleanser that can be disposed of into the city sewer 
system for treatment.

Packaging
TTI makes a concerted effort to use packaging material that is 
recyclable. Notably, Milwaukee Tool uses biodegradable packaging 
and paper. Similarly, TTI FC NA uses corrugated cardboard or chip 
board as packaging in all its products, both of which are recyclable 
by the end user. At TTI PE, recyclable corrugated cardboard, 
honeycomb board, chipboard, paperboard and molded pulp are  
all used. Additionally, TTI PE uses expanded polystyrene, plastic  
and steel crates for its lawn mowers.

At TTI AIP, our largest facility, we have implemented a recycling 
program for waste packaging materials and wastewater. Reusable 
waste water is used for watering the flowers. TTI AIP has also 
improved its production process to enhance production efficiency 
and reduce raw material waste.

TTI ANZ belongs to the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, 
Ltd. (“APCO”), which is a sustainable packaging initiative, of which 
the goal is to change the culture of business to design more sustainable 
packaging, increase recycling rates and reduce packaging litter.  
TTI ANZ aims to reduce the amount of unnecessary packing and/or 
packaging for our products by reusing packing whenever possible to 
prevent it from going into the landfill. The TTI ANZ warehouse also 
recycles its pallets.

Similarly, TTI Zhuhai recycles and reuses suppliers’ packaging to 
avoid creating additional waste.

TTI is working on a process that will allow us to better track the type 
and quantity of packaging generated throughout our business units.

Management of Waste
TTI is a leader in the market of innovative power tools, floor care 
products, outdoor gardening products, and electronic products,  
with renowned brands, characterized by state-of-the-art design, 
advanced technology, innovative promotion and our market-leading 
position. Top brands for the TTI Group’s products include the power 
tools of MILWAUKEE, AEG, RYOBI and HOMELITE power tools;  
RYOBI, DIRT DEVIL, ORECK, and VAX floor care products; and 
RYOBI and HOMELITE outdoor products.

As a leader in the design and manufacturing of lithium ion batteries, 
our batteries are designed to be interchangeable within the brand  
of products. This technology drastically reduces battery waste.  
TTI has partnered with Call2Recycle Inc., where customers can 
recycle unusable batteries instead of throwing them away. Customers 
in the US and Canada can also go to www.call2recycle.org to find the 
nearest battery recycling drop box so those batteries can be properly 
transferred to recycling facilities.

Minimizing the Impact on the Environment and 
Natural Resources
TTI’s goal is to minimize our environmental footprint and conserve 
our natural resources. We continue to implement practices for 
reducing resource consumption and the impact on the environment 
and natural resources through our established resource management, 
reuse and recycling policies and through the design of our products 
and facilities.

For our administrative offices, TTI promotes environmentally-responsible 
behavior and raises awareness on important environmental issues. 
Regular communications and reminders such as “Housekeeping 
Guidelines”, “Red Packet Recycling” and “Keep the Office Green 
During Your Holidays” are sent to employees at TTI HK. Employees at 
other administrative facilities are provided with high volume printers 
set for double-sided and black and white printing. Reusable dishware 
is provided in all kitchen areas to minimize waste.

We support all of our people to being environmentally-conscious  
and encourage our employees to recycle paper and other recyclable 
products within the office. Regular maintenance of air-conditioning, 
heating, ventilation and building management systems is conducted 
to maintain facilities’ energy efficiency and healthy indoor air quality. 
At TTI HK, routine announcements with the caption – “Going Green  
in the Office” have been shared to encourage employees to  
reduce their GHG footprints by conserving energy and adopting 
energy-efficiency measures.

Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Depending on the operations at each of our locations, the 
mechanisms for handling hazardous and non-hazardous waste 
varies. However, TTI remains vigilant to comply with local laws and 
regulations and building management procedures regarding the 
disposal of materials. Operations that generate hazardous waste  
have scheduled pick-ups by licensed haulers for safe disposal and 
TTI ANZ is currently developing a hazardous waste recycling program.

For non-hazardous waste, all offices properly dispose of their waste 
and where local facilities are available, have recyclables collected for 
recycling. The majority of our facilities’ office and building management 
services provide separate bins for recyclables and properly dispose  
of solid and hazardous waste through local providers. TTI AIP has 
improved its production process to enhance production efficiency 
and reduce raw material waste.

While TTI FC NA has the ability to remove electronic parts and ferrous 
metals from returned products, currently the non-ferrous metals  
and plastic parts are ground up and disposed of as non-hazardous 
waste in a local landfill. In 2017, this amounted to approximately 
750,000 pounds of material. TTI FC NA is seeking ways in which the 
non-ferrous metals can be recycled or reused.

TTI is working toward a method to track the types of waste disposed 
of by business units. In fact, TTI FC NA is researching how to reduce 
the potential for returned products being disposed of to landfills.

For comparison, the amount of waste generated by TTI AIP and 
North America are provided below:

Our Commitment to Employees
TTI has a long-standing commitment to promoting and maintaining 
an environment that respects the personal rights and dignity of our 
employees. It has been and shall continue to be both the official 
policy and the commitment of TTI to provide equal employment 
opportunity for all qualified persons, without regard to race, gender, 
color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, 
age, religion, military service, status as an individual with a disability 
or status as a veteran or any other status protected by applicable 
local, state or national law. It is our belief that all individuals should 
be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of any differences that 
arise in the workplace.

Each TTI business unit has an Employee Handbook written 
specifically for their location that incorporates all employment 
policies, procedures and best practices. The Handbook incorporates 
national and local regulations to ensure compliance in every region. 
Handbooks are updated as required to reflect any new changes to 
national and/or local laws or policies.

TTI’s policies and procedures align with our mission of being a company 
of exceptional people, and extend to recruiting, interviewing, hiring, 
assignment of responsibilities, transfer, promotion, training, hours  
of work, rest periods, pay benefits, disciplinary actions, termination, 
and any other terms and conditions of employment. Employees are 
required to read and sign off on the Employee Handbook upon their 
hiring, as well as when changes are made.

In the U.S., TTI’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) policy, as 
well as its affirmative action obligations, have the full and complete 
support of business unit presidents and TTI’s CEO. Through the  
EEO Policy and affirmative action obligations, our business units 
encourage initiatives and personal leadership by all employees as  
the best means to ensure the success of the program. By respecting 
differences, embracing similarities and understanding their impact, 
we create an environment in which all employees are welcomed, 
encouraged to participate fully, and accorded respect.

Additionally, we expect all employees to adhere to the laws applicable 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate and to refrain from 
mistreating others through threats, violent behavior, intimidation, 
bullying, discrimination, physical or verbal abuse, unwelcome  
sexual advances, unwelcome touching or invasion of personal  
space, or ignoring the rights of others. Our Harassment Prevention, 
Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Retaliation Policy provides the overall 
philosophy and specific approaches for addressing discrimination, 
harassment and related retaliation issues. All employees are required 
to take an eLearning course on Preventing Harassment and Violence 
in the Workforce.

Our commitment to employees also includes providing fair and 
equitable benefits to all qualified persons. At TTI Canada, we look 
outside to other Top 100 Companies to stay competitive and attract 
the best talent so we can identify best practices and adopt those for 
our employees. TTI Canada also pays 100% of its offered benefits for 
its full-time employees. The benefit offering is reviewed by the human 
resources and finance departments on an annual basis to ensure we 
offer competitive and relevant benefits to our employees.

In the United States, TTI offers a comprehensive employee benefit 
program that covers the full range of health, life, disability and 
retirement benefits for our employees and their dependents. 
Programs are benchmarked annually against other major U.S. 
employers and TTI’s offerings consistently compare favorably.  
In addition to traditional employee benefit offerings, TTI has programs 
and policies to address family leave, annual leave/vacation, and 
educational assistance. All benefits, programs and policies are provided 
on a uniform basis to all full-time and part-time permanent employees.

Similarly, TTI ANZ benchmarks all employee benefits against 
competitors and industry local practices to ensure we are recognized 
as an employer of choice. TTI ANZ provides educational, financial, 
social and health benefits that are above and beyond traditional 
employee benefits.

Safeguarding the Health and Safety of  
our Exceptional People
TTI is committed to providing employees with safe working 
conditions. We are proud to report that we have not had any 
work-related fatalities in 2017 at any of our 41 locations around  
the world. Our employees should not only feel respected and valued 
while at work, but should also feel secure in their surroundings. 
Measures have been taken to eliminate and reduce hazards where 
possible through Environmental Health & Safety (“EHS”) and 
Occupational Hazard Management Policies, as well as other internal 
policies and local regulations. Any safety issues or violations of 
regulatory requirements are addressed promptly to prevent risk  
of injury.

We also take proactive initiatives to make safety a top priority 
throughout TTI’s business. The following are a few examples  
of specifics.

At TTI FC NA, we have a well-organized safety committee comprised 
of both management and hourly workers. TTI FC NA conducts 
regular safety audits throughout the TTI FC NA facilities, performs  
job safety analyses followed by education to workers on the safe way 
to perform their jobs, and trains both hourly and management 
personnel on performing behavior-based safety audits by observing 
employees while they work and then discussing the safe and  
unsafe actions and observations. TTI FC NA also has each employee 
sign a safety pledge indicating that they will perform their jobs in  
a safe manner.

Furthermore, TTI FC NA has certified, first-aid/CPR responders in  
all areas of the facility to respond to any emergencies that may arise 
during working hours. TTI FC NA also trains the leadership team to 
be safety coaches for their employees. Training is completed through 

a combination of instructor led and online training. Work-place safety 
initiatives and safety incidents are monitored by the Director of  
EHS, the EHS Associate and the joint management/employee  
safety committee.

TTI Canada follows a similar health and safety approach to TTI FC NA. 
TTI Canada has a Health and Safety (“H&S”) Committee that meets 
quarterly to review health and safety activities. Members of the H&S 
Committee comprise representatives from the corporate location and 
its five (5) service branches, as well as representation from the field. 
Provincial Health and Safety Regulation booklets are posted at each 
of the locations, along with the minutes of each meeting as per the 
policy. Provincial Health and Safety Ministry officials make periodic 
visits to the sites to ensure compliance. Managers at each site also 
conduct ongoing inspections to affirm first aid kits, fire extinguishers 
and defibrillators are in proper working order and well stocked. TTI 
Canada also provides access to First Aid courses for all employees.

When proper health care is not available in various regions, TTI has 
stepped in to ensure our employees and their families are receiving 
adequate health care. For example, in Greenwood, Mississippi, 
Milwaukee Tool established the Greenwood Clinic that operates  
within our Greenwood plant for employees and their family members. 
This was put in place due to the lack of primary care doctors in  
that area. It has and will continue to provide an easy to access, 
available primary care options to help employees and their families 
obtain important preventive services such as annual exams and 
immunizations, lab tests, and help with early identification of costly, 
long-term chronic diseases before they progress.

Every employee in TTI EMEA’s Eastern European offices undergoes 
an obligatory medical check before starting his/her employment. In 
accordance with governing regulations, employees must participate 

84

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

in an Occupational Health & Safety training course. Employees  
are then required to pass an initial test. Within the first year of 
employment, employees are required to take a second Occupational 
Health and Safety training course and again, pass a test.

In U.A.E., TTI MEA’s employees adhere to the Jebel Ali Freezone 
Authority (“JAFZA”) rules & regulations. JAFZA performs annual 
office checks for local environmental, health and safety compliance.

Additionally, TTI MEA purchased new monitors for employees to 
improve eye protection and ergonomics.

Maintaining Exceptional People Through  
Training and Development
TTI is committed to providing comprehensive training programs, 
which collectively provide a uniform platform to all employees at  
all our locations, as well as an educational basis to enhance and 
improve employee skills. TTI is proud of its robust course,  
“Learn TTI”, which provides online training to new and existing 
employees on compliance and other subjects to strengthen both 
business and leadership skills. “Learn TTI” supports both various 
self-study vocational training and specific management courses for 
designated individuals. Our business units also strongly encourage 
internal and external training opportunities.

TTI Canada has worked hard over the past couple of years to  
partner with third-party training providers to customize training  
for employees. As a result, TTI Canada has developed a training 
manual for employees that showcases the offering for the Sales and 
Marketing Teams and Managers. Some of the course titles include, 
Building Customer Relationships, Time Management, Situational 
Leadership, Leadership Development, DiSC, Territory Engagement 
and Strategic Distributor Workshops and Management Essentials.

In 2014, TTI Canada launched a mentoring program to allow 
employees to spend one-on-one time with the leaders of the 
organization. Employees are paired up with a tenured individual  
who offers insight into specific career paths and areas of interest.  
TTI Canada also offers a “Job Shadowing” program whereby 
employees can work beside a colleague in a different role to 
experience first-hand what that role entails, allowing employees  
to make knowledgeable choices when developing their career plan  
at TTI Canada.

At TTI PE, succession planning is reviewed every year with areas  
and roles identified. Similarly, training and development needs are 
identified during the Annual Performance Review process, whereby 
employees and managers meet to discuss and lay out specific 
individual plans. Development and training initiatives also include 
collaboration with local technical and vocational schools. TTI PE also 
fosters continuing education, allowing employees to remain current  
in their field.

TTI is very active in recruiting college graduates to begin their career 
at TTI. Known as Team TTI, the group goes through a rigorous 
training program. All new employees are assigned a 90-day electronic 
learning plan that is completed via Learn TTI. Within the first 60 days 
of employment, all employees travel to the Pudwill Learning Center (PLC) 
to attend an intensive course in sales tactics, business management, 
and product knowledge. After six months of service, new employees 
return to the PLC to learn more about communication, problem 
solving and project management.

Like new employees, new managers at TTI PE attend management 
training within their first 90 days after promotion. This training covers 
a wide variety of topics, including leading a team, utilizing resources, 
understanding the business at a management level and recruiting.

At TTI, tracking the percentage of employees trained and the average 
training hours completed by gender and employee category is not 
mandatory. Some of our business units keep track of employees 
trained and training hours, while other business units are working 
toward implementing a system to tally those numbers. For example, 
in Hong Kong, 39% of men and 32% of women took additional 
non-mandatory training. By category, 33% of senior level males 
completed additional training, whereas 90% of senior level females 
completed additional training. Middle management male and female 
employees were nearly identical with 48% and 47% completing 
additional training. Male employees at TTI HK participated in 34%  
of additional training compared to only 9% of female counterparts.

33 %    

of senior level males

Likewise, in TTI Korea, 46% of men and 54% of women took 
additional training. 100% of the male middle management completed 
additional training, while 25% of female middle management did. 
Male employees at TTI Korea participated in 47% of additional 
training compared to 67% of female counterparts.

At TTI FC NA, over 3,000 hours of employee training were recorded 
and the average number of training hours spent by employee was 
6.09 in 2017.

Additionally, 100% of TTI Canada employees are trained based on 
their job category. In 2017, of the six senior management employees, 
all attended the Situational Leadership Course that involved  
24 training hours. Middle Management participated in 56 hours  
of training, while new employees received 144 hours of classroom 
training along with eLearning courses.

At the North America Milwaukee Tool locations, 2,100 employees 
were trained involving 23,089 hours of training. This included  
446 courses and totaled 16,390 attendees across all training events6.

At TTI Zhuhai, 100% of employees received training. On average, 
workers participated in four hours of training and staff received eight 
hours of training. For all locations in the PRC, 28% of females and 
72% of males completed additional training. Overall, the employees 
in the PRC completed 49,260 hours of training in 2017.

Of the more than 400 employees at DreBo, 28% participated in 
non-mandatory training. Of that 28%, 23 were female employees and 
95 male employees. The three senior management male employees 
averaged 61 hours of training. The one middle management female 
employee averaged 16 hours of training compared to 20 hours of the 
middle management male employees. At the employee level, male 
employees averaged 20 hours of training, whereas females averaged 
21 hours of training.

Respect for our Labor Force
TTI complies with all applicable international, national, state and local 
employment laws designed to protect the rights of all individuals and 
does not allow the use of child or forced labor in any of its facilities. 
TTI Handbooks outline company policies, as well as statutory laws 
and regulations that our organization requires to stay compliant.  
All TTI employees are mandated to take the “Learn TTI” course on 
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and our Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct as part of their onboarding. We also expect our 
suppliers and business partners to comply with our Business Partner 
Code of Conduct and our approach on this is outlined below.

In the United States, employees must complete a formal employee 
application for employment and must provide government-issued 
identification confirming that they are legally permitted to work. For 
workers under the age of 18, we follow local guidelines that limit 
number of hours allowed and hours of employment. Those hours 
must be approved by the employee’s parent or legal guardian.

In the PRC, we have additional mandated policies regarding child 
labor, juvenile workers and forced labor. Our PRC facilities never  
hire any person under the age of 16 and only hire juvenile workers 
between the ages of 16 and 18 during peak seasons. However,  
TTI requires our PRC locations to adhere to the Juvenile Worker 
Protection Policy and register the juvenile worker with the local  
Labor Bureau. In addition to following TTI policies, our PRC locations 
have instituted several preventative actions during hiring, including:

•  Human Resources checks identification cards (with date of  
birth information) of each candidate via a system linked with 
public security.

•  Upon hiring, Human Resources registers all juvenile workers’ 

names with the local labor bureau.

Sustainability in our Supply Chain
Globally, our focus is to assess and manage environmental and  
social risks across our supply chain. We engage and partner with  
TTI customers and suppliers to achieve this goal.

Our suppliers must comply with TTI’s policy against modern slavery 
and human trafficking based on the requirements of the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. 
TTI has also updated the Business Partners Code of Conduct to 
address these requirements. In 2017, we implemented changes and 
took additional steps in our selection and monitoring of our suppliers.

To assist with monitoring the compliance of our suppliers, TTI 
launched a new supply chain compliance platform in December 
2017. Enrolling our suppliers into the platform ensures TTI suppliers: 
(1) acknowledge TTI’s Policy Against Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking and Conflict Minerals Policy and TTI’s Business Partners 
Code of Conduct; and (2) complete surveys on supply chain 
transparency and modern slavery. Suppliers are also required to 
complete a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (“CMRT”).

Suppliers’ performance is monitored against our Business Partners 
Code of Conduct through regular internal and external audits. If 
non-performance issues or breaches are found, TTI will investigate. 
All non-compliances must be rectified through corrective action 
plans. Depending on the severity of the non-compliance, corrective 
action plans include training, additional factory audits and ongoing 
monitoring, or the business relationship is terminated.

It is TTI’s vision that through our continued effort in education, 
engagement and partnership, we can help our suppliers develop  
a shared culture that values corporate social responsibility. 
Implementing changes and taking additional steps will promote  
a sustainable supply chain in our industry.

Product Responsibility
Powerful brands and operational excellence are two of the 
cornerstones of TTI’s business model. The safety of our products, 
which are designed, manufactured, distributed or licensed by TTI  
is of the highest priority. Our business units:

• 

Comply with all applicable laws and regulations for the markets 
where such products are sold;

•  Meet or exceed all applicable voluntary industry standards; and

•  Meet reasonable consumer expectations for safety.

In an article published in December 2017 by ProPublica, TTI is 
lauded for keeping its promise to put a low-emissions generator on 
the market after years of discussion about the deadly risks of carbon 
monoxide emissions on the portable generator consumer. The 
Consumer Protection Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and the industry 
began discussions about implementing mandatory or voluntary 
standards in 2015. A year later, and still without any standards in 
place, TTI presented to the CPSC in 2016 an engine emitting 90% 
less carbon monoxide. In 2017, TTI launched its portable generator 
with the new engine into the market as the first company in the 
industry to do so. 

To better achieve global expectations, TTI hired a Global Product 
Safety Director in 2017 to direct the development, implementation 
and maintenance of a comprehensive product safety and consumer 
product regulatory compliance policy and system to ensure 
conformity and drive continual improvement of the safety and 
regulatory function globally. Within our business units, we have teams 
who are responsible for the safety, quality and regulatory compliance 
of our products. All products are tested for safety and quality to make 

sure they comply with all applicable requirements and that our 
customers are purchasing the safest and most innovative products  
on the market. Our internal legal departments manage the legal, 
regulatory and safety compliance of our products. Product recalls  
are referred to our legal teams, and together with the safety and 
regulatory departments, comply with regulations to manage the 
recalls until disposition.

TTI respects others’ intellectual property rights and all applicable laws 
and regulations regarding fair competition and advertising. TTI’s legal 
teams review packaging and products before production and launch 
to ensure such compliance.

In this age of cybersecurity attacks, TTI is especially diligent about 
the protection of our data, customers’ data, as well as our employees’ 
personal information. In 2015, TTI created the position of Group 
Senior Manager – Cybersecurity. The manager oversees heads  
of IT who monitor internal systems for each business unit globally.  
We also have a Cybersecurity Steering Committee comprised  
of the Group Senior Manager – Cybersecurity and members of  
senior management.

All systems in the company run anti-virus and anti-malware 
programs. We also have local firewall rules, file integrity scanning, 
and network level firewalls in place. We regularly send notices to  
all employees regarding attack and intrusion methods, such as  
email phishing and educate employees on things to be wary of and 
behaviors to avoid. For cloud-based services, we ensure that our 
agreements and practices are structured to protect TTI’s and its 
customer’s information.

Our Stance on Enforcing Anti-Corruption
TTI does not under any circumstances allow corruption or bribery  
in our interactions with others. We are committed to following all 
applicable anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws of the 
countries in which we operate. Additionally, we may not make or 
receive bribes to or from commercial business partners, such as 
vendors or other parties, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining 
business or otherwise securing an improper business advantage.

The prohibitions of these laws apply not only to actions taken by us 
as individuals; they also apply to actions taken by any outside parties 
doing business on our Company’s behalf. We have taken great steps 
internally to provide policies and procedures on how best to report 
and respond. In addition to Employee Handbooks, TTI has in place 
the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, the Complaint Resolution 
Policy and Procedure and the Business Partner Code of Conduct.  
All employees are required to complete the TTI Code of Ethics and 
Business Conduct Training upon their hiring. The TTI Corporate 
Complaint Resolution Policy and Procedures outlines the manner in 
which concerns or complaints may be filed, and the manner in which 
they will be handled, including confidentiality, no-retaliation, types of 
inquiries, record-keeping and information rights.

TTI has established an independent complaint hotline whereby any 
person may contact the third-party operator to make a complaint  
or report information confidentially and anonymously. Alternatively, 
employees may also contact TTI’s General Counsel. Complaints are 
then investigated by our internal audit team and corrective measures 
are taken accordingly.

At the end of 2017, TTI rolled out an online supplier compliance 
program through a company that delivers supply chain transparency 
services to support corporate sustainability, regulatory compliance 
and social responsibility initiatives. TTI suppliers receive an email 
invitation to login to the platform, to collaborate and verify compliance 
with TTI’s supply chain policies.

In addition to the policies and the online supplier compliance 
program, we mandate in PRC each employee and each vendor  
to execute a Declaration of Non-Conflict of Interest. Furthermore, 
during new hire orientation, employees receive face-to-face training 
on the Employee Handbook. TTI is also a member of the China 
Enterprise Anti-Fraud Alliance.

Similarly, in Hong Kong, our employees review a New Employee 
Induction presentation, which outlines our policy and procedure  
on soliciting, accepting and offering advantages.

At TTI Canada, we have the TTI Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
posters posted at each of our service centers and corporate office. 
We even commissioned a rendering of the “Our Core Values logo”  
to be installed at our corporate office as a reminder to employees.

Of the more than 35 countries where TTI is located, we have  
only had two concluded cases of corrupt practices against former 
employees in 2017. In one case, a former employee was sentenced 
to ten months in prison, while the other case is currently on appeal.

Investing in our Communities
TTI has a longstanding commitment to support the communities  
in which we live and work by providing resources, time and money  
to those charities where our efforts are best focused. Some of our 
business units have in place a formal committee, which is tasked  
with the selection of organizations that will allow its employees to give 
back to their communities and beyond. Other business units maintain 
sponsorship with the same charities year after year. However, those 
business units who sponsor community activities also evaluate new 
sponsorship opportunities through informal or formal means.

Throughout the year, TTI has partnered with more than 50 volunteer 
programs and charities worldwide, giving thousands of volunteer 
hours and hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Some of our 
business units allot a specific number of work hours or days for 
employees to volunteer at their favorite charity. Our employees 
choose a variety of organizations to support ranging from education, 
home building and child wellness to sports. Some of these activities 
are highlighted below.

The Next Generation

In Hong Kong, TTI donated US$52,500 to the Scholarship for  
Future Stars – Upward Mobility Scholarship. The scholarships are 
given to youth from less privileged backgrounds. The scholarships 
fund the youths’ education with the hope that through education, 
children will achieve upward social mobility.

Encouraging Science, Technology, Engineering and  
Mathematics (“STEM”)

STEM Forward – through volunteer efforts and financial donations, 
Milwaukee Tool supports STEM education and advancement in 
Wisconsin schools. Milwaukee Tool employees volunteer on robotics 
teams as mentors to high school students. Milwaukee Tool also 
sponsored “Girls in Stem Day” where time and tool contributions 
were both donated.

Building a Better Future

Our products serve as an avenue for giving those in our communities 
a place to call home. For years, TTI has been a proud sponsor of 
Habitat for Humanity. In the U.S., our employees volunteer their time 
to build homes in their communities and across their country. TTI 
continuously makes tool donations to Habitat for Humanity. Similarly, 
our Milwaukee brand tools and employee know-how assist with 
Operation Tiny Homes and Veterans Outreach of Wisconsin.

Children and Families

This year, the lower United States and Caribbean Islands were  
hit hard by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. TTI employees donated 
US$31,755 to the Red Cross and TTI promised to match employee 
donations and contribute an additional US$50,000. TTI exceeded  
its initial contributory promise and, together with the employee 
donations, contributed US$125,000 to assist children and families  
in the recovery efforts.

Support Through Activity

TTI Canada selects charity events that offer both a team-building 
opportunity for our employees and supports children’s sport activities, 
such as baseball and hockey through monetary donations. Before  
the Christmas holidays, TTI participates in a team-building charity 
volleyball tournament that raises funds for the Hospital for Sick Kids 
in Toronto. TTI Canada also participates in CN Tower Stair Climbs to 
help the World Wildlife Fund, which tackles major conservation issues 
to help safeguard the habitats of hundreds of species and continues 
to make ground-breaking progress towards habitat sustainability.

respectively.

Further discussion and analysis of these activities as required by

review of the business and a discussion of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group, particulars of important events 
affecting the Group that have occurred, and an indication of likely 
future development in the Group’s business, can be found in the 
“Chairman’s Statement”, “Chief Executive Officer’s Message”, 
“Review of Operations”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, 
“Corporate Governance Report”, “Environmental, Social and 
Governance Report” and “Financial Summary” sections of this 
Annual Report. The above sections form part of this report.

Results and Appropriations
The results of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2017 are 
set out in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other

An interim dividend of HK27.75 cents (approximately US3.57 cents) 
per share amounting to approximately US$65,507,000 was paid to 
the shareholders during the year.

Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group continued to expand its business and during the year 
spent approximately US$895,000 on leasehold land and buildings, 
acquired moulds and tooling for approximately US$15,795,000, 
office equipment, furniture and fixtures for approximately 
US$10,783,000 and plant and machinery for approximately

the year are set out in Note 16 to the consolidated financial

Details of movements during the year in the share capital of

A total of 1,500,000 ordinary shares (those bought back by  
the Company during 2016 at prices ranging from HK$27.50 to 
HK$28.15 per share) were settled and cancelled by the Company 
during 2017. The aggregate amount paid by the Company for such 
buy-backs cancelled during 2017 amounting to US$5,388,000 was 
charged to the retained earnings.

share capital of the Company was reduced. The buy-backs of  
the Company’s shares during the year were effected by the Directors 
pursuant to the mandate granted by shareholders at the previous 
annual general meeting of the Company, with a view to benefiting

Independent Auditor’s Report

TO THE MEMBERS OF TECHTRONIC INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED
創科實業有限公司
(incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techtronic Industries Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) set out on pages 108 to 186, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
December 31, 2017, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 
31, 2017, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong 
Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been 
properly prepared in compliance with the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“the Code”), and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter

How our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter

Impairment Assessment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with
Indefinite Useful Lives – Floor Care and Appliances Segment
We identified the impairment assessment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets for the Floor Care and Appliances segment as 
defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements as a key 
audit matter due to significant judgement and assumptions about 
the future performance of the segment.

As disclosed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, 
as at December 31, 2017 the carrying value of goodwill and 
trademarks attributable to the Floor Care and Appliances segment 
was US$143 million (2016: US$143 million). This segment is 
profitable but has underperformed in comparison to other cash 
generating units and management has made a number of key 
assumptions and assertions to support their assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to 
this segment. The key assumptions include growth rates, discount 
rates applied and the forecast performance based on 
management’s view of future business prospects. There is no 
impairment on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives for the Floor Care and Appliances segment for the year ended 
December 31, 2017.

Capitalization of Deferred Development Costs
We identified the capitalization of deferred development costs as a 
key audit matter due to significant management judgement about 
the future performance and viability of the products. The Group 
conducts a significant level of development activities and has to 
apply judgement in identifying projects meeting the criteria for 
capitalization under the requirements of accounting standards and 
to capture accurate time and cost information for those projects.

As disclosed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, 
as at December 31, 2017 the carrying value of deferred 
development costs was US$316 million (2016: US$297 million) 
and the additions during the year were US$109 million (2016: 
US$112 million).

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets for the Floor 
Care and Appliances segment included:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Assessing the valuation methodology adopted by 
management which is disclosed in Note 20 to the 
consolidated financial statements;

Challenging the reasonableness of key assumptions based 
on our knowledge of the business and industry;

Reconciling input data used in the cash flow forecasts to 
supporting evidence, such as approved budgets and 
considering the reasonableness of those budgets;

Considering the potential impact of reasonably possible 
downside changes in these key assumptions; and

Meeting with the independent valuation specialist engaged 
by management to understand the assumptions they used 
in building up the discounted cash flow model.

In performing our audit procedures, we engaged our internal 
valuation specialists to assess the discount rate applied by 
benchmarking against independent data.

Our procedures in relation to capitalization of deferred 
development costs included:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Testing management’s controls over capitalization of 
deferred development costs;

Evaluating the nature of the type of the research and 
development expenses incurred that are capitalized into 
intangible assets;

Assessing the reasonableness of the capitalization based 
on our knowledge of the business and industry; and

Evaluating the appropriateness of expenses capitalized, on 
a sample basis, by agreeing the material costs, overheads 
and engineers’ hours incurred to external invoices and 
internal timesheets and payroll records.

Independent Auditor’s Report

Key Audit Matters (continued)
Key Audit Matter

Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets
We identified the recoverability of deferred tax assets as a key audit 
matter due to the recognition of these assets involving judgement 
by management as to the likelihood of the realization of these 
deferred tax assets, which is based on a number of factors 
including whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future 
periods to support recognition.

As disclosed in Note 41 to the consolidated financial statements, 
as at December 31, 2017 the Group has recognized US$93 million 
(2016: US$178 million) of deferred tax assets in the consolidated 
statement of financial position.

How our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter

Our procedures in relation to management’s assessment about 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets included:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Evaluating management’s assessment on the sufficiency of 
future taxable profits in support of the recognition of 
deferred tax assets by comparing management’s forecasts 
of future profits to historical results and evaluating the 
assumptions used in those forecasts;

Discussing with the group tax director the tax positions of 
the loss making entities; and

Obtaining the communications between the Group and 
taxation authorities regarding tax positions.

Other Information
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance 
with section 405 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability 
to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

106

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by the directors.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether 
the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in the independent auditor’s report is Martin Stuart Hills.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended December 31, 2017

1.  General

The Company is a public limited company incorporated in Hong Kong and its shares are listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong 
Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). The address of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company is 29/F, Tower 2, 
Kowloon Commerce Centre, 51 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung, New Territories, Hong Kong.

The principal activities of the Group are the manufacturing and trading of electrical and electronic products.

The functional currency of the Company is United States dollars (“US$”).

2.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”)

Amendments to HKFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
The Group has applied the following amendments to HKFRSs issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(“HKICPA”) for the first time in the current year:

Amendments to HKAS 7
Amendments to HKAS 12
Amendments to HKFRS 12

Disclosure Initiative
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses
As part of the Annual Improvements to HKFRSs 2014 - 2016 Cycle

Except as described below, the application of the amendments to HKFRSs in the current year has had no material impact on the Group’s 
financial performance and positions for the current and prior years and/or on the disclosures set out in these consolidated financial 
statements.

Amendments to HKAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
The Group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures 
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-
cash changes. In addition, the amendments also require disclosures on changes in financial assets if cash flows from those financial 
assets were, or future cash flows will be, included in cash flows from financing activities.

Specifically, the amendments require the following to be disclosed: (i) changes from financing cash flows; (ii) changes arising from 
obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses; (iii) the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; (iv) changes in fair 
values; and (v) other changes.

A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of these items is provided in Note 49. Consistent with the transition provisions 
of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year. Apart from the additional disclosure in Note 
49, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

2.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

HKFRS 9 Financial Instruments
HKFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities, general hedge 
accounting and impairment requirements for financial assets.

The key requirements of HKFRS 9 which are relevant to the Group are:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of HKFRS 9 are required to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or 
fair value. Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash 
flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding are 
generally measured at amortized cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. Debt instruments that are held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and that have 
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding, are generally measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”). All 
other financial assets are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting periods. In addition, under HKFRS 9, 
entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held 
for trading) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss.

In relation to the impairment of financial assets, HKFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, as opposed to an incurred credit 
loss model under HKAS 39 Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement. The expected credit loss model requires an 
entity to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in 
credit risk since initial recognition. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses 
are recognized.

The new general hedge accounting requirements retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms currently available in 
HKAS 39. However, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specifically 
broadening the types of instruments that qualify for hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items 
that are eligible for hedge accounting. In addition, the retrospective quantitative effectiveness test has been removed. Enhanced 
disclosure requirements about an entity’s risk management activities have also been introduced.

Based on the Group’s financial instruments and risk management policies as at December 31, 2017, the directors of the Company 
anticipate the following potential impact on initial application of HKFRS 9:

Classification and Measurement:
(cid:116) 

Equity securities classified as available-for-sale investments carried at cost less impairment as disclosed in Note 22: these securities 
qualified for designation as measured at FVTOCI under HKFRS 9, however, the Group plans not to elect the option for designating 
these securities to be measured at FVTOCI and will measure these securities at fair value with subsequent fair value gains or losses 
to be recognized in profit or loss. Upon initial application of HKFRS 9, the directors of the Company do not anticipate that fair value 
changes related to these securities will have material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(cid:116) 

All other financial assets and financial liabilities will continue to be measured on the same bases as are currently measured under 
HKAS 39.

Impairment

In general, the directors of the Company anticipate that the application of the expected credit loss model of HKFRS 9 will result in earlier 
provision of credit losses which are not yet incurred in relation to the Group’s financial assets measured at amortized costs and other 
items that subject to the impairment provisions upon application of HKFRS 9 by the Group.

Based on the assessment by the directors of the Company, if the expected credit loss model were to be applied by the Group, the 
accumulated amount of impairment loss to be recognized by Group as at January 1, 2018 would be slightly increased as compared to the 
accumulated amount recognized under HKAS 39 mainly attributable to expected credit losses provision on trade receivables. Such further 
impairment recognized under expected credit loss model would reduce the opening retained profits at January 1, 2018.

Hedge Accounting
As the new hedge accounting requirements will align more closely with the Group’s risk management policies, with generally more 
qualifying hedging instruments and hedged items, an assessment of the Group’s current hedging relationships indicates that they will 
qualify as continuing hedging relationships upon application of HKFRS 9. Accordingly, the directors of the Company anticipate that the 
application of the new hedging requirements will not have a material impact on the Group’s current hedge designation and hedge 
accounting.

2.  Application of New and Revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) (continued)

HKFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
HKFRS 15 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts 
with customers. HKFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including HKAS 18 Revenue, HKAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and the related interpretations when it becomes effective.

The core principle of HKFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

Under HKFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or 
services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. Far more prescriptive guidance has been added 
in HKFRS 15 to deal with specific scenarios. Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by HKFRS 15.

In 2016, the HKICPA issued Clarifications to HKFRS 15 in relation to the identification of performance obligations, principal versus agent 
considerations, as well as licensing application guidance.

The directors of the Company anticipate that the application of HKFRS 15 in the future may result in more disclosures, however, the 
directors of the Company do not anticipate that the application of HKFRS 15 will have a material impact on the timing and amounts of 
revenue recognized in the respective reporting periods.

HKFRS 16 Leases
HKFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and 
lessees. HKFRS 16 will supersede HKAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective.

HKFRS 16 distinguishes lease and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Distinctions of 
operating leases and finance leases are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding liability have to be recognized for all leases by lessees, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease 
payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. For the classification of cash flows, the Group currently presents 
upfront prepaid lease payments as investing cash flows in relation to leasehold land for owned use and those classified as investment 
properties while other operating lease payments are presented as operating cash flows. Under HKFRS 16, lease payments in relation to a 
lease liability will be allocated into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing cash flows by the Group.

Under HKAS 17, the Group has already recognized an asset and a related finance lease liability, for a finance lease arrangement and 
prepaid lease payments for leasehold land where the Group is a lessee. The application of HKFRS 16 may result in potential changes in 
classification of these assets depending on whether the Group presents right-of-use assets separately or within the same line item at 
which the corresponding underlying assets would be presented if they were owned.

Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by HKFRS 16.

As at December 31, 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of US$317,271,000 as disclosed in Note 43. A 
preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements may meet the definition of a lease. Upon application of HKFRS 16, the Group 
will recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term 
leases. In addition, the application of new requirements may result in changes in measurement, presentation and disclosure as indicated 
above.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended December 31, 2017

3.  Significant Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. In addition, the 
consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock 
Exchange (the “Listing Rules”) and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (“CO”).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are 
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if 
market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value 
for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-
based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of 
HKAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realizable value in HKAS 2 
Inventories or value in use in HKAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
which are described as follows:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly; and

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

has the power over the investee;

is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to 
control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each item of other comprehensive income are attributed to the Owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the Owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Business Combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities 
incurred by the Group to the former Owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except that:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in 
accordance with HKAS 12 Income Taxes and HKAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;

liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance 
with HKFRS 2 at the acquisition date (see the accounting policy below); and

assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with HKFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after re-assessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in 
the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction 
basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another 
standard.

Where the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and considered as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with the corresponding adjustments made against goodwill. Measurement 
period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot 
exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is 
classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with HKAS 39, or HKAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less any 
accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (or groups of cash generating 
units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes and not larger than an operating segment.

A cash generating unit (or groups of cash generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or 
more frequently whenever there is indication that the unit may be impaired. For goodwill arising on an acquisition in a reporting period, 
the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment before the end of that reporting period.

If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash generating unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (or groups of cash generating units). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized 
directly in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not 
reversed in subsequent periods.

On disposal of the relevant cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the amount of 
profit or loss on disposal (or any of the cash-generating unit within group of cash-generating units in which the Group monitors goodwill).

Interests in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates. 
Changes in net assets of the associate/joint venture other than profit or loss and other comprehensive income are not accounted for 
unless such changes resulted in changes in ownership interest held by the Group. When the Group’s share of loss of an associate 
exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the 
extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of that associate.

An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the invested becomes an associate. On 
acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the invested is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after 
reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

The requirements of HKAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss with respect to the 
Group’s investment in an associate. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for 
impairment in accordance with HKAS 36 as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any 
reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in accordance with HKAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment 
subsequently increases.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in the 
investee with a resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate and the 
retained interest is a financial asset within the scope of HKAS 39, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and 
the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the 
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing the relevant interest in the 
associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or 
loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) upon disposal/partial disposal of the relevant associate.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Interests in Associates (continued)
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies 
to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group (such as a sale or contribution of assets), profits and losses resulting from 
the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associate that are not related to the Group.

Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets Acquired Separately

Intangible assets acquired separately and with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately 
are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses (see the accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on 
tangible and intangible assets below).

An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured at the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognized.

Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially measured at their fair value 
at the acquisition date. The cost of these intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is provided on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. 

Alternatively, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses (see the 
accounting policy in respect of impairment losses on tangible and intangible assets below).

Internally-generated Intangible Assets - Research and Development Expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development activities (or from the development phase of an internal project) is 
recognized only if all of the following have been demonstrated:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and

the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The amount initially recognized for an internally-generated intangible asset is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the 
intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized, development 
expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, an internally-generated intangible asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses (if any), on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

For the year ended December 31, 2017

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

The Group as Lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognized as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidation statement of 
financial position as a finance lease obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs (see the 
accounting policy below).

Operating lease payments, including the cost of acquiring land held under operating leases, are recognized as an expense on a straight-
line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, these incentives are recognized as a liability. The aggregate 
benefits of incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Leasehold Land and Building
When the Group makes payments for a property interest which includes both leasehold land and building elements, the Group assesses 
the classification of each element separately based on the assessment as to whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of each element have been transferred to the Group, unless it is clear that both elements are operating leases in which case 
the entire property is accounted as an operating lease. Specifically, the entire consideration (including any lump-sum upfront payments) 
are allocated between the leasehold land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values of the leasehold interests in the 
land element and building element at initial recognition.

To the extent the allocation of the lease payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold land that is accounted for as an operating 
lease is presented as “lease prepayments” in the consolidated statement of financial position and is amortized over the lease term on a 
straight-line basis. When the lease payments cannot be allocated reliably between the leasehold land and building elements, the entire 
property is generally classified as if the leasehold land is under finance lease and accounted for as property, plant and equipment, unless 
it is clear that both elements are operating leases, in which case the entire lease is classified as an operating lease.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment including buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative 
purposes, other than construction in progress, are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and construction in 
progress, over their estimated useful lives and after taking into account of their estimated residual values, using the straight-line method. 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any 
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Construction in progress includes property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production or for its own use purposes. 
Construction in progress is carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees capitalized in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy. Construction in progress is classified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment 
when completed and ready for its intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment, 
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

122

Techtronic Industries Annual Report 2017

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment (continued)
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the 
term of the relevant lease. However, when there is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be obtained by the end of the lease term, 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognized.

Impairment Losses on Tangible and Intangible Assets other than Goodwill (see the Accounting Policy in 
respect of Goodwill above)
At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and 
consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they 
are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset (or a cash-generating unit) for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or a cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. In allocating the impairment loss, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if applicable) and then to the other assets on a pro-rata basis based on the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. The carrying amount of an asset is not reduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of 
disposal (if measureable), its value in use (if determinable) and zero. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been 
allocated to the asset is allocated pro-rata to the other assets of the unit. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash generating unit is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or a cash generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognized as income immediately.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when a group entity becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are 
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized 
immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets are classified into one of the three categories, including financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(“FVTPL”), loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the 
financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized 
and derecognized on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

Financial Assets (continued)
Effective Interest Method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees paid or 
received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected 
life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Interest income is recognized on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL, of 
which interest income is included in net gains or losses.

Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading.

A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; or

it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of 
short-term profit-taking; or

it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value arising from remeasurement recognized directly in profit 
or loss in the period in which they arise. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the 
financial assets.

Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables, bills receivable, trade receivables from an 
associate and bank balances, deposits and cash) are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any identified 
impairment losses (see accounting policy in respect of impairment of financial assets below).

Available-for-sale Financial Assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated or not classified as financial assets at FVTPL, loans and 
receivables or held-to-maturity investments.

For available-for-sale equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be 
reliably measured, they are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period (see accounting 
policy in respect of impairment of financial assets below).

Financial Assets (continued)
Impairment of Financial Assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of 
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have been affected.

For all other financial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or

breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or

it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organization.

For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables and trade receivables from an associate, assets that are assessed not to 
be impaired individually are, in addition, subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for 
a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed 
payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 30 to 120 days, or observable changes in national or local economic conditions 
that correlate with default on receivables.

For financial assets carried at amortized cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognized is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

For financial assets carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such 
impairment loss will not be reversed in subsequent periods.

The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables and trade receivables from an associate, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognized in profit or loss. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to profit 
or loss.

For financial assets measured at amortized cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed 
what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been recognized.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Liabilities and Equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by a group entity are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity Instrument
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Buy-back of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.

Effective Interest Method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points 
paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Interest expense is recognized on an effective interest basis.

Other Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost
Other financial liabilities (including unsecured borrowings, trade and other payables, bills payable, discounted bills with recourse and 
bank overdrafts) are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date when a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship.

Hedge Accounting

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions for foreign currency exposure (cash flow 
hedges).

At the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized 
immediately in profit or loss.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (hedging reserve) are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as the recognized hedged item.

Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Guarantee Contracts

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. A 
financial guarantee contract issued by the Group and not designated as at fair value through profit or loss is recognized initially at its fair 
value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial guarantee contract. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
the Group measures the financial guarantee contract at the higher of: (i) the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accordance with HKAS 37; and (ii) the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization recognized over the 
guarantee period in accordance with the revenue recognition policy.

Derecognition

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group continues to 
recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement and recognizes an associated liability. If the Group retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also 
recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity is recognized in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are derecognized only when the obligation specified in the relevant contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. The 
difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.

Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

A provision for warranties is recognized at the time the products are sold based on the estimated cost using historical data for the level of 
repairs and replacements.

For a provision in relation to employee termination benefits, the liability and expenses are recognized when the Group committed to 
terminate the employment of an employee or group of employees before their normal retirement date or provide termination benefits as a 
result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of inventories is calculated using the first-in, first-out method. Net 
realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make 
the sales.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods sold by the 
Group to outside customers in the normal course of business, less returns and allowances, and commission income and royalty income 
received.

Revenue is recognized when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow 
to the Group and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below.

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized when goods are delivered and title has passed.

Commission income is recognized when services are provided.

Royalty income is recognized on a time proportion basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.

Dividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive payment have been established.

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred assets and 
liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In 
addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and 
interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits 
of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or 
the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in 
the accounting for the business combination.

Foreign Currencies
In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that 
entity (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting 
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates at that date. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognized in profit or 
loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences arising on a monetary item that form part of the Company’s net 
investment in a foreign operation, in which case, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity and will be reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period, 
and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of translation reserve (attributed to non-
controlling interests as appropriate).

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of 
control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that 
includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners 
of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in the Group 
losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are reattributed to non-controlling 
interests and are not recognized in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates that do not result in the 
Group losing significant influence), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after January 1, 
2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the 
reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognized in the translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on acquisitions of foreign operations before January 1, 2005 
are treated as non-monetary foreign currency items of the acquirer and reported using the historical exchange rate prevailing at the date 
of the acquisition.

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings 
pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.

All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Equity-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions
The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments determined at the grant date without taking into consideration all non-market 
vesting conditions is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve). At the end of each reporting 
period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest based on assessment of all relevant non-
market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

At the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognized in employee share-based compensation reserve will 
be transferred to share capital (share premium before March 3, 2014). When the share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at 
the expiry date, the amount previously recognized in the employee share-based compensation reserve will be transferred to retained 
profits.

The fair value of services received determined by reference to the fair value of shares awarded at the grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity (employee share-based compensation reserve).

When the trustee purchases the Company’s shares from the open market, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is presented as shares held for share award scheme and deducted from total equity. No gain or loss is recognized on 
the transactions of the Company’s own shares.

When the trustee transfers the Company’s shares to grantees upon vesting, the related costs of the granted shares vested are reversed 
from shares held under the share award scheme. Accordingly, the related expense of the granted shares vested is reversed from the 
employee share-based compensation reserve. The difference arising from this transfer is debited/credited to retained profits. At the end of 
the reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that are expected to ultimately vest. The impact of the revision 
of the estimate, if any, is recognized in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the employee share-based compensation reserve.

Government Grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to 
them and that the grants will be received. Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in 
which the Group recognized as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Retirement Benefit Schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme are charged as expenses when 
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

For defined benefit retirement benefits plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in 
the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in reserves and will not be reclassified to 
profit or loss.

Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);

net interest expense or income; and

remeasurement.

3.  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Retirement Benefit Schemes (continued)
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in the line item administrative expenses under profit or loss. 
Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan 
amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or 
asset.

The retirement benefit obligations recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in 
the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Short-term and other Long-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid as and when employees 
rendered the services. All short-term employee benefits are recognized as an expense unless another HKFRS requires or permits the 
inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset.

A liability is recognized for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave) after deducting any 
amount already paid.

Liabilities recognized in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Any changes in the 
liabilities’ carrying amounts resulting from service costs, interests and remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent 
that another HKFRS requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset.

4.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors are required to make estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
period in which the estimates are revised if the revisions affect only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the 
revisions affect both current and future periods.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year.

Estimated Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired requires an estimation of their recoverable 
amounts, which is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal of the cash generating units to which goodwill and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. As at 
December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are approximately US$555,350,000 
(2016: US$553,194,000) and approximately US$219,440,000 (2016: US$219,440,000) respectively. Details of the recoverable amount 
calculation are disclosed in Note 20. In determining whether the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired, 
the management takes into consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the cash generating units. When 
the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material loss may arise. Management is confident that the carrying 
amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and adjustments will be made in future periods if 
future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

For the year ended December 31, 2017

4.  Key Sources of Accounting Estimates (continued)

Capitalization, Useful Lives and Estimated Impairment of Deferred Development Costs
Determining the development costs, including the time and costs for individual projects, to be capitalized requires estimations and 
assumptions based on the expected future economic benefits to be generated by the products resulting from these development costs. 
Other important estimations and assumptions in this assessment process are the feasibility of mass production, the distinction between 
research and development and the estimated useful life. As at December 31, 2017, the carrying amounts of deferred development costs 
of the Group are US$316,312,000 (2016: US$297,261,000). The estimation of their useful lives impacts the level of annual amortization 
recorded. The estimation of their useful lives reflects the directors’ best estimate of the periods that future economic benefits will be 
received through the use of the assets. In determining whether the deferred development costs are impaired, the management takes into 
consideration the anticipated revenues and estimated future cash flows from the underlying projects, and the progress of these projects. 
When the actual revenues and future cash flows are less than expected, a material loss may arise. Management is confident that the 
carrying amount of the assets will be recovered in full. This situation will be closely monitored and adjustments will be made in future 
periods if future market activity indicates that adjustments are required.

Useful Lives and Impairment Assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and identified impairment losses. As at December 31, 
2017, the Group’s carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is US$688,868,000 (2016: US$601,230,000). The estimation of 
their useful lives impacts the level of annual depreciation expense recorded. The estimated useful life that the Group places the 
equipment into production reflects the directors’ estimate of the periods that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from 
the use of the Group’s property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific 
asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable. This process requires management’s estimate of future cash flows generated by 
each asset or group of assets. For any instance where this evaluation process indicates impairment, the appropriate assets’ carrying 
values are written down to their recoverable amount and the amount of the write-down is charged against the results of operations.

Income Taxes
As at December 31, 2017, a deferred tax asset of approximately US$46,523,000 (2016: US$89,952,000) in relation to unused tax losses 
and approximately US$24,196,000 (2016: US$48,199,000) in relation to employee related provisions has been recognized in the Group’s 
consolidated statement of financial position. The realizability of the deferred tax asset mainly depends on whether sufficient taxable profits, 
or taxable temporary differences, will be available in the future. In cases where the actual future taxable profits generated are less than 
expected, a material reversal of the deferred tax asset may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which the 
reversal takes place. During the year, deferred tax assets of approximately US$15,116,000 (2016: US$9,200,000) in relation to unused 
tax losses were utilized.

Estimated Impairment of Trade and Other Receivables, Bills Receivable and Trade Receivables from an 
Associate
When there is objective evidence of an impairment loss, the Group takes into consideration the estimation of future cash flows. The 
amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition, where applicable). When the actual future cash flows are less than 
expected, a material impairment loss may arise. As at December 31, 2017, the Group’s carrying amount of trade and other receivables, 
bills receivable and trade receivables from an associate is US$1,150,454,000 (net of allowance for doubtful debts of US$37,114,000) 
(2016: US$969,279,000 (net of allowance for doubtful debts of US$20,025,000)).

Hong Kong Profits Tax is calculated at 16.5% of the estimated assessable profit for both years.

Taxation arising in other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.

Overprovision of income tax in prior years includes reversal of provisions for estimated tax expenses in respect of successfully completed 
tax audits, primarily in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).

The substantial deferred tax expense associated with the change in marginal United States (“US”) Federal tax rates from 35% to 21% has 
triggered a substantial writedown of existing US net deferred tax assets amounted to US$59,552,000 which is primarily comprised of tax 
loss carryforwards.

The tax charge for the year is reconciled as follows:

Profit before taxation

Tax at Hong Kong Profits Tax rate
Effect of different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in 
  other jurisdictions
Tax effect of expenses not deductible for tax purposes
Tax effect of income not taxable for tax purposes
Utilization of deductible temporary differences previously 
  not recognized
Tax effect of tax losses and deductible temporary
  differences not recognized
Deferred tax asset impairment
Over provision in respect of prior years
Tax effect of changes in tax rates

The retailer and service relationships were acquired through business combinations which related to the relationships with retailers and 
service centers.

Deferred development costs are internally generated by capitalizing the costs pertaining to development of new or enhancement of 
existing products.

Included in trademarks of the Group, US$219,440,000 (2016: US$219,440,000) are trademarks as considered by the management of 
the Group as having indefinite useful lives because they are expected to contribute to the Group’s net cash inflows indefinitely. The 
trademarks will not be amortized until their useful lives are determined to be finite. Instead they will be tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Particulars of the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 20.

The above intangible assets, other than trademarks with indefinite useful lives, are amortized on a straight-line basis, at the following rates 
per annum:

Deferred development costs
Patents
Trademarks with finite useful lives
Retailer and service relationships
Non compete agreement

20% - 331/3%

20. Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives

As explained in Note 5, the Group uses the types of goods sold for operating segment information. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives set out in Notes 18 and 19, the majority of the amounts have been allocated to five 
major individual cash generating units (CGUs), including four units in the Power Equipment segment and one unit in the Floor Care and 
Appliances segment. The carrying amounts of goodwill and trademarks as at December 31, 2017 allocated to these units are as follows:

Power Equipment – MET
Power Equipment – HCP
Power Equipment – Drebo
Power Equipment – Baja
Floor Care and Appliances – RAM/Hoover/VAX

No impairment of goodwill and trademarks have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The basis of the recoverable amounts of the above CGUs and their major underlying assumptions are summarized below:

Power Equipment - MET (“MET”)
The recoverable amount of MET’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation 
uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period and a discount rate of 10.0% 
(2016: 10.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for MET are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including sales, 
gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on MET’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success in new products launched, the success in reducing 
the working capital requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategy implemented by the Group. Cash flow projections beyond 
the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 3.0% (2016: 3.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible 
change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of MET’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the recoverable 
amounts.

Power Equipment – HCP (“HCP”)
The recoverable amount of HCP’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation 
uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 11.0% 
(2016: 11.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for HCP are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including sales, 
gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on HCP’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success in new products launched and the success of the cost 
cutting strategy implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated without considering any growth rate. 
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of HCP’s 
goodwill and intangibles to exceed the aggregate recoverable amounts.

20. Impairment Testing on Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives (continued)

Power Equipment – Drebo (“Drebo”)
The recoverable amount of Drebo’s goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 11.0% (2016: 11.0%) 
per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Drebo are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including sales, 
gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Drebo’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success in new products launched and the cost cutting 
strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a 1.0% (2016: 1.0%) growth rate. 
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Drebo’s 
goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

Power Equipment – Baja (“Baja”)
The recoverable amount of Baja’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation 
uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate of 12.0% 
(2016: 12.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for Baja are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows including sales, 
gross margin, operating expenses and working capital requirements. The assumptions and estimations are based on Baja’s past 
performance, management’s expectations of the market development and the success of the cost cutting strategy implemented. Cash flow 
projections beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any 
reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Baja’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed 
the aggregate recoverable amounts.

Floor Care and Appliances – RAM/Hoover/VAX (“RAM/Hoover/VAX”)
The recoverable amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and a discount rate 
of 14.0% (2016: 15.0%) per annum.

Cash flow projections during the budget period for RAM/Hoover/VAX are based on management’s estimation of cash inflows/outflows 
including sales, gross margin, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The assumptions and 
estimations are based on RAM/Hoover/VAX’s past performance, management’s expectations of the market development, the success in 
reducing the working capital requirements and the success of the cost cutting strategies implemented. Cash flow projections beyond the 
5-year period are extrapolated using a steady 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) growth rate. Management believes that any reasonably possible change 
in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of RAM/Hoover/VAX’s goodwill and intangibles to exceed the aggregate 
recoverable amounts.

Particulars of the associates as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are set out in Note 52.

The amounts due from associates are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are repayable on demand.

At the end of the reporting period, amongst the associates, the Group held 40.8% of the shares of Gimelli International (Holdings) Limited 
and its subsidiaries (together the “Gimelli Group companies”). The Group has discontinued recognizing its share of the losses of the 
Gimelli Group companies. The unrecognized share of profit (loss) for the year and cumulatively, extracted from the relevant management 
accounts of the associates, are US$424,000 (2016: US$557,000) and (US$3,955,000) (2016: (US$4,379,000)) respectively.

As at December 31, 2017, all available-for-sale investments represent investments in unlisted equity securities and club membership 
debentures. They are measured at cost less impairment at the reporting date because the range of reasonable fair value estimates is so 
significant that the directors of the Company are of the opinion that their fair values cannot be measured reliably.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an internal credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and 
defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed regularly. Trade receivables that are neither past 
due nor impaired have the best credit scoring attributable under the internal credit scoring system used by the Group.

Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of US$159,086,000 (2016: US$112,148,000) which 
are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for impairment loss. The Group does not hold any collateral over 
these balances. The average age of these receivables is 59 days (2016: 42 days).

The Group has a policy of allowing credit periods ranging mainly from 30 days to 120 days. Trade receivables that were past due but not 
provided for impairment loss are related to a number of independent customers that have a good track record with the Group. The 
management believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of these balances as there has not been a significant change 
in credit quality of the relevant customers and the balances are still considered fully recoverable.

In accordance with receivables purchase agreements, certain trade receivables were factored to banks (the “Factored Trade 
Receivables”). As the Group still retained the risks associated in respect of default payments, the Group has continued to recognize the 
Factored Trade Receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position. At the end of the reporting period, proceeds from the 
Factored Trade Receivables of approximately US$75,000,000 (2016: US$75,000,000) were recognized as liabilities and included in 
“Unsecured borrowings – due within one year” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

25. Bills Receivable

All the Group’s bills receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are due within 120 days.

26. Trade Receivables from an Associate

The trade receivables from an associate were aged and are due within 120 days.

Acquisition Right of Certain Property, Plant and Equipment
As at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Group owned a right to acquire certain property, plant and equipment which was acquired as 
part of the acquisition of the Oreck business from the Oreck Bankruptcy Estate. The right is expected to be exercised in 2032. The fair 
value of the property, plant and equipment was US$9,558,000 valued on September 30, 2017 (2016: US$9,986,000 valued on 
September 30, 2016) by Duff & Phelps, LLC., an independent valuer not related to the Group.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts under Hedge Accounting
At the end of the reporting period, the Group had the following foreign currency forward contracts designated as highly effective hedging 
instruments in order to manage the Group’s foreign currency exposure in relation to future foreign currency sales. The terms of the foreign 
exchange contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the respective designated hedged items.

33. Obligations under Finance Leases

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its land and buildings, plant and machinery and fixtures and equipment under finance leases, 
with lease terms ranging from 2.5 years to 20 years. Interest rates underlying all obligations under finance leases are fixed at the 
respective contract dates ranging from 5.06% to 8.98% (December 31, 2016: 0.53% to 7.50%) per annum. No arrangements have been 
entered into that include contingent rental payments.

The maturity of obligations under finance leases is as follows:

Amounts payable under finance leases:

34. Discounted Bills with Recourse

Bills discounted with banks at an effective interest rate of 2.06% per annum (2016: 1.80% per annum) have maturity profiles of less than 
120 days.

35. Capital Risk Management

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return 
to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from prior years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt (which includes borrowings, discounted bills with recourse and obligations under 
finance leases), net of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to Owners of the Company, comprising issued share capital, 
reserves and retained profits.

Gearing Ratio
The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the management considers the cost 
of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a target gearing ratio of not exceeding 35% determined as the 
proportion of net debt to equity. The Group will continue to execute very disciplined control and management of its working capital and 
generate free cash inflows through the growth of the business.

The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows:

Bank balances, deposits and cash

(ii) 

Equity includes all capital and reserves attributable to the Owners of the Company.

In addition, based on management recommendations, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of 
dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

36.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group’s corporate treasury function provides risk management advice to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic 
and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through 
internal risk reports which analyze exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These financial risks include market risk (including 
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group seeks to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments or natural hedges to mitigate these 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies is reviewed by the internal auditors on a 
continuous basis. The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

36.2.1  Foreign Currency Risk Management

Subsidiaries of the Group have foreign currency sales and purchases, which expose the Group to foreign currency risk. 
Approximately 22.1% (2016: 21.1%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the group entity making the sale, whilst almost 48.5% (2016: 52.5%) of purchases are denominated in the group entity’s 
respective functional currency.

The carrying amounts of certain significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Liabilities

Assets

2017
US$’000

2016
US$’000

2017

2016
US$’000

Foreign Currency
EURO

131,797

98,830

212,455

159,456

Note:  For group entities with their functional currency as the US$, monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars have no 

material foreign currency risk exposure as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged with the US$.

The Group requires its group entities to use foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the currency exposure. The foreign 
exchange forward contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. On this basis, the Group has entered into 
forward contracts in relation to the foreign currency amounting to US$721,579,000 (2016: US$157,799,000). It is the 
Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximize hedge 
effectiveness (see Note 27 for details).

36.2.1  Foreign Currency Risk Management (continued)

Sensitivity Analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the effects of rate fluctuations in the EURO against US$.

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US$ against the EURO without 
considering the foreign currency forward contracts entered at end of the reporting period. 5% is the sensitivity rate used 
when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of 
the reasonably possible change in the EURO:US$ foreign exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis includes outstanding foreign 
currency denominated monetary items and excludes the effect of any foreign currency forward contracts held at the reporting 
date. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit for the year where the US$ weakens 5% against the EURO.

2017

2,816

(i) 

This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on receivables, payables and bank borrowings denominated in EURO at the reporting 

date.

36.2.2  Interest Rate Risk Management

The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk management section of 
this note. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate borrowing (see Note 37 for details of 
these borrowings), discounted bills with recourse, bank balances and deposits. The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk is 
mainly concentrated on London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) arising from the Group’s US$ and EURO denominated 
borrowings. In relation to interest bearing bank balances and deposits, the Group considers the interest rate risk is 
insignificant. The management continuously monitors interest rate fluctuations and will consider further hedging interest rate 
risk should the need arise.

The Group is also exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to fixed-rate bank borrowings (see Note 37 for details of 
these borrowings).

During the year, the Group obtained new bank borrowings of US$2,206 million (2016: US$1,669 million) which are either at 
fixed rate or LIBOR based. The proceeds were used to repay the Group’s borrowings.

36.2  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (continued)

36.2.2  Interest Rate Risk Management (continued)

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments. 
The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding 
for the whole year without considering the interest rate swaps entered at the end of the reporting period. A 50 basis point 
increase or decrease in LIBOR is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s post-tax profit 
for the year ended December 31, 2017 would decrease/increase by US$3,761,000 (2016: decrease/increase by 
US$4,598,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable-rate borrowings.

The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the decrease in variable rate 
debt instruments respectively.

36.2.3  Other Price Risk

The Group is exposed to price risk through its held-for-trading investments and derivative financial instruments.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to price risks of equity investments held-for-
trading measured at fair value at the reporting date.

If the prices of the respective equity instruments had been 10% higher the profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 of 
the Group would increase by US$3,229,000 (2016: N/A) as a result of the changes in fair value of held-for-trading 
investments.

36.2.4  Credit Risk Management

As at December 31, 2017, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to 
failure to discharge an obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees provided by the Group is arising from:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the carrying amount of the respective recognized financial assets as stated in the statements of financial position; and

the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to financial guarantees issued by the Group as disclosed in Note 44.

In order to minimize the credit risk, the management has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits, 
credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In 
addition, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt and debt investments at each reporting 
date to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the directors of the 
Company consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced.

The credit risk on liquid funds is limited for the Group because the counterparties are banks with good reputations and credit 
ratings.

The Group’s concentration of credit risk by geographical location is mainly in North America, where 69.4% (2016: 65.9%) of 
the total trade receivables as at December 31, 2017 are located.

The Group has concentration of credit risk as 36.7% (2016: 28.0%) and 48.3% (2016: 39.2%) of the total trade receivables 
were due from the Group’s largest customer and the five largest customers respectively.

36.2.5  Liquidity Risk Management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities.

As at December 31, 2017, the Group has available unutilized overdrafts facilities and short and medium term bank loan 
facilities of approximately US$274 million (2016: US$256 million) and US$1,694 million (2016: US$1,559 million) 
respectively.

Liquidity Tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities as well as 
non-derivative financial assets which are included in the maturity analysis. For non-derivative financial assets, the tables have 
been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the undiscounted cash flow of the financial assets unless specified 
separately. For non-derivative financial liabilities, the tables reflect the undiscounted cash flow of financial liabilities based on 
the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the 
extent that the interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from the interest rate curve at the end of 
the reporting period. The inclusion of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the 
Group’s liquidity risk management as the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.

In addition, the following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual net cash inflows and (outflows) on derivative instruments that settle 
on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross inflows and (outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When 
the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the foreign currency exchange 
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The liquidity analysis for the Group’s derivative financial instruments are 
prepared based on the contractual maturities as the management considers that the contractual maturities are essential for 
an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.

Note:  Maturities are based on the management’s estimation of the expected realization of these financial assets.

The amounts included above for financial guarantee contracts are the maximum amounts the Group could be required to 
settle under the arrangement for the full guaranteed amount if that amount is claimed by the counterparty to the guarantee. 
Based on expectations at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that no amount 
will be payable under the arrangement. However, this estimate is subject to change depending on the probability of the 
counterparty claiming under guarantee which is a function of the likelihood that the financial receivables held by the 
counterparty which are guaranteed suffer credit losses.

The amount included above for variable interest rate instruments for non-derivative financial liabilities is subject to change if 
changes in variable interest rates differ to those estimates of interest rate determined at the end of the reporting period.

36.3  Fair Value

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contract;

the fair value of financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with 
reference to quoted market bid prices; and

the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions.

Fair Value Measurements Recognized in the Statement of Financial Position
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured on a recurring basis.

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The 
following table gives information about how the fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined (in 
particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used), as well as the level of the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value 
measurements are categorized (Levels 1 to 3) based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are 
observable.

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

(cid:116) 

Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;

Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following were the Group’s financial assets as at December 31, 2017 that were transferred to banks by discounting or factoring 
those trade and bills receivables on a full recourse basis. As the Group has not transferred all of the significant risks and rewards 
relating to these receivables, it continues to recognize the full carrying amount of the receivables and has recognized the cash 
received on the transfer as discounted bills with recourse (see Note 34) and unsecured borrowings - due within one year (see Note 
37). These financial assets are carried at amortized cost in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position.

The trade and bills receivables discounted with banks with full recourse at the year end was as follows:

40. Retirement Benefit Obligations

Defined Contribution Plans:
The Company and its subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong have participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (“MPF 
Schemes”) registered under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance since December 2000. The assets of the MPF Schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group, in funds under the control of trustees. The Group contributes 5% of relevant payroll cost to 
the MPF Schemes with a maximum amount of HK$18,000 (2016: HK$18,000) per employee per annum, which contribution is matched 
by the employee.

The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the PRC are members of a state-managed retirement benefit scheme operated by the PRC 
government. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund 
the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.

The Group’s overseas subsidiaries operate a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes 
applicable to each year are made at a certain percentage of the employees’ payroll.

The total expense recognized in profit or loss of US$10,474,000 (2016: US$9,348,000) represents contributions payable to these plans 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Defined Benefits Plans:
The Group operates several defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Germany and the US, of which these plans 
cover substantially all remaining employees that are not covered by defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plan is administered 
by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number of 
representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its articles of 
association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, employers. The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The major 
defined benefit plans are as follows:

Pension plan obligations (Note i)
Post-retirement, medical and dental plan obligations (Note ii)
Life and medical insurance plan (Note ii)
Post-employment benefit plan obligations (Note iii)
Others

The pension plan obligations are provided in the German operations and includes a plan that pays retirement benefits on service and final pay. In general, 

the benefit plans were closed to new members at the end of 1995. Under the plan, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 10% 

and 20% of final salary (based on the average of the last three years) on attainment of a retirement age of 65. The most recent actuarial valuations of the 

present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out on January 1, 2018, by BDO AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, Germany.

Note ii: 

Post-retirement, medical and dental plan obligations/Life and medical insurance plan

Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the US, operates unfunded post-retirement, medical benefits, dental and life insurance 

plans. The most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of the obligations were carried out on January 5, 2018 by Willis Towers Watsons.

Note iii: 

Post-employment benefit plan obligations

The pension plan obligations are provided by Hoover Inc. for members of IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) Local 1985 employed by 

Hoover. The most recent actuarial valuation of the present value of the obligations were carried out on January 12, 2018 by CBIZ Benefits & Insurance 

Services.

40. Retirement Benefit Obligations (continued)

Defined Benefits Plans: (continued)
The plans in Germany and the US expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary 
risk.

Investment risk

Interest rate risk

Longevity risk

Salary risk

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by 
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a 
plan deficit.
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the 
plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependents of plan members (widow and orphan benefits) is reinsured by an external 
insurance company.

The main actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

Pension plan

Post-retirement medical 
and dental plan

Life & medical 
insurance plan

Post-employment 
benefit plan

The plan assets of the post-employment benefit plan are cash and cash equivalents in a Federated Money Market Fund with an expected 
return of 3.90% (2016: 4.11%).

The actual return on plan assets was US$77,000 (2016: US$11,000).

The significant actuarial assumption for the determination of the defined obligation is the discount rate. If the discount rate is 100 basis 
points higher (lower), the effect on defined benefit obligation would be immaterial.

The Group expects to make a contribution of US$4,000,000 (2016: Nil) to the defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

45. Share Options

Scheme Option Schemes
The Company has two share option schemes in place - Scheme D and Scheme E. Scheme D was adopted on May 29, 2007 and expired 
on May 28, 2017, though its provisions shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects. Following the expiry of Scheme D, 
Scheme E was adopted on May 19, 2017 and will expire on May 18, 2027.

Both Scheme D and Scheme E are aimed for recognition of the contribution to the development and growth of the Group by the eligible 
persons. The scheme rules of both Scheme D and Scheme E are substantially identical and below are the summary of the principal terms 
of both schemes:

The Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to the following eligible persons (and their wholly owned companies) of 
the Company, its subsidiaries and any companies in which the Group holds any equity interest, to subscribe for shares in the Company:

(i) 

employees; or

(ii)  Directors; or

(iii) 

secondees; or

(iv) 

any shareholders of any member of the Group or invested entity or controlling shareholders or any holders of any securities issued 
by any member of the Group; or

(v) 

business partners; or

(vi) 

suppliers; or

(vii)  customers; or

(viii)  advisers of the Group.

Share options granted must be taken up within 21 days of the date of grant, upon payment of consideration to be determined by the 
Board for the grant thereof. Share options may be exercised at any time, subject to vesting conditions from the date of grant to the tenth 
anniversary thereof. The subscription price is set at the highest of: the closing price of the shares on the date of offer of the share option; 
or the average closing price of shares as stated in the daily quotation sheets issued by the Stock Exchange for the five trading days 
immediately preceding the date of offer.

The maximum number of shares in respect of which share options may be granted under the respective share option scheme is not 
permitted to exceed 30.0% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time or 10.0% of shares in issue as at the adoption 
date of the respective share option scheme. No person shall be granted an option which exceeds 1.0% of the shares in issue as at the 
date of offer in any 12-month period up to the date thereof.

Options may be exercised at any time after the first anniversary of the date of grant of the share option to the tenth anniversary of the date 
of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Directors of the Company, and will not be less than the higher of (i) the closing price of 
the Company’s share on the date of grant; and (ii) the average closing price of the shares for the five business days immediately preceding 
the date of grant.

45. Share Options (continued)

The following significant assumptions were used to derive the fair values using the Black-Scholes option pricing model:

Date of grant

Exercise price
HK$

Expected volatility
based on
historical volatility
of share prices

Yields of
Hong Kong
Government Bonds

Expected life of
share options

Expected annual
dividend yield

38%

1.207%
1.057%
0.778%

1.5%
1.5%
1.5%

The share options are vested in parts over 1 to 2 years from the date of grant.

Expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioral considerations.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the volatility of the share price. 
Because changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the directors’ opinion, the existing model 
does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the share options.

The weighted average closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the various dates on which the share options were 
granted during 2017 was HK$32.42.

The closing price of the Company’s shares immediately before the various dates on which the share options were granted ranged from 
HK$31.80 to HK$36.00 in 2017.

The weighted average closing prices of the Company’s shares immediately before various dates during 2017 and 2016 on which the share 
options were exercised were HK$38.21 and HK$30.75 respectively.

The Group recognized a total expense of US$2,246,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016: US$1,069,000) in relation to 
share options granted by the Company.

The fair values of the share options granted in 2017 measured at various dates on which the share options were granted ranged from 
HK$7.98 to HK$8.68. The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in 2017 was HK$8.11 per option.

The Company had 11,338,500 share options outstanding, (2016: 10,673,000), which represented approximately 0.62% (2016: 0.58%) 
of the issued share capital of the Company as at December 31, 2017. No option was cancelled during the year.

Total securities available for issue under Scheme D are 150,505,065 shares, which represented approximately 8.20% of the issued shares 
of the Company as at December 31, 2017. Total securities available for issue under Scheme E are 183,299,194 shares, which 
represented approximately 10.00% of the issued shares of the Company as at December 31, 2017.

46. Share Award Scheme

The purpose of the share award scheme is to recognize the contributions by certain eligible persons and to provide them with incentives 
in order to retain them for the continual operation and development of the Group and to attract suitable personnel for further development 
of the Group.

The share award scheme of the Company was adopted by the Board of Directors on January 9, 2008. The Board may from time to time at 
their absolute discretion select any eligible person for participation in the scheme as a selected grantee and determine the number of 
shares to be awarded or make reference to a nominal amount. The Board must cause to be paid to the trustee the purchase price and the 
related expenses. The trustee must either purchase shares from the market or subscribe for new shares. The trustee must hold the shares 
until they are vested in accordance with the scheme rules. When the selected grantee has satisfied all vesting conditions specified by the 
Board at the time of making the award and becomes entitled to the shares forming the subject of the award, the trustee will transfer the 
relevant vested shares together with the income derived therefrom (net of accrued interest) to the selected grantee.

An award of shares automatically lapses when, (i) a selected grantee who is an employee ceases to be an employee; or (ii) the subsidiary 
by which a selected grantee is employed ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company (or of a member of the Group); or (iii) a selected 
grantee who is a Director of the Company or a subsidiary ceases to be a director of the same; or (iv) an order for the winding-up of the 
Company is made or a resolution is passed (otherwise than for certain purposes) for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, and, in any 
such case, the award, unless the Board otherwise agrees, automatically lapses forthwith and all the awarded shares and related income of 
such award do not vest on the relevant vesting date but become returned shares for the purpose of the scheme.

Recognition of share-based payment expenses under the share award scheme during the year was US$1,947,000 (2016: 
US$8,379,000). During 2017, 1,036,500 shares (2016: 2,324,500 shares) were transferred to the awardees upon vesting.
