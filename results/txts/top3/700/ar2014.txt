Chairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

In 2013, the mobile Internet proliferated further and integrated more deeply with users’ daily lives in China. The year saw a 

significant shift in users’ traffic from PC to mobile devices, driving substantial changes across different sectors of the Internet 

industry, including communications, social networking, online games, online media and eCommerce. Mobile applications took 

the center stage and became the mainstream for many Internet services, reshuffling the competitive landscape.

Market  competition  intensified  as  competitors  aligned  their  strategies  with  the  mobile  opportunities  and  made  aggressive 

organic and inorganic investments along the value chain. Although business models on the mobile Internet are still evolving, 

we saw significant development and clearer paths towards mobile monetisation during the year. In particular, mobile games 

gained traction and experienced rapid growth in user adoption and spending, capitalising on the network effects of mobile 

social  platforms.  Performance-based  mobile  advertising  also  showed  early  signs  of  adoption.  New  services,  such  as  O2O 

services, emerged as mobile platforms achieved critical mass and mobile payment became more widely adopted in China.

Overall Financial Performance

In 2013, we registered solid growth in revenues and profits in a dynamic and competitive marketplace, while strengthening our 

leadership on the mobile Internet and continuing to invest in emerging opportunities such as O2O services, online video, and 

international expansion.

－  VAS. Our online game business achieved healthy growth in revenues, thanks to the strong performance of our major PC 

game titles in China and LoL in international markets, and the launch of new PC game titles. Our social network revenues 

grew  as  the  increase  in  item-based  sales  within  applications  on  our  open  platforms  offset  weakness  in  subscription 

services. Revenues from our online games and social networks also benefited from the initial contributions from smart 

phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin.

－  Online advertising. Our online advertising business benefited from the significant growth in performance-based social 

advertising  and  online  video  advertising,  as  well  as  solid  growth  in  traditional  brand  advertising.  Search  advertising 

revenues declined as we transferred our search business to Sogou, an associate of the Group, in September 2013.

－  eCommerce transactions. We  achieved  significant  growth  in  principal  eCommerce  transactions  revenues  under  a 

highly competitive market environment as we expanded our category and geographic coverage. Fees generated from 

transactions on our marketplaces also increased.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues and profits continued to grow compared to the same period last year.

－  VAS. Our online game business registered healthy growth, riding on increased popularity of our major PC game titles 

in  China  and  LoL  in  international  markets,  as  well  as  new  PC  game  titles.  The  business  also  benefited  from  new 

contributions from smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin. Our social networks benefited from growth 

in item-based sales within applications on our open platforms and new contributions from platform revenues related to 

smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin, partly offset by a decline in subscription revenues.

Annual Report 2013

－  Online advertising. The  year-on-year  revenue  growth  of  our  online  advertising  business  accelerated  in  the  fourth 

quarter  versus  the  previous  quarter,  mainly  driven  by  the  strong  increase  in  revenues  from  online  video  advertising. 

Performance-based social advertising continued to achieve significant revenue growth, while traditional brand advertising 

also  increased.  Search  advertising  revenues  declined  as  we  transferred  our  search  business  to  Sogou  in  September 

2013.

－  eCommerce transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we achieved significant year-on-year growth in revenues from 

principal eCommerce transactions. Fees generated from transactions on our marketplaces also increased.

Strategic Highlights

In  2013,  we  accelerated  the  mobilisation  of  our  services  and  reinforced  our  leadership  in  mobile  applications  in  China. 

Building on our strengths in communications and social platforms on mobile devices, we expanded the user base of various 

mobile applications, such as news, music and utilities, and launched new services on our core mobile platforms, such as 

Game  Center  and  Weixin  Payment,  which  enhanced  user  engagement,  while  opening  up  monetisation  opportunities.  We 

also extended our leadership in online games and open platforms, while expanding our online advertising business and our 

eCommerce transactions business.

We  forged  landmark  transactions  to  further  develop  our  search  and  eCommerce  businesses.  In  September  2013,  we 

announced a strategic partnership with Sogou for our search business, under which we invested in Sogou and merged our 

SoSo search-related businesses and certain other assets with Sogou. In March 2014, we announced a strategic partnership 

with JD.com for our eCommerce business, under which we invested in JD.com and merged our relevant eCommerce initiatives 

with JD.com. In addition to these two transactions which involve transfer of some of our businesses to our partners, we entered 

into other strategic transactions with partners including CSC, Dianping and Dididache. The strategic transactions with Sogou, 

JD.com and other partners entail close cooperation at both an investor and a business level, and reinforce our “open, win-

win”  philosophy  of  working  with  leading  teams  to  create  innovative  products  for  users,  and  to  build  a  healthy,  diversified 

ecosystem for the Internet industry. These transactions also free up our internal resources, both human and financial, to focus 

on leveraging the core strengths of our platforms and to develop new products such as O2O services, while enabling us to 

continue benefiting from the growth potential of the underlying industries via our significant equity stakes.

Divisional and Product Highlights

Key Platforms

In 2013, QQ and Qzone maintained their leading positions in communications and social networking in China. User account 

growth decelerated as users continued to shift their traffic from PC to mobile devices because fewer mobile users than PC 

users employ multiple accounts and mobile users’  usage pattern is more spread out across day parts as compared  to  PC 

users. For QQ, aggregate MAU increased modestly by 1% year-on-year to 808 million at the end of 2013, while PCU increased 

by 2% year-on-year to 180 million. During the year, we significantly expanded the mobile user base of QQ with enhanced user 

experience and enriched services such as Game Center. At the end of 2013, smart device MAU1 of QQ increased by 74% 

year-on-year to 426 million. For Qzone, aggregate MAU increased by 4% year-on-year to 625 million at the end of 2013. The 

year saw increased user activity and engagement on mobile. This was evidenced by a significant growth in smart device MAU 

of Qzone, which increased by 63% year-on-year to 416 million at the end of 2013, as well as a substantial increase in photo 

uploads on Mobile Qzone.

Combined  MAU  of  Weixin  and  WeChat  reached  355  million  at  the  end  of  2013.  During  the  year,  Weixin  enjoyed  rapid 

expansion and enhanced user engagement in China. With the launch of new services, such as Game Center, Official Accounts 

and  Weixin  Payment,  as  well  as  the  increasing  adoption  of  Moments,  Weixin  is  evolving  from  a  pure  communications 

service into a multi-functional platform. In international markets, WeChat achieved robust aggregate user growth, but we are 

increasingly focused on driving engagement in specific target geographic regions. Looking ahead, we aim to further improve 

user engagement on Weixin and WeChat by enhancing the core communications and social functions. We will also leverage 

Official Accounts and Weixin Payment to explore O2O and mobile eCommerce opportunities in China.

For our core media platforms, QQ.com, Tencent Microblog and Tencent Video, we sought to upgrade our content and enhance 

user experience, especially on mobile devices. For example, Tencent News achieved significant user growth during the year via 

mobile applications and plug-ins on Mobile QQ and Weixin. Going forward, we will further develop our portfolio of mobile media 

applications and enhance the monetisation of our mobile media traffic. We will also invest more aggressively in video content 

to further expand Tencent Video’s market presence, as we believe the online video industry is still at a formative stage and our 

massive media traffic provides us with competitive advantage.

VAS

In 2013, our open platforms continued to create value for the Internet industry, and enjoyed significant growth in users and 

revenues as a result. We believe we have become the partner of choice for application developers in China, offering access 

to our large logged-in user base, the network effect of our leading social platforms, our targeted advertising solutions, and our 

proprietary cloud-based infrastructure support. We are extending our open platforms to mobile and targeting to build a cross-

platform ecosystem.

1 

Since the fourth quarter of 2013, smart device MAU of QQ has been revised to denote the total number of QQ MAU that sent out one or 

more messages via Mobile QQ application on iOS or Android devices, or conducted other proactive operations via Mobile QQ application 

on iOS or Android devices, such as logging into Game Center or updating Qzone, at least once during the last calendar month prior to 

the relevant date. Comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current period’s presentation.

Annual Report 2013

The weakness in our VAS subscription services continued in 2013. This was primarily due to rapid adoption of smart phones 

by users, whereas our paid subscription services are traditionally focused on PC or feature phones. The weakness was also 

driven by our stringent measures to clean up certain user accounts acquired through mobile channels with low possibility 

of fee collection. To better align our VAS subscription services with the mobile Internet opportunities, we unified the product 

teams and product experiences between PC and smart phones, and introduced smart phone-oriented subscription services, 

such as Super VIP, during the year.

For online games, we consolidated our leading position in China in 2013. While major domestic PC game titles continued to 

deliver solid growth, we benefited significantly from increased contribution from international markets via LoL, and from the 

launch of new domestic PC game titles. In the fast-growing mobile game market, we launched our Game Center on Mobile QQ 

and Weixin, including a range of self-developed and third-party smart phone games. Riding on the extensive user reach and 

social network effect offered by Mobile QQ and Weixin, these games generated a revenue contribution of over RMB600 million 

for the fourth quarter of 2013, validating the distribution capabilities of our mobile platforms. We will continue to enrich our 

game portfolios for PC and mobile. In addition, we will strengthen our mobile distribution platforms to complement the rapid 

growth of our mobile games.

Online Advertising

Leveraging the growth of our media platforms and social platforms, our online advertising business expanded further in 2013, 

with revenue growth across the brand display and performance display categories. For brand display advertising, revenues 

from  our  online  video  platform  achieved  strong  growth,  driven  by  increased  inventories,  improved  pricing  and  enhanced 

recognition  from  advertisers.  Traditional  brand  advertising  also  registered  solid  revenue  growth.  For  performance  display 

advertising, revenues from our social platforms benefited from growth in impression volume and improved targeting. For search 

advertising, revenues declined as we transferred our search business to Sogou in September 2013. We believe Sogou is well-

positioned to grow its share in the PC and mobile search market after the completion of its integration with SoSo towards the 

end of 2013.

Longer term, we believe the fast-growing user base and traffic of our mobile platforms will increasingly become an attractive 

proposition for advertisers. We are exploring different formats of mobile advertising on our platforms to capture the emerging 

opportunities.

eCommerce Transactions

In  2013,  our  principal  eCommerce  transactions  business  experienced  strong  growth  in  transaction  volume  and  revenues 

as we enhanced our geographic presence, expanded our product range and improved our eCommerce infrastructure. Our 

marketplaces also registered growth in fee income as we improved product selection and customer service.

Under  our  strategic  partnership  with  JD.com,  we  transferred  our  Wanggou  B2C  and  Paipai  C2C  marketplace  businesses, 

logistics personnel and assets, as well as a minority stake in Yixun to JD.com, and JD.com has a call option to acquire our 

remaining stake in Yixun in future. We will support JD.com’s growth in the physical goods eCommerce business by offering 

level 1 access points at Mobile QQ and Weixin, as well as support from other key platforms to JD.com. Both parties will also 

cooperate on online payment services to improve users’ online shopping experience.

Outlook and strategies for 2014

During  2014,  we  intend  to  leverage  our  leading  communications  and  social  applications  to:  (1)  support  a  broad  portfolio 

of  associated  applications  spanning  activities  such  as  games,  entertainment,  information,  and  utilities;  (2)  popularise 

our  application  stores  and  application  distribution  platforms;  and  (3)  build  a  prosperous  ecosystem  for  O2O  and  mobile 

eCommerce activities. We also strive to leverage our platforms to accelerate the growth of mobile games, while reinforcing our 

leadership in PC client games.

We  will  continue  investing  heavily  in  certain  long-term  projects  we  deem  strategic,  including:  (1)  purchasing  content  and 

improving  user  experience  for  our  online  video  service;  (2)  marketing  and  popularising  our  WeChat  service  in  selected 

international  markets;  and  (3)  encouraging  uptake  of  our  payment  solutions,  for  example  via  subsidies  to  consumers  and 

merchants.

We aim to deepen our relationships with strategic business partners such as CSC, Dianping, Dididache, JD.com and Sogou, 

among others, providing our partners with our full platform support and bringing their products and services to our users.

DIVIDEND

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD1.20 per share (2012: HKD1.00 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2013, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the AGM. Such proposed dividend will be payable on 

30 May 2014 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 21 May 2014.

APPRECIATION

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like  to  express  my  sincerest  appreciation  to  our  employees  for  their  hardwork,  valuable 

dedication  and  contributions,  which  are  fundamental  for  the  Group’s  success  on  future  development.  I  would  also  like  to 

extend my heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders and stakeholders for their continued trust, support and steadfast confidence 

in us. Together, we will continue to build a prosperous ecosystem for the Internet industry.

Note:

In view of the evolution of Weixin and WeChat from communications services to multi-functional platforms, we have revised the definition 

of combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat since the fourth quarter of 2013 to denote the total number of user accounts that sent out one or 

more messages via Weixin/WeChat or conducted other proactive operations on Weixin/WeChat, such as logging into Game Center or updating 

Moments, at least once during the last calendar month prior to the relevant date. Comparative figures have been restated to conform to the 

current period’s presentation.

Key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2013 are as follows:

－  MAU and PCU of QQ grew slightly compared to the same period last year, reflecting users’ trend of shifting from PCs to 

mobile devices. User base of Mobile QQ continued to expand, with smart device MAU increasing by 74% year-to-year to 

426 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.

－  Weixin and WeChat have been evolving from communications services to multi-functional platforms offering not only 

messaging  activities  but  also  social  networking  activities  and  mobile  games,  as  evidenced  by  increased  usage  of 

Moments and Game Center.

－  MAU of Qzone grew modestly compared to the same period last year. Smart device MAU increased by 63% year-on-year 

to 416 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.

Total revenues

－  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 3% to RMB11,932 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 from the third 

quarter of 2013. Online games revenues remained broadly stable at RMB8,475 million. This mainly reflected the growth 

and full quarter contribution of revenues from smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin, the increased 

popularity of LoL across China and international markets, and contributions from new domestic PC game titles such as 

Blade and Soul, offset by weaker seasonality in China in the fourth quarter. Social networks revenues increased by 8% to 

RMB3,457 million. This was primarily driven by the growth and full quarter contribution of platform revenues from smart 

phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin, partly offset by a decline in subscription revenues.

－  Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 8% to RMB1,497 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 

from  the  third  quarter  of  2013.  This  primarily  reflected  growth  in  revenues  from  online  video  advertising  and  from 

performance-based advertising, which more than offset the revenue impact of transferring our online search business to 

Sogou in September 2013.

－  Revenues from our eCommerce transactions business increased by 41% to RMB3,324 million for the fourth quarter of 

2013 from the third quarter of 2013. This was mainly driven by growth in our principal eCommerce transactions volume 

as a result of seasonal effects, including seasonal promotional activities towards the end of the year.

Cost of revenues. Cost  of  revenues  increased  by  17%  to  RMB8,198  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2013  from  the  third 

quarter of 2013. This mainly reflected an increase in cost of merchandise sold. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues 

increased to 48% for the fourth quarter of 2013 from 45% for the third quarter of 2013. The following table sets forth our cost 

of revenues by line of business for the fourth quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2013:

Total cost of revenues

－   Cost of revenues for our VAS business decreased by 4% to RMB3,886 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 from the 

third quarter of 2013. This mainly reflected a decrease in sharing and content costs primarily due to weaker seasonality 

for licensed PC game titles, partly offset by an increase in bandwidth and server custody fees.

－ 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  53%  to  RMB1,011  million  for  the  fourth  quarter 

of  2013  from  the  third  quarter  of  2013.  This  primarily  arose  from  a  periodic  review  of  user  video  viewing  patterns, 

prompting  our  decision  to  accelerate  the  amortisation  of  video  content  costs  commencing  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 

2013, which resulted in a true up for the shortfall in such amortisation for previous quarters. Excluding the impact of 

the acceleration of video content costs amortisation and the related true up, which amounted to RMB317 million on 

aggregate, cost of revenues for our online advertising business would have increased by 5% sequentially.

－ 

Cost of revenues for our eCommerce transactions business increased by 43% to RMB3,164 million for the fourth quarter 

of 2013 from the third quarter of 2013. This was mainly driven by an increase in cost of merchandise sold due to growth 

in our principal eCommerce transactions volume.

Annual Report 2013

 
 
 
 
Other gains, net. Other gains, net for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased to RMB405 million from RMB66 million for the third 

quarter of 2013. This primarily reflected increases in disposal gains related to certain investees, subsidies and tax rebates as 

well as dividend income, partially offset by recognition of impairment provision for selected investees in the fourth quarter of 

2013.

Selling and marketing expenses.  Selling  and  marketing  expenses  increased  by  39%  to  RMB2,033  million  for  the  fourth 

quarter of 2013 from the third quarter of 2013. This was mainly driven by an increase in advertising spending on eCommerce 

platforms, WeChat, media platforms, and new PC and smart phone games. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing 

expenses increased to 12% for the fourth quarter of 2013 from 9% for the third quarter of 2013.

General and administrative expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  6%  to  RMB2,770  million  for  the 

fourth quarter of 2013 from the third quarter of 2013. This mainly reflected an increase in staff costs. As a percentage of 

revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2013 from 17% for the third quarter 

of 2013.

Finance income/(costs), net. We recorded finance income, net of RMB6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 

finance costs, net of RMB22 million for the third quarter of 2013. The change mainly reflected higher foreign exchange gain 

on our foreign currency denominated debts due to exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Income tax expense.  Income  tax  expense  decreased  by  15%  to  RMB808  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2013  from  the 

third quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013, no deferred tax liabilities were recognised in respect of withholding taxes 

applicable on unremitted retained earnings expected to be paid by our PRC subsidiaries to their overseas parent companies, 

whereas RMB135 million was recognised for such deferred tax liabilities in the previous quarter. In addition, a reversal of 

income tax expense was recorded in the fourth quarter which resulted from the qualification of tax exemption of a subsidiary in 

China.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 1% to 

RMB3,911 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 from the third quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company increased by 3% to RMB4,498 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 from the third quarter of 2013.

Total revenues

－  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 26% to RMB44,985 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 from 

the year ended 31 December 2012. Online games revenues increased by 34% to RMB31,966 million. The increase 

primarily reflected growth in our major PC game titles in China and LoL in international markets as well as contribution 

from launch of new PC game titles. Social networks revenues increased by 9% to RMB13,019 million. This was primarily 

driven by growth in item-based sales within applications on our open platforms, partly offset by a decline in subscription 

revenues.  Revenues  from  our  online  games  and  social  networks  also  benefited  from  initial  contributions  from  smart 

phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin.

－  Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 49% to RMB5,034 million for the year ended 31 December 

2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. This mainly reflected significant growth in revenues from performance-

based social advertising and online video advertising. Revenues from traditional brand advertising also increased, though 

at a more moderate rate. Revenues from search advertising declined as we transferred our search business to Sogou in 

September 2013.

－  Revenues from our eCommerce transactions business increased by 121% to RMB9,796 million for the year ended 31 

December 2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. This was primarily driven by a significant increase in principal 

eCommerce transactions volume. Fees generated from transactions on our marketplaces also increased.

costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 46% for the year ended 31 December 2013 from 41% for 

the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to a revenue mix shift towards the eCommerce transactions business. The

－ 

Cost of revenues for our VAS business increased by 28% to RMB15,384 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 

from the year ended 31 December 2012. This mainly reflected an increase in sharing and content costs due to business 

growth. Bandwidth and server custody fees as well as staff costs also increased.

－ 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  60%  to  RMB2,777  million  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. The increase partly arose from a periodic review of user video

higher bandwidth and server custody fees as well as commissions payable to advertising agencies. Excluding the impact 

of the acceleration of video content costs amortisation and the related true up, which amounted to RMB317 million on 

aggregate, cost of revenues for our online advertising business would have increased by 42%.

－ 

Cost of revenues for our eCommerce transactions business increased by 120% to RMB9,239 million for the year ended 

31 December 2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. This mainly reflected an increase in cost of merchandise 

sold due to growth in our principal eCommerce transactions volume.

Other gains/(losses), net. We recorded other gains, net of RMB904 million for the year ended 31 December 2013, compared 

to other losses, net of RMB284 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The change primarily reflected a decrease in 

impairment provision for selected investees, as well as increases in disposal gains related to certain investees and subsidies 

and tax rebates.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 90% to RMB5,695 million for the year ended 

31 December 2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. This mainly reflected a step up in marketing activities related 

to WeChat in international markets and an increase in advertising spending on online games, mobile utilities and eCommerce 

platforms. Staff costs also increased as our business expanded. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expenses 

increased to 9% for the year ended 31 December 2013 from 7% for the year ended 31 December 2012.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 29% to RMB9,988 million for the 

year ended 31 December 2013 from the year ended 31 December 2012. This primarily reflected increases in research and 

development expenses, staff costs (including share-based compensation) as well as other administrative expenses such as 

office-related costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 17% for the year ended 

31 December 2013 from 18% for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Finance costs, net.  Finance  costs,  net  decreased  by  76%  to  RMB84  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2013  from 

the year ended 31 December 2012. This mainly reflected the recognition of foreign exchange gains on our foreign currency 

denominated debts due to exchange rate movements in the year ended 31 December 2013, compared to foreign exchange 

losses in the last year.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 64% to RMB3,718 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 from 

the year ended 31 December 2012. This primarily reflected higher profit before income tax and the absence of a reversal of 

income tax expense for a subsidiary in China which was qualified in the fourth quarter of 2012 to enjoy a lower CIT rate for 

2011 and 2012. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of withholding 

taxes  applicable  on  unremitted  retained  earnings  expected  to  be  paid  by  our  PRC  subsidiaries  to  their  overseas  parent 

companies.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 22% 

to  RMB15,502  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2013  from  the  year  ended  31  December  2012.  Non-GAAP  profit 

attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 19% to RMB17,063 million for the year ended 31 December 2013

including non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP profit for the period, non-GAAP net margin and 

non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited

As at 31 December 2013, RMB6,039 million of our financial resources (30 September 2013: RMB8,449 million) were held 

in deposits denominated in non-RMB currencies. Since there are no cost-effective hedges against the fluctuation of  RMB 

and no effective manner to generally convert a significant amount of non-RMB currencies into RMB, which is not a freely 

exchangeable  currency,  there  is  a  risk  that  we  may  experience  a  loss  as  a  result  of  any  foreign  currency  exchange  rate 

fluctuations in connection with our deposits.

Strong corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The Board views effective corporate 

governance practices as priority, with the aim of providing our investors a thorough understanding of the Group’s management 

and how the different businesses of the Group are managed. Our belief is that investors will recognise significant long-term 

value when the Group’s businesses are conducted in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in 

hand with strong corporate governance, and we believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will create trust with 

the public and ultimately create value for investors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company  has  complied  with  the  applicable  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code,  except  for  the  deviation  from 

the code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the role of the chairman and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the 

retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes at 

an appropriate time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s 

execution of this strategy.

By  discharging  its  responsibilities,  the  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be 

responsible, and these matters reserved for the Board have been separately defined, and are reviewed periodically, to ensure 

that the Company maintains the proper level of corporate governance. In this regard, the Board:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual budget and business plan

appoints the CEO, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned

approves the Company’s financial statements, quarterly, interim and annual reports

determines the Group’s communication policy

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control  and  regulatory  compliance  procedures  in 

place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders

management

‧  monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the business of the Group

‧ 

‧ 

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  dedicates  certain  matters  which  require  particular 

time, attention and expertise to be devoted to its Committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt 

with by the Committees as they require independent oversight and specialists input. As such, the Board has established five 

Committees  to  assist  the  Board:  Audit  Committee,  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  Nomination 

Committee and Remuneration Committee. Each of the Committees has terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers 

and authorities. All Committees report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

The Company’s governance structure of these Committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor

reviews the Company’s financial information

The work of the Committees during the year 2013 is set out on pages 62 to 65.

57

Annual Report 2013

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the Company Secretary, with a view to ensuring the Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expenses for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe ongoing education and training, as well as participation in director education programs, is important for maintaining 

a current and effective Board. In order to ensure the directors are aware of their responsibilities as directors of the Company, 

and for the Company to take advantage of their rich mix of knowledge and experience, it is our practice that new directors have 

to undergo an orientation programme and the existing directors have to attend a comprehensive, formal and tailored training 

on their duties and responsibilities as directors provided by external professional advisors that includes written materials, oral 

presentations and meetings with senior management team. New directors would also receive a directors’ handbook on their 

responsibilities under the Listing Rules, applicable legal requirements and other regulatory requirements and the business 

and governance policies of the Company. Trainings have been and will continue to be provided by external advisors  on  a 

regular  basis  in  relation  to  any  updates  of  laws  and  regulations  (including  the  Listing  Rules)  which  relate  to  the director’s 

responsibilities.

Maintaining  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  integrity  cannot  depend  solely  on  the  Board’s  efforts,  each  of  the 

Group’s employees is also required to contribute to such cause. The Company thus distributes a code of conduct policy which 

emphasises on honesty and respect is distributed to all employees and forms part of their service contracts.

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  in 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

review of the Shareholders Communication Policy on a regular basis

formulation and implementation of the Board Diversity Policy which was approved by the Board on 14 August 2013

trainings have been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and the laws

Company Secretary attends trainings in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements

informal updates and structured monthly updates on the Company’s performance, position and prospects are provided 

to the directors

adoption of the Insider Dealing Policy and Disclosure of Inside Information Policy in accordance with SFO and Listing 

Rules. Both policies were approved by the Board on 11 January 2013

Tencent Holdings Limited

58

Chairman and CEO

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and CEO of the Company. This is at variance with code provision A.2.1 of the CG 

Code, which provides that the roles of Chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be performed by the 

same individual. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and chief executive should be clearly established and 

set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and CEO must be proficient in 

IT knowledge and be sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, in order to promote 

the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the role of the Chairman and CEO may 

create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate Committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time to 

make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board and 

Committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for discussion for 

all items. During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-executive directors (including 

the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive directors, presenting diversified perspectives 

for the Chairman to consider.

The Board is therefore of the view that there are adequate balance of power and safeguards in place. Nevertheless, the Board 

will continue to monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary changes at an appropriate time.

Composition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board comprised a total of eight directors, with three executive directors, two non-

executive directors and three independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2013 and up to the 

date of this annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 39 to 42 of this annual report.

In order for the Group to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspective and in order for the directors to 

ensure that they give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request the directors to disclose to the Company 

quarterly the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant commitments. 

The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that the number of 

independent  non-executive  directors  must  represent  at  least  one-third  of  the  Board.  The  Board  believes  that  the  balance 

between  the  executive  directors  and  non-executive  directors  is  reasonable  and  adequate  to  provide  sufficient  checks  and 

balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

59

Annual Report 2013

The Board values the importance of independent judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group 

by  expressing  their  views  and  actively  participate  in  Board  and  Committee  meetings  and  to  bring  independent  judgment 

and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, performance, conflicts of interest and management process, with the 

shareholders’ interests being the utmost important  factor. Further, in compliance with Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules,  one 

of our independent non-executive directors has the appropriate professional qualifications or accounting or related financial 

management expertise, who provides valuable advice from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from 

each independent non-executive director a confirmation annually of his independence and the Nomination Committee of the 

Company has conducted an annual review and considers that all independent non-executive directors are independent, taking 

into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of 

each independent non-executive director. Mr Ian Charles Stone was re-elected as an independent non-executive director in 

the 2013 annual general meeting.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

Appointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the right membership of the Board, we can benefit from the right set 

of skills, experience and diversity of perspective to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain the established formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 

It is our corporate governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the 

Chairman)  should  be  subject  to  re-election  at  regular  intervals  and  the  resignation  and  removal  of  any  director  should  be 

explained with reasons. In the 2013 annual general meeting, Mr Zhang Zhidong and Mr Ian Charles Stone were retired and re-

elected; so did Mr Jacobus Petrus Bekker, who was re-elected in accordance with Article 86(3) of the Articles of Association.

Code provision A.4.2 of CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

Tencent Holdings Limited

60

Since the Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by 

rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year, code provision A.4.2 of CG Code 

is deviated. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and development of the 

Group. At present, the Chairman’s continuing presence in the Board is vital to assure sustainable development of the Group. 

Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the relevant provision 

in the Articles of Association has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

As Mr Charles St Leger Searle, who was re-elected in 2010 annual general meeting, was not considered at the 2013 annual 

general meeting, code provision A.4.2 of CG Code is deviated. Mr Charles St Leger Searle’s re-election will be considered at the 

AGM. The Board considers that such deviation from code provision A.4.2 of CG Code does not have any material impact on 

the operation of the Group as a whole.

Board Activity

The Board meets four times during the year as a minimum and, during the year of 2013, it met seven times. The attendance 

of each director at Board and Committee meetings, whether in person or by means of electronic communication, is detailed in

Annual Report 2013

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed on a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial 

and operational performances, approved the annual, interim and quarterly results of the Group, the appointments of director, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The Company Secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agendas for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  Company  Secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The Company Secretary sends the agendas, 

board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least three days in advance of each 

Board meeting and Committee meetings, and to keep the directors updated on the Group’s financial performance and latest 

developments.  If  any  director  raises  any  queries,  steps  will  be  taken  to  respond  to  such  queries  as  promptly  and  fully  as 

possible. If there is a potential conflict of interest involving a substantial shareholder or a director, such director would declare 

his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s senior management team 

when necessary. The directors may also retain independent professional advisors at the Company’s expense if necessary.

The Company Secretary ensures that there is a good and timely flow of information to the Board. The Company Secretary is 

responsible for taking minutes of all Board and Committee meetings. The directors receive the draft minutes for comments 

shortly after each meeting and final minutes are available for review and inspection by the directors at any time.

THE COMMITTEES

As described above, the Board has established five Committees which have delegated responsibilities and report back to the 

Board: the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, the Investment Committee, the Nomination Committee, 

and  the  Remuneration  Committee.  The  roles  and  functions  of  these  Committees  are  set  out  in  their  respective  terms  of 

reference. All relevant terms of reference (except for the Investment Committee) are available on the Company Website and the 

Stock Exchange’s website.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce, Mr Ian Charles Stone 

(both  are  independent  non-executive  directors)  and  Mr  Charles  St  Leger  Searle.  Mr  Iain  Ferguson  Bruce  chairs  the  Audit 

Committee  and  together  with  Mr  Charles  St  Leger  Searle,  have  appropriate  professional  qualifications  and  experiences  in 

financial matters.

Tencent Holdings Limited

The Audit Committee meets not less than twice a year; in 2013 the Audit Committee met five times. Individual attendance 

of each Audit Committee member is set out on page 61. In addition to the members of the Audit Committee, meetings were 

attended by the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of Internal Audit and the Head of Internal Control and the external auditor at 

the invitation of the Audit Committee.

Tencent Holdings Limited

The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2013. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is set 

out on page 61.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of each director.

During 2013, the Remuneration Committee:

‧ 

reviewed  and  recommended  to  the  Board  in  respect  of  the  remuneration  policies  and  structure  of  the  Company  by 

benchmarking peer companies with similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages is competitive to 

recruit the best talents in the industry and to retain key staffs

directors and members of the senior management team

reviewed  and  approved  compensation  awards  granted  to  senior  management  team,  to  recognise  their  valuable 

contributions to the Company and to provide incentives for future performances

In conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured  that  no  individual  and  his  associates  were  involved  in  determining  his  own  remuneration.  It  also  ensured  that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned to 

the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategy. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

In  respect  of  non-executive  directors,  the  Remuneration  Committee  has  reviewed  fees  payable  taking  into  account  the 

particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

ACCOUNTS, RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects are presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position, to give the directors a balanced and understandable assessment of 

the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides all necessary and relevant 

information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and information it needs to discharge their responsibilities. 

The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the Auditor’s Report.

65

Annual Report 2013

The Board also has the responsibility to oversee the risks undertaken by the Group, and to actively consider, analyse and 

formulate strategies to control the risks the Group is exposed to, and determines the level of risk the Company wishes to and is 

able to take. The senior management team monitors these risks and develops effective systems and mechanisms to mitigate 

risks to an acceptable level as determined by the Board. The senior management team reports to the Board periodically and 

whenever necessary on the risks the Group faces and the actions taken to mitigate them.

An  adequate  and  effective  internal  control  system  is  key  to  mitigate  risk  and  to  safeguard  shareholders’  interests  and  the 

Group’s assets against any unauthorised use or disposition. The internal control system should also ensure the maintenance 

of proper accounting records for the provision of reliable financial information for internal use or for publication and to ensure 

that the Group is in compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. The Board is responsible for maintaining such internal 

control system. The Board has established a set of procedures to provide effective internal controls, which includes:

‧ 

establishing a distinct organisational structure with defined lines of authority and control responsibilities. Relevant group, 

division or department heads actively participate in the preparation of strategic plans for achieving annual operational 

and financial targets. These plans serve as the foundation for the preparation of the Group’s annual budget by which 

resources are allocated in accordance with identified and prioritised business opportunities. The Board approves the 

annual operating plan and budget on an annual basis

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

if  there  are  any  variances  against  the  annual  budget,  these  variances  will  be  analysed  and  actions  will  be  taken  if 

necessary to rectify any deficiencies noted

IA performs independent review of the operational areas and presents its findings and prospective audit plan to the Audit 

Committee on a quarterly basis

IC facilitates the senior management team to ensure controls in operational processes are efficient and effective, and 

regularly communicates with the Audit Committee

The  IA  and  IC  provide  valuable  support  to  the  Company’s  internal  control  system.  The  IA  reviews  different  business  and 

functional operations and activities of the Group with a special focus on high risk areas. The IA also conducts ad hoc reviews 

in  areas  of  concern  identified  by  the  senior  management  team.  If  the  IA  identifies  any  deficiencies,  the  relevant  group, 

division or department heads will be notified on such deficiencies and will be rectified, following up with the implementation 

of audit recommendations. If the IA considers that the deficiency is a significant internal control weakness, such matter will 

be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and the Board if necessary. The IC oversees the overall risk management 

and the effectiveness of internal control based on the COSO Framework. The IC also provides advice on the setting up and 

implementation  of  policies  and  processes  to  promote  effective  internal  control.  The  overall  risk  management  and  internal 

control status will be reported to the Audit Committee.

Tencent Holdings Limited

The  Audit  Committee  reviews  the  internal  control  system  annually  on  behalf  of  the  Board.  The  Board  is  satisfied  that  the 

Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  function  is  adequately  resourced  with  staff  of  appropriate  qualifications 

and  experience,  and  they  receive  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and  development.  Based  on  the  report  from  the 

Audit Committee, the Board is satisfied that the Company’s internal audit function is adequately resourced to manage the 

Group’s  risks  and  safeguard  the  Group’s  assets,  and  that  the  external  audit  process  has  been  effective.  The  Board,  with 

the recommendation of the Audit Committee, is satisfied that the Group has complied with the provisions regarding internal 

controls as required under the CG Code and is not aware of any significant issues that would have an adverse impact on the 

effectiveness and adequacy of the internal control system.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of 

the Group’s operations, business and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in annual general meetings and other general meetings or other proper means. As such, the Company has developed and 

maintains the Shareholders Communication Policy which is available on the Company Website.

The Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the senior management team, under 

usual circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to the Company in an open manner. 

All directors attended the 2013 annual general meeting. The Company’s external auditor will also attend the annual general 

meeting  to  answer  questions  relating  to  the  conduct  of  the  audit,  the  auditor’s  report  and  auditor  independence.  The 

Company’s shareholders may also propose candidates for election as a director of the Company according to the procedures 

set out in the Company Website.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the 

requisition not less than one-tenth of the paid up capital of the Company carrying the right of voting at general meetings of 

the Company shall at all times have the right, by written requisition to the Board or the Company Secretary, to require an 

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

67

Annual Report 2013

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, separate resolutions will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a poll, 

detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions from 

shareholder on the voting procedures can be answered before the poll voting started. An external scrutineer will be appointed 

to monitor and count the votes cast by poll. Poll results will be posted on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s 

website after each general meeting.

Apart from participating in the Company’s general meetings, the Company’s shareholders are provided with contact details of 

the Company, such as telephone number, email address and postal address which are also available on the Company Website, 

in order to enable them to make any query that they may have. Shareholders may send their enquiries to the Board directly 

through these means. Shareholders may also contact the Company’s Hong Kong branch share registrar, Computershare Hong 

Kong Investor Services Limited, if they have any enquiries about their shareholdings and entitlements to dividends.

69

Annual Report 2013

To the shareholders of Tencent Holdings Limited

(incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)

We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Tencent  Holdings  Limited  (the  “Company”)  and  its  subsidiaries 

(together, the “Group”) set out on pages 72 to 187, which comprise the consolidated and company statements of financial 

position  as  at  31  December  2013,  and  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive 

income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 

and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong 

Companies  Ordinance,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of 

consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted 

our  audit  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing.  Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical 

requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 

statements are free from material misstatement.

70

Independent Auditor’s Report  Tencent Holdings LimitedAn  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated 

financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks 

of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements 

that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 

appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 

evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

OPINION

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 

the Group as at 31 December 2013, and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 

International Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements 

of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

OTHER MATTERS

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not 

assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent  Holdings  Limited  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  in  the  Cayman  Islands.  The  address  of  its  registered 

office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The shares of the 

Company have been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) since 

16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally engaged in the provision of Internet and mobile value-added services (“VAS”), online advertising services and 

eCommerce transactions services to users in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interest in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefits of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer without 

making any payment; and

• 

the right to control the management and financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2013(All amounts in RMB unless otherwise stated)Tencent Holdings Limited1 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 10) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  approved  for  issue  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the 

Company (the “Board”) on 19 March 2014.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 

convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and derivative financial instruments.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures

(a)  New standards, revised standards and amendments to standards adopted by the Group

The following new standards, revised standards and amendments to standards have been adopted by the 

Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2013:

• 

Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income. The 

main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented 

in ‘other comprehensive income’ (“OCI”) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to 

profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The Group has applied this amendment from 

1 January 2013 and present the OCI on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit 

or loss subsequently.

• 

IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was revised in June 2011. The changes on the Group’s accounting policies 

has been as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and 

expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount 

rate  to  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset).  The  Group  has  applied  this  revised  standard  from  1 

January 2013 and management considered that this revised standard does not have any impact on the 

Group’s consolidated financial statements as it does not have a defined benefit plan.

• 

Amendment to IFRS 1, ‘First time adoption’, on government loans. This amendment addresses how 

a first-time adopter would account for a government loan with a below-market rate of interest when 

transitioning to IFRS. It also adds an exception to the retrospective application of IFRS, which provides 

the same relief to first-time adopters granted to existing preparers of IFRS financial statements when 

the requirement was incorporated into IAS 20 in 2008. The Group has applied this revised standard 

from  1  January  2013  and  management  considered  that  this  revised  standard  does  not  have  any 

impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as it does not have any government loans.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(a)  New standards, revised standards and amendments to standards adopted by the Group (Cont’d)

• 

Amendment  to  IFRS  7,  ‘Financial  instruments:  Disclosures’,  on  asset  and  liability  offsetting.  The 

amendment  require  new  disclosure  requirements  which  focus  on  quantitative  information  about 

recognised financial instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position, as well as those 

recognised financial instruments that are subject to master netting or similar arrangements irrespective 

of whether they are offset. The Group has not entered into any netting arrangement and management 

of the Group considered that the adoption of amendment to IFRS 7 does not have a significant impact 

on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

• 

IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on existing principles by identifying the concept 

of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated 

financial  statements  of  the  parent  company.  The  standard  provides  additional  guidance  to  assist 

in  the  determination  of  control  where  this  is  difficult  to  assess.  The  Group  has  applied  this  revised 

standard from 1 January 2013 and such adoption does not have a significant impact on the Group’s 

consolidated financial statements.

• 

IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement 

rather than its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. 

Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of 

an arrangement. A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. 

Joint ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; joint ventures 

are accounted for under the equity method. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer 

permitted.  The  Group  has  applied  this  revised  standard  from  1  January  2013  and  management 

considered that this standard does not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial 

statements.

• 

IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms 

of  interests  in  other  entities,  including  joint  arrangements,  associates,  structured  entities  and  other 

off  balance  sheet  vehicles.  The  Group  has  applied  this  standard  on  disclosures  in  its  consolidated 

financial statements.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(a)   New standards, revised standards and amendments to standards adopted by the Group (Cont’d)

• 

IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing 

a  precise  definition  of  fair  value  and  a  single  source  of  fair  value  measurement  and  disclosure 

requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and 

US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be 

applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs. The adoption 

of  this  standard  only  affects  disclosures  on  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  in  the  Group’s 

consolidated financial statements.

• 

The Group also adopted the IASB’s improvements to IFRS published in June 2011, which are relevant 

to the Group and effective from 1 January 2013. Such amendments have no significant impact to the 

consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The  Group  has  early  adopted  Amendment  to  IAS  36,  ‘Impairment  of  assets’  for  the  first  time  for  the 

consolidated financial statements.

Amendment  to  IAS  36,  ‘Impairment  of  assets’,  on  the  recoverable  amount  disclosures  for  non-financial 

assets. This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been 

included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. The amendment is not mandatory for the Group until 1 January 

2014.  However  the  Group  has  decided  to  early  adopt  the  amendment  from  1  January  2013  and  such 

adoption does not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards, amendments to standards and interpretation not yet adopted

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretation are not effective for the financial 

year  beginning  1  January  2013,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  these 

consolidated financial statements.

• 

Amendment  to  IAS  32,  ‘Financial  instruments:  Presentation’,  on  asset  and  liability  offsetting.  This 

amendment relates to the application guidance in IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, and 

clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance 

sheet. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of Amendment to IAS 32 and intends to adopt this 

amendment no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

• 

Amendment  to  IAS  39,  ‘Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement’–‘Novation  of 

derivatives’. This amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a 

hedging instrument to a central counterparty meets specified criteria. The Group is yet to assess the 

full impact of Amendment to IAS 39 and intends to adopt this standard no later than the accounting 

period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

• 

IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 

assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces 

the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 

9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured at fair 

value  and  those  measured  at  amortised  cost.  The  determination  is  made  at  initial  recognition.  The 

classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the 

contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains 

most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken 

for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in 

other  comprehensive  income  rather  than  the  income  statement,  unless  this  creates  an  accounting 

mismatch. The Group is yet to assess the full impact  of IFRS 9.

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards, amendments to standards and interpretation not yet adopted (Cont’d)

• 

Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27, ‘Consolidation for investment entities’. These amendments 

mean that many funds and similar entities will be exempt from consolidating most of their subsidiaries. 

Instead, they will measure them at fair value through profit or loss. The amendments give an exception 

to  entities  that  meet  an  ‘investment  entity’  definition  and  which  display  particular  characteristics. 

Changes have also been made in IFRS 12 to introduce disclosures that an investment entity needs 

to make. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 and 

intends to adopt this standard no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 

2014.

• 

IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy that is not income tax. The 

interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when should a 

liability be recognised. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRIC 21 and intends to adopt this 

interpretation no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

• 

IASB’s improvements to IFRS published in May and November 2012. In May and November 2012, 

IASB  published  its  annual  improvements  projects,  which  made  some  amendements  to  IFRSs  to 

clarify some accounting treatments/disclosure requirements under new/revised IFRSs and eliminate 

inconsistency.  These  improvements  are  not  effective  for  financial  year  beginning  1  January  2013. 

Management  does  not  expect  these  amendments  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Group’s 

consolidated financial statements.

There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and would be expected to have a 

significant impact on the Group.

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with 

the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have 

been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration  transferred  includes  the  fair  value  of  any  asset  or  liability  resulting  from  a  contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis,  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest’s  proportionate  share  of  the  recognised 

amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to  be  an  asset  or  liability  is  recognised  in  accordance  with  IAS  39  either  in  profit  or  loss  or  as  a 

change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-

measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the income statement.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Partial disposals

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is 

re-measured to its fair value at the date when control or significant influence is lost, with the change 

in carrying amount recognised in the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount 

for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint ventures 

or  financial  asset.  In  addition,  any  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income 

in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets 

or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 

respect of that entity are reclassified to the income statement.

(b)  Separate financial statements

In  the  Company’s  statement  of  financial  position,  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at 

cost less impairment. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries 

are  accounted  for  by  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  dividends  received  and  receivable.  In  addition,  the 

contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in Note 10(d)), a controlled structured entity, 

is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust” first, and then will be transferred to the “Shares 

held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for the acquisition for the shares 

of the Company.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements (Cont’d)

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying 

a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using 

the  equity  method  of  accounting  and  are  initially  recognised  at  cost,  and  the  carrying  amount  is  increased  or 

decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The 

Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment 

loss.

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where 

appropriate.

The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive  income.  The  cumulative  post-acquisition  movements  are  adjusted  against  the  carrying  amount 

of the investment. When the Group’s share of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 

including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The  Group  determines  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  investments  in 

associates  are  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference 

between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.4  Joint arrangements

The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements as of 1 January 2013. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint 

arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and 

obligations each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be 

joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profits  or  losses  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  ventures),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interest  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The change in accounting policy 

has been applied as from 1 January 2013.

The change in accounting policy has had no significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments in joint 

ventures are impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between 

the recoverable amount of the joint ventures and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.5 

Investment in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The  cost  of  associates/joint  ventures  acquired  in  stages,  except  for  the  change  from  an  associate  to  a  joint 

venture;  is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interest  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any 

additional  consideration  transferred  as  of  the  date  when  it  becomes  associates/joint  ventures.  A  gain  or  loss 

on  re-measurement  of  the  previously  held  interest  is  taken  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  Any  other 

comprehensive income recognised in prior periods in relation to the previously held interest is also taken to the 

income statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.7  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated 

financial  statements  are  presented  in  RMB,  which  is  both  the  functional  currency  of  the  Company  and 

presentation currency of the Group.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-

sale financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised 

cost of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences 

related to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation 

differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, 

are included in other comprehensive income.

2.7  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(c)  Group companies

The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary 

economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are translated into 

the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.8  Fixed assets

All fixed assets are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge. 

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  cost  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

3 - 5 years

5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to fixed assets when completed and ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.13).

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in 

“Other gains/(losses), net” in the income statement.

2.9 

Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  costs  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives of 50 years.

Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each 

reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.10 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease or capitalised in 

construction in progress upon completion of construction.

2.11 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of 

the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities 

and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

(b) 

Licensed online contents

The licensed online contents mainly include video contents. They are initially recognised and measured at 

cost. Licensed online contents are amortised using an accelerated method based on estimated consumption 

patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other  intangible  assets  mainly  include  licence,  computer  software  and  technology  and  non-compete 

agreements. They are initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value of intangible assets 

acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally two to seven years) using 

the  straight-line  method  reflects  the  pattern  in  which  the  intangible  asset’s  future  economic  benefits  are 

expected to be consumed.

2.12 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 10(d)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as  “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment to “Share premium”.

2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 

at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial 

assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 

reporting date.

2.14 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans 

and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which 

the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets are quoted in an active 

market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

(i) 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 

category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 

classified as non-current.

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Loans to associates”, “Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the 

statement of financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 

classified in any other category. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 

to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.14 Financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date - the date on which the Group 

commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs 

for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value 

through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income 

statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments 

have  expired  or  have  been  transferred  and  the  Group  has  transferred  substantially  all  risks  and  rewards 

of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 

subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective 

interest method.

Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale financial 

assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.

When securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 

value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement as gains 

and losses from investment securities.

Dividends on available-for-sale financial assets equity instruments are recognised in the income statement 

when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

2.15 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when 

there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 

basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired 

and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or 

more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or 

events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets 

that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss 

is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may 

measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income 

statement.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-

sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the securities below its cost is 

considered  as  an  indicator  that  the  securities  are  impaired.  If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-

sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and 

the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income 

statement  –  is  removed  from  other  comprehensive  income  and  recognised  in  the  income  statement. 

Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the 

income statement.

2.17 Derivative financial instruments

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are accounted for at fair value through 

profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 

recognised immediately in the income statement in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.18 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted 

average method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.19 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for merchandise sold or services performed in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable and other receivables is expected in one year or 

less, they are classified as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.20 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term  highly 

liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

2.21 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  share  capital  (treasury  share),  the  considerations 

paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 

equity  holders  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued,  any 

consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.23 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request 

the Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are 

met. If the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial assets under 

the put option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows 

under the put option. The financial liability is initially debited to equity at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group 

revises its estimates of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual 

and revised estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present 

value of revised estimated future cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the 

adjustments will be recognised as income or expenses in the income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.24 Borrowings and long-term notes

Borrowings and long-term notes issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over their period using the effective interest 

method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Long-term notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation 

to settle the liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.25 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 

except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this 

case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of 

an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither 

accounting nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 

have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 

related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.26 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The Group contributes on a monthly basis to various defined contribution benefit plans organised by the 

relevant governmental authorities. The Group’s liability in respect of these plans is limited to the contributions 

payable in each period. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. Assets of the plans are held 

and managed by government authorities and are separated from those of the Group.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share award schemes), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity 

instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of  the  employee 

services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments of the Group is recognised as an expense 

over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  the  period  over  which  all  of  the  specified  vesting  conditions  are  to  be 

satisfied, and credited to share-based compensation reserve under equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 

options granted by using an option-pricing model – Black-Scholes valuation model (the “BS Model”), which 

includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) but excludes 

the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award shares, the total 

amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant 

date. The Group also adopts valuation technique to assess the fair value of other equity instruments of the 

Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation expenses, which are recognised in the consolidated financial statement, are treated as part of 

the “Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

2.26 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

At each reporting period end, the Group and the Company revise their estimates of the number of options 

and awarded shares that are expected to ultimately vest. They recognise the impact of the revision of original 

estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement of the Group and in the “Investments in subsidiaries” 

of the Company, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the remaining vesting period.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

2.27 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 

the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.28 Revenue recognition

The  Group  principally  derives  revenues  from  provision  of  VAS,  online  advertising  services  and  eCommerce 

transactions services in the PRC.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  are  derived  principally  from  the  provision  of  online  games,  community  value-added 

services and applications across various Internet and mobile platforms.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.28 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

The VAS can be paid by way of prepaid cards and tokens (represented a specific amount of payment unit) 

sold  by  the  Group  through  channels  such  as  sales  agents  appointed  by  the  Group,  telecommunication 

operators, broadband service providers, Internet cafes and banks. The end users can register the prepaid 

cards  and  tokens  to  their  user  accounts  in  the  Group’s  platforms  and  then  access  the  Group’s  online 

products or relevant services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid cards and tokens are deferred and recorded 

as “Deferred revenue” in the statement of financial position (see Note 27). The amounts are then recognised 

as revenue based on the actual utilisation of the payment unit: (i) when the payment unit is used to purchase 

services, the revenue is recognised when the related services are rendered; (ii) when the payment unit is 

used to purchase virtual products/items in the Group’s Internet platforms, the revenue is recognised over the 

estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/items or over the expected user relationship.

Certain VAS are directly delivered to the Group’s customers through the platforms of various subsidiaries 

of  telecommunication  operators  in  the  PRC,  namely  China  Mobile  Communications  Corporation  (“China 

Mobile”),  China  United  Network  Communications  Group  Company  Limited  (“China  Unicom”)  and  China 

Telecommunications  Corporation  (“China  Telecom”).  These  operators  collect  the  relevant  service  fees 

(the  “Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees”)  on  behalf  of  the  Group  and  are  entitled  to  certain  percentages 

commission fee (defined as “Mobile and Telecom Charges”). The Mobile and Telecom Charges are withheld 

and deducted from the gross Internet and Mobile Service Fees collected by the operators from the users, 

with the net amounts remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Internet and Mobile Service Fees as 

revenue on a gross basis and treats the Mobile and Telecom Charges as cost of revenues.

The  Group  also  opens  its  Internet  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  through  entering 

into cooperation agreements with them. The games/applications designed, developed and hosted by these 

developers are made available to the users on the Group’s Internet and mobile platforms. The developers 

are primarily responsible for the obligations under the games/applications to the end users. Under the terms 

of these cooperation agreements, the Group pays the developers a pre-determined percentage of the fees 

paid by and collected from end users for the virtual products/items utilised in these games/applications. The 

Group recognises the related revenue on a net basis because it acts as an agent in the arrangements. The 

Group also defers the related revenue over an the estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/items 

or over the expected user relationship periods as there is an implicit obligation of the Group to maintain and 

allow access of the users of the games/applications operated by the developers through its platforms.

Revenues derived from these arrangements are presented as revenue from VAS in the income statement.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues are mainly derived from display advertisements to instant messaging clients, 

and on portals, social networks and other platforms operated by the Group. It also includes income derived 

from performance based advertisements in which the revenue is linked to actual performance measurement. 

Commissions payable to advertising agencies are recognised as a component of the cost of revenues.

For  brand  display  advertising,  advertising  contracts  with  terms  within  one  year  are  entered  into  with  the 

advertisers and their advertising agencies and revenues are recognised ratably over the period in which the 

advertisements are displayed.

For performance based advertising, the Group introduces Internet users to its advertisers mainly through its 

performance based pay-for-click systems and charges advertisers on a per click basis when the users click 

on the displayed links. Revenue for performance based advertising is primarily recognised on a per click 

basis when the users click on the displayed links.

(c) 

eCommerce transactions

Revenues  derived  from  eCommerce  transactions  business  of  the  Group  primarily  arise  from  sales  of 

merchandise  through  the  Group’s  Internet  platforms.  The  Group  recognises  revenues  from  merchandise 

sales and related costs on a gross basis when it acts as a principal. Following the guidance under IAS 18 

‘ Revenue’, whether the Group acts as a principal is based on a number of criteria, including whether it is a 

primary obligor, whether it is subject to inventory risk, whether it has latitude in establishing prices, whether 

it has latitude in selecting suppliers, in a transaction. When the Group is not a principal and is instead acting 

as an agent, revenues are recognised on a net basis which is based on a pre-determined percentage of the 

sales.

For merchandise sold under the eCommerce transactions business, the customers place their orders online 

with a commitment made at a fixed selling price. Payment for the purchased merchandise is made either 

before delivery or upon delivery. When the Group is acting as a principal, revenues, net of discounts and 

return allowances and value-added tax, are recognised when the merchandise is physically delivered to the 

respective customers. Return allowances, which reduce the gross amount of revenues, are estimated based 

on historical experience.

2.29 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

2.30 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

2.31 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.32 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.33 Dividends distribution

Dividends  distribution  to  the  Company’s  shareholders  is  recognised  as  a  liability  in  the  Group  and  Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders.

2.34 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development  costs  previously  recognised  as  expenses  are  not  recognised  as  assets  in  subsequent  periods. 

Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the assets are ready for use on a straight-line 

basis over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding five years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The Group mainly operates in the PRC with most of the transactions settled in RMB. The conversion 

of RMB denominated balances into foreign currencies is subject to the rates and regulations of foreign 

exchange control promulgated by the PRC government. Therefore, to maintain the flexibility in activities 

including  payment  of  dividends,  share  repurchases  and  offshore  investments  and  operations,  the 

Group holds some monetary assets denominated in United Stated Dollar (“USD”), Hong Kong Dollar 

(“HKD”),  Euro  (“EUR”),  Korea  Won  (“KRW”)  and  New  Taiwan  Dollar  (“TWD”)  subject  to  certain 

thresholds stated in its treasury mandate, and borrows some loans denominated in USD from time to 

time. This exposes the Group to foreign exchange risk.

There is no other written policy to manage the foreign exchange risk in relation to USD, HKD, EUR, 

KRW and TWD as management considers that such risk could not be effectively reduced in a low-cost 

way.

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (Cont’d)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2013,  the  Group  reported  exchange  gains  of  approximately 

RMB310  million  (2012:  exchange  losses  of  approximately  RMB21  million)  as  a  result  of  RMB 

appreciation.  The  gains/losses  were  recorded  in  “Finance  costs,  net”  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement for the year ended 31 December 2013.

At 31 December 2013, if USD, EUR, HKD, KRW and TWD had strengthened/weakened by 5% (2012: 

5%) against RMB with all other variables held constant, the profit before income tax for the year would 

have been approximately RMB506 million lower/higher (2012: RMB221 million lower/higher), mainly 

as a result of net foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of net monetary liabilities denominated in 

USD, EUR, HKD, KRW and TWD.

(ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group, classified as available-

for-sale financial assets. The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk. To manage its price risk 

arising from the investments, the Group diversifies its portfolio. The investments made by the Group are 

either for the purpose of improving investment yield and maintaining high liquidity level simultaneously, 

or for strategic purpose. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

The available-for-sale financial assets are held for strategic rather than trading purposes. The Group 

does not actively trade these investments.

The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of available-for-sale 

financial assets at the end of the reporting period. If equity prices of the respective instruments held by 

the Group had been 5% (2012: 5%) higher/lower as at 31 December 2013, the other comprehensive 

income would have been approximately RMB603 million (2012: RMB272 million) higher/lower.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group has interest-bearing assets including receivables in associates, term deposits with initial 

term of over three months and cash and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in 

Notes 11, 17 and 18.

The  Group’s  interest  rate  risk  arises  from  borrowings  and  long-term  notes  issued  by  the  Group. 

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially 

offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings and long-term notes issued at fixed rates expose the 

Group to fair value interest rate risk. There is no other written policy on managing the interest rate risk 

and management is to minimise its impact on the income statement.

Other financial assets and liabilities do not have material interest rate risk.

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2013,  if  the  average  interest  rate  on  variable  interest-bearing 

borrowings had been 5% (2012: 5%) higher/lower, the Group’s profit before income tax for the year 

would have been approximately RMB3 million (2012: RMB5 million ) lower/higher.

The Company had no variable interest-bearing liabilities.

(b)  Credit risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its cash and deposits (including restricted cash) placed with 

banks and financial institutions, other investments, as well as accounts and other receivables.

The carrying amount of each class of the above financial assets represents the Group’s maximum exposure 

to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

To  manage  this  risk,  deposits  are  mainly  placed  with  state-owned  financial  institutions  in  the  PRC  and 

reputable international financial institutions outside of the PRC. There has been no recent history of default 

in relation to these financial institutions.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk (Cont’d)

For accounts receivable, a large portion of Internet and Mobile Service Fees is derived from the co-operative 

arrangements with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. If the strategic relationship with the 

telecommunications operators is terminated or scaled-back; or if the telecommunications operators alter the 

co-operative arrangements; or if they experience financial difficulties in paying us, the Group’s VAS might be 

adversely affected in terms of recoverability of receivables.

To manage this risk, the Group maintains frequent communication with the telecommunication operators 

to  ensure  the  co-operation  is  effective.  In  view  of  the  history  of  co-operation  with  the  telecommunication 

operators  and  the  sound  collection  history  of  receivables  due  from  them,  management  believes  that  the 

credit risk inherent in the Group’s outstanding accounts receivable balances from these telecommunications 

operators is low (see Note 15 for details).

For  accounts  receivable  from  advertising  customers,  which  are  mainly  advertising  agencies,  the  credit 

quality of each customer is assessed, which takes into account its financial position, past experience and 

other factors. Normally, prepayments representing a certain percentage of the total service fees for  each 

advertising service are required.

(c) 

Liquidity risk

The  Group  aims  to  maintain  sufficient  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities.  Due  to  the 

dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group’s finance department maintains flexibility in funding 

by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents.

The table below analyses the Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities by relevant maturity groupings 

based on the remaining period since the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date. The 

amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months 

equal their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 

structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

In  order  to  maintain  or  adjust  the  capital  structure,  the  Group  may  adjust  the  amount  of  dividends  paid  to 

shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or repurchase the Company’s shares.

The Group monitors capital by regularly reviewing the gearing ratio. The gearing ratio is calculated as total liabilities 

divided by total assets. The total capital is the “total equity” of the Group as shown in the consolidation statement 

of financial position, which is also equal to total assets less total liabilities.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have 

been defined as follows:

• 

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

• 

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end 

of the reporting period, with the resulting value discounted back to present value; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

Valuation processes of the Group (Level 3)

The Group has a team that manages the valuation logistics of level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. 

The team manages the valuation logistics at least once every quarter, in line with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates. On an annual basis, the team would also manage the valuation logistics, and use valuation techniques to 

determine the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments by themselves.

The  valuation  of  the  level  3  instruments  mainly  included  private  funds  and  unlisted  companies.  As  these 

investments are not traded in an active market, their fair value have been determined using discounted cash flow 

valuation techniques if applicable. Major assumptions used in the valuation include historical financial results, 

assumptions about future growth rates and estimate of weighted average cost of capital (WACC), etc.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 

definition, seldom equal to the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk 

of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 

addressed below:

(a)  Recognition of revenues and accounts receivable related to VAS

For VAS delivered through the platforms of telecommunication operators, the Internet and Mobile Service 

Fees  and  the  Mobile  and  Telecom  Charges,  or  the  net  amount  of  the  two,  are  confirmed  and  advised 

by  these  operators  to  the  Group  on  a  monthly  basis.  For  those  Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees  not  yet 

confirmed/advised by the operators at the time of reporting the financial results of the Group, management of 

the Group estimates the amounts receivable based on the historical data.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (Cont’d)

(a)  Recognition of revenues and accounts receivable related to VAS (Cont’d)

As  at  31  December  2013,  the  balance  of  accounts  receivable  to  be  confirmed  by  China  Mobile,  China 

Unicom and China Telecom and their branches, subsidiaries and affiliates was estimated to be RMB564 

million (2012: RMB706 million).

Were the actual outcome to differ by 5% (2012: 5%) from management’s estimates, the Group would need 

to:

• 

reduce the revenue and accounts receivable by RMB28 million (2012: RMB35 million) if unfavourable; 

or

• 

increase the revenue and accounts receivable by RMB28 million (2012: RMB35 million) if favourable.

(b)  Recognition of share-based compensation expenses

As mentioned in Note 2.26(c), the Group has granted share options to its employees. The directors have 

used the BS Model to determine the total fair value of the options granted, which is to be expensed over the 

vesting  period.  Significant  judgement  on  parameters,  such  as  risk  free  rate,  dividend  yield  and  expected 

volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the BS Model (Note 21).

There  was  no  share  option  granted  to  employees  in  2013.  The  fair  value  of  options  granted  for  the  year 

ended 31 December 2012 determined using the BS Model was approximately HKD15 million (equivalent to 

approximately RMB12 million).

In  addition,  the  Group  granted  awarded  shares  to  its  employees  at  an  aggregate  fair  value  of  HKD1,615 

million (equivalent to approximately RMB1,287 million) during 2013 (2012: HKD1,862 million (equivalent to 

approximately RMB1,520 million)).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition of share-based compensation expenses (Cont’d)

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees of share options/awarded shares who 

will stay within the Group at the end of the vesting periods (“Expected Retention Rate of Grantees”) in order 

to determine the amount of share-based compensation expenses charged into the income statement. As at 

31 December 2013, the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees was assessed to be 91% (2012: 91%).

If the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees had been increased/decreased by 5% (2012: 5%), the amount 

of share-based compensation expenses would be increased/decreased by RMB78 million (2012: RMB64 

million).

(c)  The estimates of the lifespan of virtual products/items provided in the Group’s Internet and mobile platforms

As mentioned in Note 2.28(a), the end users purchase certain virtual products/items provided in the Group’s 

Internet and mobile platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the lifespan of the virtual 

products/items or the expected user relationship periods. The Group uses the available information, including 

the historical user pattern and behavior and the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/

items, to estimate the lifespan of these products/items. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the 

estimated lives of the permanent life virtual products/items on a timely basis.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespan of the virtual products/items (provided and to be 

provided), which may differ from the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the 

revenue being recognised on a different basis than in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (Cont’d)

(d) 

Income taxes

The  Group  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  numerous  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgement  is  required  in 

determining  the  worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes.  There  are  many  transactions  and  calculations  for 

which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit 

issues  based  on  estimates  of  whether  additional  taxes  will  be  due.  Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these 

matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income 

tax and deferred income tax liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

Were the actual final outcome (on the judgement areas) to differ by 5% from management’s estimates, the 

Group would need to:

• 

Increase  the  income  tax  liabilities  by  RMB66  million  (2012:  RMB21  million)  and  the  deferred  tax 

liabilities by RMB72 million (2012: RMB66 million), if unfavourable; or

• 

Decrease  the  income  tax  liabilities  by  RMB66  million  (2012:  RMB21  million)  and  the  deferred  tax 

liabilities by RMB72 million (2012: RMB66 million), if favourable.

(e)  Estimation of put option liabilities

The  Group  granted  some  put  options  to  the  non-controlling  interest  owners  that  they  have  the  right  to 

request the Group to repurchase their equity interests in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries when certain 

conditions are met. The repurchase prices were determined by making reference to the revenue or profit 

to be generated by those subsidiaries in future periods. The Group will initially recognise a financial liability 

at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the put option arrangement, and  at  the 

end of each subsequent period, the Group will revisit their estimations. If the Group revises its estimates 

of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised 

estimated  cash  outflows  and  the  adjustments  will  be  recognised  as  income  or  expenses  in  the  income 

statement.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s internal 

reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based on these 

reports.

In  light  of  the  increasing  integration  between  the  personal  computer  (“PC”)  and  mobile  Internet  and  the  latest 

development of the Group’s business, the Internet value-added services (“IVAS”) and the mobile and telecommunications 

value-added services (“MVAS”) segments have been combined into VAS segment and the revenue categories previously 

under  IVAS  and  MVAS  have  been  adjusted  from  1  January  2013  onwards,  both  in  the  internal  reports  to  the  chief 

operating decision-makers and in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The comparative figures have been 

restated to comply with the new presentation. The Board believes that the above changes in segment information better 

reflect current market trends, as well as resource allocation and future business development of the Group.

The Group has following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012:

– 

– 

– 

– 

VAS;

Online advertising;

eCommerce transactions; and

Others

Other segments of the Group mainly comprise of the provision of trademark licensing, software development services 

and software sales.

The  chief  operating  decision-makers  assess  the  performance  of  the  operating  segments  mainly  based  on  segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit/(losses)  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for the operating segments as a whole and therefore they are not 

included in the measure of the segments’ performance which is used by the chief operating decision-makers as a basis 

for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Interest income, other gains/(losses), 

net, finance costs, net and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to operating segments. Most of the goodwill is related to 

the operating segment of VAS.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The management 

calculates  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  based  on  ratios  of  EV(enterprise  value)/EBITDA(earnings  before  interest,  tax, 

depreciation and amortisation) of several public comparable companies multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU 

and a discount for the lack of marketability.

The key assumptions used for the calculations of fair value less costs to sell in 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

EV/EBITDA

Discount for the lack of marketability

2013

2012

4.1-6.3x

25%

6.0-8.0x

25%

The public comparable companies are considered with factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and 

financial risk.

Based  on  the  assessment  made  by  management,  no  provision  for  impairment  on  goodwill  was  necessary  as  at  31 

December 2013.

All subsidiaries undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary 

undertakings held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The 

parent  company  further  does  not  have  any  shareholdings  in  the  preference  shares  of  subsidiary  undertakings 

included in the Group.

Note:

(i) 

The amount represents share-based compensation expenses arising from grants of share options and awarded shares of 

the Company to employees of subsidiaries in exchange for their services provided to the subsidiaries, which were deemed 

to be investment made by the Company into these subsidiaries.

(ii) 

All these balances are unsecured and interest-free and their repayments are neither planned nor likely to occur in the 

foreseeable future.

(iii) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these subsidiaries. Nevertheless, under 

certain contractual agreements entered into with the registered owners of these subsidiaries, the Company and its other 

legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their financial and 

operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting the 

majority  of  votes  at  meetings  of  such  authorities.  In  addition,  such  contractual  agreements  also  transfer  the  risks  and 

rewards of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as 

controlled structured entities of the Company.

(iv) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non-controlling interests of the subsidiaries are not significant to the 

Group, and the Group did not separately disclose relevant subsidiaries’ summarised financial information.

(b)  Significant restrictions

Cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB44,818 million 

are held in Mainland China and are subject to local exchange control regulations. These local exchange control 

regulations provide for restrictions on payment of dividends, share repurchase and offshore investments, etc.

(c)  Amounts due from/(to) subsidiaries

The  amounts  due  from/(to)  subsidiaries  as  at  31  December  2013  represented  current  account  balances 

maintained  by  the  Company  with  certain  subsidiaries.  All  balances  are  unsecured  and  interest-free  and  the 

balances are repayable on demand. As at 31 December 2013, the amounts due from subsidiaries were neither 

past due nor impaired.

(d)  Consolidation of structured entities

As  mentioned  in  Note  10(a)(iii)  above,  the  Company  has  consolidated  the  operating  entities  within  the  Group 

without  any  legal  interests.  In  addition,  due  to  the  implementation  of  the  share  award  schemes  of  the  Group 

mentioned  in  Note  21(b),  the  Company  has  also  set  up  a  structured  entity  (“Share  Scheme  Trust”),  and  its 

particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering  and  holding  the  Company’s  shares  acquired  for  share  award  schemes 

which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can 

derive benefits from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the 

directors of the Company consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Company contributed approximately RMB278 million (2012: RMB121 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.

(e)  Disposal of a subsidiary

In October 2012, the Group entered into an agreement with a third party, a company listed on the Shanghai Stock 

Exchange (the “Buyer”), to sell all its equity interests (65.8%) held in Beijing Manyougu Information Technology 

Limited Company (“Manyougu”) (“Manyougu Disposal”). Manyougu is principally engaged in game development 

in PRC and had been accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group until October 2013.

In  October  2013,  the  majority  equity  interests  of  Manyougu  held  by  the  Group  have  been  disposed  of  and 

Manyougu ceased to be accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group since October 2013.

The disposal gain recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement for Manyougu 

Disposal was RMB189 million.

(i) 

In June 2013, the Group acquired additional non-redeemable preference shares in Kingsoft Internet Security Software 

Holdings Limited (“KIS”), an existing associate of the Group which is principally engaged in development and sales of 

Internet  security  software  and  antivirus  software,  for  a  cash  consideration  of  approximately  USD47  million  (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB290  million),  and  increased  the  Group’s  equity  interest  in  KIS  from  approximately  10.0%  to 

approximately 18.0%.

(ii) 

In 2013, the Group subscribed for ordinary shares and preference shares in Sogou Inc. (“Sogou”) (“Sogou acquisition”), 

representing  40.9%  of  the  share  capital  of  Sogou  and  24.8%  of  the  voting  interest  in  Sogou,  for  a  total  consideration 

comprising  of  search  related  businesses  and  certain  other  assets  of  the  Group  and  a  net  cash  consideration  of 

approximately  USD516  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB3,179  million).  Sogou  is  principally  engaged  in  the 

provision of Internet search services, as well as in the development and operations of a suite of Internet applications in the 

PRC, including Sogou Pinyin, Sogou Browser and Sogou Web Directory. Since the Group has representatives in Sogou’s 

board of directors, Sogou is accounted for as an associate of the Group.

(iii) 

In addition to the above, the Group acquired some other associates or made additional investments in existing associates 

for an aggregate consideration of RMB702 million during the year ended 31 December 2013. They are principally engaged 

in provision of online community services, online game development and other Internet-related businesses.

(iv)  During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group made impairment provision of RMB44 million (2012: RMB195 

million) for investments in associates based on the assessment with reference to business performance and recoverable 

value of associates.

The directors are of the view that there was no associate which is material to the Group, the Group did not separately disclose 

relevant associates’ summarised financial information.

Management has assessed the level of influence that the Group has on certain associates and determined that it has significant 

influence even though the shareholding is below 20% because of the board representation. Consequently, these investments 

have been classified as associates.

(b) 

Investments in redeemable preference shares of associates

The Group held certain redeemable preference shares of the associates, which are principally engaged in online community 

services,  online  game  development  and  other  Internet-related  businesses.  The  redemption  prices  of  the  relevant  shares  are 

agreed at not less than their original subscription prices.

During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group also made impairment provision of approximately RMB17 million (2012: 

RMB449 million) for the investments in redeemable preference shares of certain associates based on the assessment made with 

reference to the business performance and recoverable values of the underlying associates.

(c) 

Loans to associates

As at 31 December 2013, the carrying amount of the loans to associates of the Group amounted to RMB184 million (2012: 

RMB162 million). The aggregate principal amount of the loans to associates is RMB179 million (2012: RMB160 million), which 

are required to be repaid in 2 years. These loans bear interest rates of 4.0% to 6.0% per annum or are interest-free.

(d) 

Transactions with associates

During the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group entered into cooperation agreements with certain associates, 

pursuant to which the associates operate their games/applications on the Group’s Internet platforms, which are available to the 

users of the Group. The Group pays the associates a pre-determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from end users 

for the virtual products/items utilised in their games/applications. In the whole arrangement, the Group acts as an agent and 

recognises the related revenue on a net basis. In 2013 and 2012, the revenue recorded by the Group from the above cooperation 

with associates was not material.

As at 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group was entitled to certain call options and conversion options associated with 

its interests in associates. The directors of the Company considered that the fair values of such options were insignificant 

and accordingly, the Group did not separately recognise these options in the consolidated financial statements.

There are no contingent liabilities relating to the Group’s interest in the associates.

granted a credit period of 90 days after full execution of the contracted advertisement orders.

considered necessary after management had performed assessment on their credit quality with reference to historical 

counterparty default rates.

value as at 31 December 2013.

20  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with limited liabilities in the PRC, appropriation of net profits (after offsetting accumulated losses from prior years) should be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profits (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Funds. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With approvals obtained from their respective boards of directors of these companies, the Reserve Fund can be used to offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

This share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and restricted share award schemes adopted by non-

wholly owned subsidiaries (Note 21(d)).

in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheets for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant;

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(a)  Share option schemes (Cont’d)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the BS Model to determine the fair value of the options granted, 

which is to be expensed over the vesting period. There is no share option granted to employees in 2013. The 

weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2012 was HKD87.89 per 

option (equivalent to approximately RMB71.78 per option).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgement on parameters, such as risk free rate 

(2012: 0.40%), dividend yield (2012: 0.36%) and expected volatility (Note) (2012: 48.1%), is required to be 

made by the directors in applying the BS Model.

Note:

The expected volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is determined based on the 

average daily trading price volatility of the shares of the Company.

The outstanding share options as of 31 December 2013 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis as 

at their grant date. The first tranche can be exercised after a specified period ranging from one to five years from 

the grant date, and then the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent year.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted two share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”), both of which are managed 

by an independent trustee appointed by the Group (the “Trustee”) as of 31 December 2013. The vesting period of 

the awarded share is determined by the Board.

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Share award schemes (Cont’d)

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2013  was 

HKD311.24  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB248.05  per  share)  (2012:  HKD245.95  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB200.81 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2013 were divided into two to six tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant date. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from three 

months to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(c)  Employee incentive scheme

In 2011, the Group established an employee incentive scheme in a form of limited liability partnership (the “EIS”) 

for incentive purpose pursuant to a shareholders’ resolution passed at the 2011 annual general meeting of the 

Company held on 11 May 2011. The Board may, at its absolute discretion, select any employee of the Group to 

participate in the EIS by subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. The total cash contribution 

by selected employees is limited to approximately RMB80 million. The participating employees are entitled to all 

the economic benefits generated by the EIS (if any) after a specified vesting period under the EIS, ranging from 4 

to 7 years. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which acts as a general partner of the EIS manages and in 

essence, controls it. The EIS is therefore consolidated by the Company. In addition, because certain continuous 

service conditions are attached to the partnership interest subscribed by the employees, the EIS is accounted for 

as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the expenses of which for the years ended 31 December 

2013 and 2012 were considered not significant to the Group by the directors of the Company.

(d)  Share options and restricted share award schemes adopted by non-wholly owned subsidiaries

Certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share 

option and/or restricted share award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting 

periods of the share options and awarded shares are determined by the board of directors of these subsidiaries 

at their sole discretion. Similar to the share option/award schemes adopted by the Company, the share options or 

restricted shares of the subsidiaries so granted are normally vested by several tranches. Some non-wholly owned 

subsidiaries’ participants have the right to request the Group to repurchase their vested equity interest in those 

non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries  (“Repurchase  Transaction”).  For  certain  of  those  participants,  the  Group  have 

discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Group or by cash. For the 

Repurchase Transaction which the Group having settlement options, there are certain portions that the directors of 

the Company are currently of the view that they would be settled by equity instruments of the Group and they are 

accounted for using the equity-settled share-based payment method. The remaining portion is accounted for as 

cash-settled share-based payments.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of vesting periods of the options and awarded shares (the “Expected Retention Rate”) in order to determine the 

amount of share-based compensation expenses charged to the income statement. As at 31 December 2013, the 

Expected Retention Rate was assessed to be 91% (31 December 2012: 91%).

these software and technology transfer, while the charge to income statement represents tax impacts of the reversal of the temporary 

differences as a result of the amortisation of the costs of these software and technology.

As at 31 December 2013, the Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of RMB443 million (2012: RMB251 

million) in respect of cumulative tax losses amounting to RMB2,057 million (2012: RMB910 million). These tax losses

All local employees of the subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover 

pension, medical and other welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for 

the contribution to these social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the 

relevant regulations, the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group 

as required by the above social security plans are principally determined based on percentages of the basic salaries of employees, 

subject to a certain ceiling, and are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities. Contributions to the plans are expensed 

as incurred. The applicable percentages used to provide for insurance premium and welfare benefit funds are listed below:

37  TAX EXPENSE

(a) 

Income tax expense

(i) 

Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands corporate income tax (“CIT”)

The Group was not subject to any taxation in these jurisdictions for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 

2012.

(ii)  Hong Kong profits tax

Hong Kong profits tax provision has been provided at the rate of 16.5% (2012: 16.5%) on the estimated 

assessable profits for the year ended 31 December 2013.

(iii)  PRC corporate income tax

CIT provision was made on the estimated assessable profits of entities within the Group incorporated in the 

PRC, calculated in accordance with the relevant regulations of the PRC after considering the available tax 

benefits from refunds and allowances.

Pursuant  to  the  PRC  Corporate  Income  Tax  Law  passed  by  the  Tenth  National  People’s  Congress  on  16 

March 2007 (the “CIT Law”), the CIT rate for domestic and foreign enterprises has been unified at 25%, 

effective from 1 January 2008.

In  2011,  certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  in  the  PRC  were  approved  as  High  and  New  Technology 

Enterprise, and accordingly, they were subject to a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15% for a 3-year period 

from 2011 to 2013 according to the applicable CIT Law.

(a) 

Income tax expense (Cont’d)

(iii)  PRC corporate income tax (Cont’d)

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Group are exempt from CIT for two years, followed by a 50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the 

next three years, commencing either from the first year of commercial operations or from the first year of 

profitable operation after offsetting tax losses generated from prior years.

(iv)  United States corporate income tax

United States CIT provision was provided during the year ended 31 December 2013 for the entities within 

the Group which were incorporated in the United States with estimated assessable profits, at applicable tax 

rate of 36% (2012: 36%).

(v)  Corporate income tax in other countries

CIT provision has been provided for the year ended 31 December 2013 for the entities within the Group 

which were incorporated in Europe, East Asia and South America to the extent that there were estimated 

assessable profits under these jurisdictions, at applicable tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 35% (2012: from 

12.5% to 35%).

(vi)  PRC withholding tax

According to applicable PRC tax regulations, dividends distributed by a company established in the PRC 

to  a  foreign  investor  with  respect  to  profits  derived  after  1  January  2008  are  generally  subject  to  a  10% 

withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong and meets the conditions or requirements 

under  the  double  taxation  arrangement  entered  into  between  the  Mainland  China  and  Hong  Kong,  the 

relevant withholding tax rate will be reduced from 10% to 5%. Hence, the Group used 5% to accrue the 

withholding  tax  for  certain  Hong  Kong  intermediate  holding  companies  which  are  expected  to  fulfill  the 

aforesaid conditions.

The tax on the Group’s profit before income tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax 

rate of 25% for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: 25%), being the tax rate of the major subsidiaries of the 

Group before enjoying preferential tax treatments. The difference is analysed as follows:

39  EARNINGS PER SHARE (Cont’d)

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. During the year ended 31 December 2013, these 

share options and restricted shares either had anti-dilutive effect or their dilutive effect was insignificant to the 

Group.
