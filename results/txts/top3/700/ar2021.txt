BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Strategic Progress and Outlook

While 2020 was an unprecedentedly challenging year, we believe our solid operational and financial results testify to our focus 

on user value and technology innovation. Below are some highlights from our key products and business lines:

Communication and Social

Throughout the past decade, Weixin has evolved from an instant messaging app to a service meeting the digital needs of over 

1.2 billion users. Each day, more than 120 million users post in Moments, 360 million users read Official Accounts articles and 

400 million users access Mini Programs. SMEs and brands increasingly connect with users via Mini Programs and Weixin Pay, 

and annual transaction volume generated from Mini Programs more than doubled year-on-year in 2020.

4

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementUsers are increasingly uploading personal videos, and sharing them with friends, in Weixin Moments and chats. They can now 

share informative videos publicly through our product innovation – Video Accounts. Video Accounts also enable brands and 

enterprises to broaden their audience reach and drive transactions, especially via links to Mini Programs.

Within QQ, we focused on enhancing interactive experiences in vertical communities. We increased stickiness among young 

users by enriching communal experiences such as playing AI-powered social games and watching Tencent Video together in 

video calls. QQ’s video and image feed services, Mini World, increased its user engagement as we added hashtag feature and 

initiated trending topics that resonate with Generation Z. We launched joint promotions and celebrity eSports events for our 

popular games such as Honour of Kings and Call of Duty Mobile. We provided interactive learning experiences such as quiz 

challenges through partnering with educational institutions.

Looking  forward,  we  will  seek  to  provide  lively  chat  experiences  and  to  facilitate  users  in  sharing  content  with  broader 

communities.  We  will  enrich  interest-based  community  experiences  for  young  QQ  users,  while  delivering  a  better  social 

commerce experience within the Weixin ecosystem for consumers, SMEs and brands.

Online Games

We  strengthened  our  global  leadership  in  mobile  and  PC  games  via  self-developed  franchises  and  IP  collaboration  with 

partners and investee companies. Our leadership spans multiple genres, including MOBA, shooter and MMORPG, as well as 

multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.

Honour of Kings was the top-grossing mobile game worldwide for the second consecutive year and continued as the most 

popular mobile game in China by MAU. In January 2021, we released the biggest-ever update for Honour of Kings with a 

new  hero,  skins  and  user  interface.  We  upgraded  our  rendering  technology,  which  enhanced  visual  effects  with  minimal 

performance overhead, enabling more compelling content and game experience in future upgrades.

The launch of  Call of Duty Mobile in China drew hardcore players with a  fast-paced  and competitive  first-person-shooting 

experience, complementing Peacekeeper Elite and CrossFire Mobile within the shooter genre.

The release of Moonlight Blade Mobile demonstrated our capabilities in the MMORPG genre. Aurora Studio extended this IP 

from PC to mobile while retaining its distinctive oriental style and semi-sandbox open world design. Moonlight Blade Mobile 

ranked as the top grossing MMORPG on iOS in China during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Our  partnership  with  Nintendo  extended  our  home  entertainment  offerings  to  consoles.  By  the  end  of  2020,  we  have 

distributed over 1 million Switch consoles and published a dozen popular Switch titles in China.

5

Annual Report 2020Chairman’s StatementTo maintain a healthy gameplay environment for teenagers in China, we made ongoing upgrades to the Healthy Gameplay 

System, which aims to help parents manage younger users’ in-game play time and spending. During the fourth quarter of 

2020, minors aged under 18 accounted for 6.0% of our China online game gross receipts. Among which, minors aged under 

16 accounted for 3.2% of our China online game gross receipts.

League  of  Legends  attracted  over  45  million  peak  concurrent  viewers  for  its  2020  World  Championship  Finals,  setting  a 

record viewership for a games eSports event. The rollout of League of Legends’ mobile version, Wild Rift, further expanded its 

franchise user base.

PUBG Mobile ranked as the most popular mobile game in international markets by MAU for the second consecutive year, 

according  to  App  Annie.  The  PUBG  Mobile  Global  Championship  became  the  most  viewed  eSports  tournament  of  mobile 

games.

Digital Content

Our fee-based VAS subscriptions grew 22% year-on-year to 219 million. We are the leader in the long form video industry with 

123 million video subscriptions, benefitting from the release of popular anime IPs and drama series. We have extended our IP 

value across literature, anime, games and long form video services to create appealing content and attract paying users. We 

are also building vibrant short form video communities to encourage interaction between viewers and creators, and to deliver 

knowledge-based  video  content.  The  mini  drama  series  we  showed  on  Weishi  gained  great  popularity,  generating  billions 

of video views and social media posts. We sustained music subscription growth with the pay-for-streaming model. At China 

Literature, we have sought to enrich free and paid content, community features and an IP-centric ecosystem.

Online Advertising

We integrated our advertising platforms, strengthening our own properties as well as mobile advertising network as preferred 

choices for advertisers.

In  Weixin  Moments,  we  enabled  performance-oriented  advertisers  to  link  their  advertisements  to  Mini  Programs,  boosting 

their sales conversion. Our mobile advertising network offered customised in-app advertising solutions, ramping up in-game 

advertising revenue from third-party game companies and Internet services providers.

Looking  forward,  we  will  continue  to  strengthen  our  recommendation  algorithms  and  analytic  services  to  increase  user 

acquisition efficiency and sales conversion for advertisers.

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementFinTech

The strategic focus for our FinTech business is to work closely with regulators and collaborate with industry partners to deliver 

compliant and inclusive FinTech products, while prioritising risk management over scale.

As consumption rebounded and payment digitalisation accelerated, our payment transaction volume increased healthily year-

on-year, driven by more daily active consumers and higher payment frequency in  multiple  verticals,  such  as retail, public 

services and groceries. Our commercial take rates remained stable. For wealth management service, aggregated customer 

assets grew robustly year-on-year.

Cloud and Other Business Services

We invested in IaaS technology, including our customised “Star Lake” cloud server solutions and self-developed data centre 

technology  “T-block”,  to  enhance  our  Cloud  Services’  performance  and  cost  efficiency.  We  developed  a  new  generation 

Star Lake SA3 server powered by the latest generation AMD EPYC processors, enhancing AI, security, storage and network 

capabilities with better energy efficiency.

In the area of SaaS products, Tencent Meeting has become the largest standalone app for cloud conferencing in China. The 

recently  released  enterprise  version  of  Tencent  Meeting  penetrated  the  energy,  healthcare  and  education  industries.  We 

rolled out new conference room solutions, Tencent Meeting Rooms and Connector, which are compatible with customers’ 

existing audiovisual equipment and facilitate high-quality interactive communication. WeCom, the enterprise version of Weixin, 

has  become  an  integral  communications  tool  for  remote  workplaces,  serving  over  5.5  million  enterprise  customers,  better 

connecting them internally and to over 400 million Weixin users.

We will continue to invest in cloud computing infrastructure and technology, leverage our communication and productivity 

strengths while working with partners to upgrade our PaaS and SaaS solutions.

Annual Report 2020Chairman’s StatementEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives

Sustainability  is  vital  to  the  development  of  the  Company’s  strategy  and  operations,  and  we  strive  to  integrate  social 

responsibility into our products and services.

Environmental

We recently announced our commitment in moving towards carbon neutrality to help tackle climate change, and are exploring 

renewable energy solutions for the operation of our office buildings and data centres. We also leverage our expertise in AI, 

big  data,  and  cloud  computing  with  the  mission  of  helping  manage  sustainability  problems  for  the  planet,  such  as  smart 

agriculture solutions. TiMi Studios, the developer of Honour of Kings, has recently joined the Playing for the Planet Alliance, a 

collective effort initiated by the United Nations Environment Programme to decarbonise and integrate environmental activations 

into games.

Social

User  privacy  and  data  security  are  top  priorities  at  Tencent.  We  focus  on  user  experience  and  adhere  to  a  “privacy  by 

design” approach. We deploy advanced technologies such as data encryption, data masking, de-identification and quantum 

cryptography, to safeguard users’ data security.

We  have  upgraded  our  Balanced  Online  Entertainment  System  in  China  to  help  parents  prevent  excessive  use  of  online 

services by minors.

Tencent Health Code has facilitated domestic travel during the COVID-19 period. We also assisted enterprises to maintain 

business continuity through Weixin Pay, Mini Programs and other digital solutions.

We  have  built  Tencent  Charity  Platform  into  an  efficient  fundraising  platform,  while  also  providing  technology  for  the 

digitalisation of charitable organisations to engage with supporters. In 2020, our flagship charity event, 99 Giving Day, engaged 

over 18 million users and 10,000 charities, raising over RMB3 billion within three days. Through Weixin and QQ, we bridge the 

digital divide for the elderly and the disadvantaged. We support rural vitalisation through our WeCounty initiative, connecting 

over 16,000 villages and 2.5 million villagers.

8

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementGovernance

We  have  established  stringent  risk  management  and  internal  controls  to  maintain  the  highest  standards  in  corporate 

governance. Anti-fraud and whistleblowing policies are also in place in order to identify and prevent fraud and corruption. We 

believe diversity is key to effective governance and are dedicated to enhancing board diversity in gender, background and 

expertise.

Looking into the future, with our vision “Value for Users, Tech for Good”, we will continue to harness the power of technology in 

developing innovative products and services, and creating value for all stakeholders.

DIVIDEND

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD1.60 per share (2019: HKD1.20 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2020, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2021 AGM. Such proposed dividend will be 

payable on 7 June 2021 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 27 May 

2021.

APPRECIATION

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our wholehearted appreciation to our staff and management team for their 

remarkable contributions to the Company and their untiring dedication to accomplish our mission of “Value for Users, Tech for 

Good”. I would also like to extend our gratitude to all our shareholders and stakeholders for their unwavering support and trust 

during this challenging period. We will strive to build a sustainable ecosystem in the Consumer Internet and Industrial Internet 

sectors and create value for our users with our products and services.

Total revenues

－  Revenues  from  our  VAS  business  increased  by  32%  to  RMB264.2  billion  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Online  games 

revenues  grew  by  36%  to  RMB156.1  billion.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  revenue  growth  from  our  smart 

phone  games  in  both  domestic  and  overseas  markets,  particularly  from  titles  such  as  Peacekeeper  Elite,  Honour  of 

Kings and PUBG Mobile, as well as the full year effect of Supercell consolidation, while our PC client games revenues 

decreased slightly. Total smart phone games revenues (including smart phone games revenues attributable to our social 

networks business) were RMB146.6 billion and PC client games revenues were RMB44.6 billion for the year ended 31 

December 2020. Social networks revenues increased by 27% to RMB108.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to 

the consolidation of HUYA’s live broadcast services, revenue growth from our music and video subscription services, as 

well as growth from our in-game virtual item sales.

－  Revenues  from  our  Online  Advertising  business  increased  by  20%  to  RMB82.3  billion  on  a  year-on-year  basis, 

benefitting from our platform integration and upgraded algorithms, along with rising demand from advertiser categories 

such as education, Internet services and eCommerce platforms. Social and others advertising revenues grew by 29% 

to  RMB68.0  billion.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  higher  advertising  revenues  from  Weixin  (primarily  Weixin 

Moments) as a result of its increased inventories, as well as revenue contributions from our mobile advertising network 

due to our video format advertisements. Media advertising revenues decreased by 8% to RMB14.3 billion. The decrease 

mainly reflected lower advertising revenues from Tencent Video amid the challenging macro environment and delays to 

content productions and launches, partly offset by advertising revenue growth from our music streaming apps.

－  Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 26% to RMB128.1 billion on a year-on-year basis. The 

increase primarily reflected higher revenues from commercial payment, wealth management and Cloud Services, driven 

by our expanded user base and business scale.

11

Annual Report 2020Management Discussion and AnalysisCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 24% to RMB260.5 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020 on a year-

on-year basis. The increase was mainly due to greater channel and distribution costs, server and bandwidth costs, as well as 

transaction costs of FinTech services. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 54% for the year ended 31 

December 2020 from 56% for the year ended 31 December 2019. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of

Total cost of revenues

－ 

Cost of revenues for VAS increased by 29% to RMB121.3 billion. The increase was mainly driven by greater content 

costs  for  live  broadcast  and  video  subscription  services,  as  well  as  costs  for  smart  phone  games,  including  those 

associated with the consolidations of Supercell and HUYA.

－ 

Cost of revenues for Online Advertising increased by 15% year-on-year to RMB40.0 billion. The increase was mainly 

due to greater traffic acquisition, server and bandwidth costs, partly offset by lower content costs associated with variety 

shows and sports events.

－ 

Cost of revenues for FinTech and Business Services increased by 24% year-on-year to RMB91.8 billion. The increase 

primarily reflected greater transaction costs resulting from TPV growth, as well as higher server and bandwidth costs due 

to expansion of our Cloud Services business.

Other gains, net. We recorded net other gains of RMB57.1 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020, which were primarily 

non-IFRS adjustment items including net fair value gains arising from increased valuations for certain investee companies 

in verticals such as social media, online games, electric vehicles and eCommerce, as well as net gains on deemed disposals 

arising from the capital activities of certain investee companies in the eCommerce and online games verticals, partly offset by 

impairment provisions reflecting revised valuations of certain investee companies.

12

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and AnalysisSelling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 58% to RMB33.8 billion for the year ended 31 

December 2020 on a year-on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected greater marketing spending for online games and 

the impact of recent consolidations, as well as marketing to support long-term strategic initiatives including short-form video, 

cloud-based  healthcare  solutions,  online  education  and  remote  work.  As  a  percentage  of  revenues,  selling  and  marketing 

expenses increased to 7% for the year ended 31 December 2020 from 6% for the year ended 31 December 2019.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 27% to RMB67.6 billion for the year 

ended 31 December 2020 on a year-on-year basis. The increase was primarily driven by greater  R&D expenses and staff 

costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 14% for the year ended 31 December 2020, 

broadly stable year-on-year.

Finance costs, net. Net finance costs increased by 4% to RMB7.9 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020 on a year-on-

year basis. The increase primarily reflected foreign exchange losses recognised this year compared to gains for previous year, 

partially offset by lower interest expenses resulting from reduced average cost of funds.

Share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures. We recorded share of profit of associates and joint ventures of RMB3.7 

billion for the year ended 31 December 2020, compared to share of losses of RMB1.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 

2019. The change was substantially due to non-IFRS adjustment items of certain associates and improved performance of 

certain associates in verticals such as eCommerce.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 47% to RMB19.9 billion on a year-on-year basis. The increase was 

mainly driven by higher taxable income.

Total revenues

－  Revenues from VAS increased by 28% to RMB67.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis. Online 

games revenues grew by 29% to RMB39.1 billion, among which our international games revenues were RMB9.8 billion, 

increased by 43% on a year-on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected revenue contributions from our smart phone 

games  including  Peacekeeper  Elite,  Honour  of  Kings,  PUBG  Mobile  and  recently  launched  titles  such  as  Moonlight 

Blade  Mobile.  Total  smart  phone  games  revenues  (including  smart  phone  games  revenues  attributable  to  our  social 

networks business) were RMB36.7 billion and PC client games revenues were RMB10.2 billion for the fourth quarter 

of 2020. Social networks revenues increased by 27% to RMB27.9 billion. The increase was mainly driven by revenue 

growth from digital content services including the consolidation impact of HUYA’s live broadcast services, our music and 

video subscription services, as well as from in-game virtual item sales.

－  Revenues from Online Advertising increased by 22% to RMB24.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of 

rising demand from advertiser categories such as education, eCommerce platforms and fast-moving consumer goods, as 

well as consolidation of Bitauto’s advertising revenue. Social and others advertising revenues grew by 25% to RMB20.4 

billion. The increase primarily reflected more advertiser demand for Weixin Moments inventory, and for customised in-

app advertising solutions offered by our mobile advertising network. Media  advertising revenues  increased  by  8%  to 

RMB4.3 billion. The increase was mainly driven by our music streaming apps, as well as contributions from Tencent 

Video due to airing of popular drama series.

－  Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 29% to RMB38.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 

on  a  year-on-year  basis.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  revenue  growth  from  commercial  payment  and  wealth 

management services resulting from increased volume of transactions and value per transaction. Our Business Services 

revenues experienced robust year-on-year growth as we deepened our market presence in verticals such as municipal 

services, financial services and Internet services, and as we began to consolidate Bitauto’s Business Services revenue 

during the fourth quarter of 2020.

15

Annual Report 2020Management Discussion and AnalysisCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 25% to RMB74.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year 

basis. The increase was mainly driven by greater channel and distribution costs, content costs, as well as transaction costs 

of FinTech services. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 56% for the fourth quarter of 2020, broadly stable 

compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of business for the fourth 

quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019:

Total cost of revenues

－ 

Cost of revenues for VAS increased by 24% to RMB32.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis. 

The increase mainly reflected greater content costs for digital content services including the consolidation impact of 

HUYA’s live broadcast services, as well as costs for smart phone games arising from revenue growth.

－ 

Cost of revenues for Online Advertising increased by 25% to RMB11.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-

year basis. The increase was mainly driven by greater traffic acquisition costs associated with revenue growth from our 

mobile advertising network, as well as greater server and bandwidth costs.

－ 

Cost  of  revenues  for  FinTech  and  Business  Services  increased  by  28%  to  RMB27.5  billion  for  the  fourth  quarter  of 

2020 on a year-on-year basis. The increase was primarily due to greater transaction costs as TPV grew, and increased 

spending on servers and bandwidth to support enlarged scale of our Cloud Services business.

16

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and AnalysisOther gains, net. We recorded net other gains of RMB32.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, which were mainly non-IFRS 

adjustment items including net fair value gains due to increased valuations of investee companies in verticals such as social 

media, eCommerce and online games, as well as net gains on deemed disposals of certain investee companies, partly offset by 

impairment provisions against certain investee companies.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 49% to RMB10.0 billion for the fourth quarter 

of  2020  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  greater  marketing  spending  on  online  games,  Business 

Services, and digital content services, including those associated with the consolidation of Bitauto and HUYA. As a percentage 

of revenues, selling and marketing expenses increased to 8% for the fourth quarter of 2020 from 6% for the fourth quarter of 

2019.

General and administrative expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  24%  to  RMB19.8  billion  for  the 

fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected greater R&D expenses and staff costs. As 

a  percentage  of  revenues,  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  15%  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  broadly  stable 

compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Finance costs, net. Net finance costs decreased by 19% to RMB2.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year 

basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expenses as a result of reduced average cost of funds.

Share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures. We recorded share of profit of associates and joint ventures of RMB1.6 

billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to share of losses of RMB1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019. The change 

was partly driven by non-IFRS adjustment items of certain associates in eCommerce, and partly due to improved performance 

of certain investee companies in verticals such as eCommerce and online games.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 74% to RMB3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year 

basis.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 175% 

to RMB59.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis. Non-IFRS profit attributable to equity holders of the 

Company increased by 30% to RMB33.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and AnalysisRevenues. Revenues increased by 7% to RMB133.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

－  Revenues from VAS decreased by 4% to RMB67.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. Online games revenues reduced 

by 6% to RMB39.1 billion. The sequential decline was mainly driven by lower revenues from domestic smart phone 

games and PC client games due to normalised user activities and seasonality, partly offset by revenue contributions from 

newly launched titles including Moonlight Blade Mobile. Social networks revenues decreased by 2% to RMB27.9 billion. 

The decrease mainly reflected revenue decline from in-game virtual item sales, partly offset by revenue growth from 

digital content services including live broadcast services.

－  Revenues from Online Advertising increased by 15% to RMB24.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. Social and others 

advertising revenues grew by 15% to RMB20.4 billion. The increase mainly reflected revenue growth from our mobile 

advertising network and Weixin Moments, resulting from positive seasonality of eCommerce marketing efforts, as well as 

the consolidation of Bitauto’s advertising revenue. Media advertising revenues increased by 19% to RMB4.3 billion. The 

increase was primarily driven by greater video advertising revenues due to the popularity of certain drama series released 

in the fourth quarter, as well as advertising revenues from music streaming apps.

－  Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 16% to RMB38.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. The 

increase was mainly driven by higher revenues from Cloud Services business due to deployment of more on-premise 

projects  during  the  fourth  quarter,  particularly  in  the  municipal  and  healthcare  sectors,  as  well  as  consolidation  of 

Bitauto’s Business Services revenue. Revenues from payment related services also contributed to the sequential growth, 

as both online and offline TPV grew in sectors such as eCommerce, retail and municipal services.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 9% to RMB74.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 on quarter-on-quarter 

basis. The increase was mainly driven by greater content costs, transaction costs of FinTech services, and Cloud Services 

project deployment costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 56% for the fourth quarter of 2020 from 

55% for the third quarter of 2020.

－ 

Cost  of  revenues  for  VAS  decreased  by  2%  to  RMB32.5  billion  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020.  The  decrease  mainly 

reflected lower content costs for video subscription services as a result of airing fewer sports events and lower costs for 

smart phone games, partly offset by increased content costs for live broadcast services and eSports events.

－ 

－ 

Cost of revenues for Online Advertising increased by 10% to RMB11.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase 

was primarily driven by greater traffic acquisition costs due to revenue growth from our advertising network.

Cost of revenues for FinTech and Business Services increased by 15% to RMB27.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. 

The increase was mainly due to greater transaction costs for payment-related services, and higher Cloud Services project 

deployment costs.

Business Services, and the consolidation of Bitauto.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 15% to RMB19.8 billion for the fourth 

quarter of 2020 on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The increase mainly reflected greater R&D expenses and staff costs.

NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-IFRS financial 

measures (in terms of operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, net margin, profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS) have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-IFRS financial 

measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared 

in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-IFRS financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by 

other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-IFRS  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  Group’s  core  operations  by  excluding  certain  non-cash  items  and  certain 

impact of M&A transactions. In addition, non-IFRS adjustments include relevant non-IFRS adjustments for the Group’s major 

associates  based  on  available  published  financials  of  the  relevant  major  associates,  or  estimates  made  by  the  Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

Changes  in  respective  items  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  have  been  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the 

consolidated financial information in this annual report.

We  manage  our  investment  portfolio  with  a  primary  objective  to  strengthen  our  leading  position  in  core  businesses  and

sectors. We also invest in transportation, FinTech, cloud and other sectors.

The fair value of our stakes in listed investee companies (excluding subsidiaries) amounted to RMB1,204,931 million as at 31 

December 2020 (31 December 2019: RMB419,818 million).

As at 31 December 2020, we were interested in approximately 250 million shares with a value of approximately RMB81.6 

billion in Snap Inc., a company operating a social media platform, representing approximately 17% of its total outstanding 

shares, which accounted for approximately 6% of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2020. The cost of our investment 

was approximately RMB20.4 billion. This investment is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. During 

the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group did not receive any dividends from Snap Inc., and there were realised gains of 

approximately RMB243 million from partial disposal and unrealised gains of approximately RMB56.8 billion from changes in 

fair value under equity. The Group does not have nor does it exercise any managerial influence in Snap Inc. and regards this 

as a passive investment. Except Snap Inc., there was no other individual investment with a carrying value of 5% or more of the 

Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2020.

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and AnalysisAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had net cash of RMB11.1 billion, compared to  net cash  of RMB6.4 billion as at  30 

September 2020. The sequential improvement was mainly due to free cash flow  generation and foreign exchange effects, 

partly offset by a net cash outflow for M&A activities.

For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Group had free cash flow of RMB27.7 billion. This was a result of net cash flow generated 

from operating activities of RMB48.9 billion, offset by payments for capital expenditures of RMB12.3 billion, payments for 

media content of RMB7.7 billion, and payments for lease liabilities of RMB1.2 billion.

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ Report5. 

The closing price immediately before the date on which the options were granted on 12 June 2020, 15 August 2020, 15 October 2020 

and 15 December 2020 was USD6.2 per share, USD7.2 per share, USD7.15 per share and USD9.44 per share, respectively.

6. 

The weighted average closing price immediately before the date on which the options were exercised was USD7.25 per share.

7. 

The fair value of the options as at the respective grant date was determined using the “Enhanced FAS 123” binomial model which is to 

be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 

2020 was USD2.7 per share. Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant assumptions (which are subject to subjectivity 

and uncertainty) used to estimate the fair value of the options include risk free rate (0.71% – 0.91%), dividend yield (nil) and expected 

volatility* (40% – 42.5%).

* 

The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the share prices of similar United States and Hong Kong public companies 

for a period equal to the expected life preceding the grant date.

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportCONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with  the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by themselves or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History 

and Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group 

is able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts 

are also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to 

acquire the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2020, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has 

been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been removed.

61

Annual Report 2020Directors’ ReportRequirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2020

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening  the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games  and  the Examination and Approval of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定” 規定》和中央編辦有關解釋，進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進口

網絡遊戲審批管理的通知)  (the  “Circular  13”)  jointly  issued  by  PRC  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication,  the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly-

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

However, the Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between 

foreign online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether 

the  State  General  Administration  of  Press,  Publication,  Radio,  Film  and  Television  will  deem  the  Group’s  structure  and 

operations to be in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through OPCOs that hold the 

necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to Structure Contracts will be adopted or if adopted, 

what they  would provide. On 15 March 2019, the Standing Committee of National People’s Congress promulgated  Law  of 

Foreign Investment which became effective on 1 January 2020 (the “2019 Law of Foreign Investment”). While the 2019 Law of 

Foreign Investment does not define Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment explicitly, the Company cannot assure 

that future laws and regulations will not provide for Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be 

no assurance that the Company’s control over OPCOs through Structure Contracts will not be deemed as foreign investment in 

the future. If the Structure Contracts were to be deemed as a method of foreign investment under any future laws, regulations 

and rules, and if any of the Company’s business operations were to fall under the “negative list” for foreign investment, the 

Company would need to take further actions in order to comply with these laws, regulations and rules, which may materially 

and adversely affect its current corporate structure, business, financial condition and results of operations.

carried  out  during  the  financial  year  had  been  entered  into  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Structure 

Contracts and, had been operated so as to transfer by the date of this annual report Tencent Computer’s and Shiji Kaixuan’s

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportThe risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due to the legal constraints in relation to foreign investment in the telecommunications value-added services industry in the 

PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the WFOEs 

derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these intra-

group contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and adverse 

impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the tax 

treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

71

Annual Report 2020Directors’ ReportMaintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  are  based  on  the  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code.  The  Board 

believes that throughout the year ended 31 December 2020, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the roles of the chairman 

and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes 

when appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates  the  Company’s overall business strategy  and  monitors  management’s 

execution of such strategy.

The Board has defined the business and governance issues for which it needs to be responsible for, and these matters are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this 

regard, the Board:

• 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;

• 

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;

• 

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual business plan and budget;

72

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report• 

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned;

• 

approves the Company’s financial statements and interim and annual reports;

• 

determines the Group’s communication policy;

• 

determines director selection, orientation and evaluation;

• 

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control,  internal  audit  and  regulatory  compliance 

procedures in place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders;

• 

establishes Board committees with clear terms of reference and responsibilities as appropriate;

• 

defines levels of delegation in respect of specific matters, with required authority to Board committees and management;

• 

monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the businesses of the Group;

• 

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders; and

• 

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness.

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long-term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

73

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportThe Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

• 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor;

• 

reviews the Company’s financial information;

• 

exercises oversight of the Company’s financial reporting system;

• 

reviews the work done by the Company’s management with respect to risk management and internal control systems;

Remuneration Committee

• 

reviews and approves proposals about the policy and structure of remuneration of directors and senior management 

team;

• 

ensures that no director or any of his associates is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

The major work of these committees during the year 2020 is set out on pages 82 to 88.

75

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportAll directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring that Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe  education and training are important for maintaining an effective Board.  New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2020, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The table below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2020:

76

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportA high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot be maintained only with the Board’s efforts. Each of the Group’s 

employees plays a role in contributing to such cause. A code of conduct which emphasises integrity and respect is distributed 

by the Company to all employees and it forms part of the employment agreement with each of the employees.

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

• 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

• 

training has been and will continue to be provided to the directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on 

any updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

• 

the  company  secretary  who  is  an  employee  of  the  Company  attends  training  in  compliance  with  the  Listing  Rules 

requirements; and

• 

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in order to promote the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the roles of the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

77

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportBesides,  all  major  decisions  have  been  made  in  consultation  with  members  of  the  Board  and  appropriate  committees,  as 

well as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to 

time to make presentations and answer the Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in 

all Board and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly 

briefed at the Board meetings, and he works with the senior management team to provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete 

and reliable information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is 

available for discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Chairman held a 

meeting with the independent non-executive directors without the presence of other directors as required by the Listing Rules.

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and make necessary 

changes when appropriate.

Composition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of nine directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors and five independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2020 and up to the date of this 

annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 51 to 54 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A  of the  Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

78

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in a professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings  and  bring  professional  judgment  and  advice  on  issues  relating  to  the  Group’s  strategies,  policies,  performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. The non-executive directors also take the lead where potential 

conflicts  of  interests  arise  and  exercise  their  professional  judgment  and  utilise  their  expertise  to  scrutinise  the  Company’s 

performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor performance reporting.

Further,  in  compliance  with  Rule  3.10  of  the  Listing  Rules,  two  of  our  independent  non-executive  directors  have  the 

appropriate professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice 

from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation 

annually  of  their  independence  and  the  Nomination  Committee  has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all 

independent non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 

of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

79

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportAppointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2020 annual general meeting, Messrs Lau Chi Ping Martin and Charles St Leger Searle retired and were re-elected, and 

Professor Ke Yang was re-elected in accordance with Article 86(3) of the Articles of Association.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, there is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and 

development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to the sustainable development of the Group. Given 

the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

As the re-election of Mr Yang Siu Shun, who was re-elected in 2017, was not considered at the 2020 annual general meeting, 

there is a deviation from code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. Considering that the re-election of Mr Yang Siu Shun will be 

considered at the 2021 AGM, the Board believes that such deviation from code provision A.4.2 of CG Code does not have a 

material impact on the operation of the Company as a whole.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial and 

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  company  secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the 

Board meeting to each of the directors at least 14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary 

also sends the agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in 

advance of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial 

performance and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as 

promptly and fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, 

such director will declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 

senior management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 

expense in appropriate circumstances.

independent non-executive directors and considers all of them to be independent, taking into account of the independence 

guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive 

director, and the perspectives, skills and experience that such director can bring to the Board. The Company recognises the 

benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a business imperative that will help the Company 

achieve its strategic objectives and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, the Board has set measurable objectives for 

the implementation of the board diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience and 

diversity of perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business strategy and maintain the effectiveness of the 

Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy are successfully 

implemented  with  reference  to  the  measurable  objectives.  The  Nomination  Committee  will  continue  to  conduct  periodic 

review and monitor the implementation of the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy to ensure their continued 

effectiveness.

Purpose and Objectives

The board diversity policy aims to set out the approach to enable the Nomination Committee to 

achieve diversity on the Board.

Policy Statement

The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board 

level as a business imperative that will help the Company achieve its strategic objectives and 

maintain a competitive advantage. A truly diverse Board will be achieved through a number of 

factors, including but not limited to differences in skills, knowledge, experience and background.

Measurable Objectives

Board  appointments  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  merit  and  fairness,  with  due  regard  to  the 

benefits  of  diversity  on  the  Board.  The  Nomination  Committee  will  continue  to  have  primary 

responsibility for identifying suitably qualified candidates to become members of the Board and,

87

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportRemuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong Sheng 

(both  are  independent  non-executive  directors)  and  Mr  Jacobus  Petrus  (Koos)  Bekker  (non-executive  director).  The 

Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Ian Charles Stone.

The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2020. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is set 

out on page 81.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration package of each director.

The Remuneration Committee’s major work during the year 2020 includes the following:

• 

reviewing and recommending to the Board in respect of the remuneration policies and structure of the Company by 

benchmarking peer companies with a similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages are competitive 

to recruit the best talents in the industry and to retain key staff;

• 

reviewing and recommending to the Board on the remuneration packages for the directors;

• 

assessing performance and, reviewing and approving adjustments to the remuneration packages for the members of the 

senior management team; and

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned 

with the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate 

high  performing  individuals,  and  reflect  the  specifics  of  individual  roles.  For  further  details  of  emoluments  of  the  senior 

management by band, please refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

the particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

88

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibilities, the Board ensures that the assessment over the Group’s performance and prospects 

are  clearly  and  comprehensively  presented.  The  directors  acknowledge  that  it  is  their  ultimate  responsibility  to  prepare 

the  accounts  which  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  financial  position  of  the  Group  on  a  going-concern  basis  and  other 

announcements  and  financial  disclosures.  To  assist  the  Board  in  discharging  their  responsibilities,  management  provides 

updates  to  the  Board  from  time  to  time,  including  the  Group’s  detailed  business  and  financial  position,  in  order  to  give 

the directors a balanced, understandable and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects  of the  Group. 

Management also provides all necessary and relevant information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and 

information they need to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information 

put before them for approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the 

“Independent Auditor’s Report” of this annual report.

Adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s strategic objectives. Risk management and internal control systems shall ensure the effective business operation, 

accuracy and reliability of the financial reporting, as well as the compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies.

The Board acknowledges that it is their responsibility to ensure that the Company has established and maintained adequate 

and effective risk management and internal control systems. The Board delegates their responsibility to the Audit Committee 

to  review  the  practices  of  management  with  respect  to  risk  management  and  internal  control,  including  the  design, 

implementation  and  supervision  of  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  Audit 

Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems on an annual basis. The Board 

is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the Company’s acceptable level of risk, 

and proactively considering, analysing and formulating strategies to manage the Company’s significant risks.

Under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  Board,  the  Company  has  adopted  a  risk  management  and  internal  control 

structure, referred to as the “Three Lines of Defence” model, to ensure the effectiveness of its risk management and internal 

control systems.

First Line of Defence – Operation and Management

Our First Line of Defence is mainly comprised of business and functional departments of each business group of the Company 

who  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operation  and  management.  They  are  responsible  for  designing  and  implementing 

controls to address the risks.

89

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportSecond Line of Defence – Risk Management

Our Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. They are responsible for formulating policies related to the risk management 

and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk control systems. 

To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  such  systems,  they  also  assist  and  supervise  the  first  line  of  defence  in  the 

establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

Third Line of Defence – Independent Assurance

Our Third Line of Defence is comprised of the IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing an independent evaluation on the effectiveness 

of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems, and monitoring management’s continuous improvement over 

the risk management and internal controls.

The  Anti-fraud  Investigation  Department  is  responsible  for  receiving  whistleblower  reports  through  various  channels  and 

following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the  “Tencent Sunshine 

Code of Conduct” (the “Sunshine Code”) and the value of integrity to all employees of the Company.

The IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department have direct reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

The Three Lines of Defence model of the risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than 

eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 

material misstatement or loss.

The Board and management have always placed importance on the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 

In  2020,  the  Company  has  invested  more  resources  in  the  continuous  improvement  of  the  risk  management  and  internal 

control  systems,  which  have  also  continuously  increased  the  awareness  of  risk  management  among  the  employees.  The 

internal control function has continuously worked closely with and provided proactive support to the business groups in their 

business development and risk management. Furthermore, the IA has also continued to promote the deployment of various 

internal audit projects and continuous audits to provide more effective and timelier independent evaluations. The Anti-fraud 

Investigation Department further strengthened the values of integrity among the employees, followed up and investigated the 

alleged fraudulent activities. The connection and interaction among the three lines of defence have been further enhanced to 

provide more effective support to the Company’s development.

90

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportRisk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving its risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

and its risk management ability, to ensure long-term growth and sustainable development of the Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” internal monitoring model 

as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party in the system as well as the relevant 

risk management policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses 

any risks that may negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The 

Company also provides risk management and internal control training for staff on a regular basis.

Risk Management Process

Being an Internet and technology company with a wide variety of rapidly-changing businesses, the Company has adopted the 

following dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

• 

Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

• 

The  IC  collects,  analyses  and  consolidates  a  list  of  significant  risks  at  the  business  level,  and  provides  input  on  risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses and control measures  will  be reviewed by management  and subsequently by  the Audit Committee before 

reporting to the Board;

• 

The IC analyses and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

• 

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with support from the IC.

91

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportSignificant Risks of the Company

As  the  Company’s  business  scale,  scope  and  complexity  have  evolved,  so  as  its  external  environment,  management 

considers that the Company is still facing the nine significant risks disclosed in 2019 through the risk management process 

detailed  above.  “Regulatory  and  Compliance  Risk”,  “Market  Competition  and  Innovation  Risk”,  “Social  Responsibility  and 

Environmental Sustainability Risk” and “M&A and Investment Management Risk” have been increased while the other risks 

remain at the similar level as last year.

On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee supervises the overall risk status of the Company and assesses the change in 

the nature and severity of the Company’s major risks. The Audit Committee considers that management has taken appropriate 

measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a level acceptable to the Board.

Below is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk 

profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

1.  Regulatory and compliance risk

The  Internet  and  technology  industry  is  still  evolving  yet  getting  more  mature.  In  an  attempt  to  keep  up  with  such 

evolution, regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions have been heightening respective regulatory requirements. As 

the Company continuously expands its businesses in the PRC and overseas to more countries and jurisdictions, it is 

required to keep up and comply with the relevant applicable laws and regulations in different countries and jurisdictions, 

including but not limited to laws relating to privacy and data protection, IP, telecommunications and Internet, gaming, 

Internet  finance,  labour  protection,  foreign  investment,  international  trade,  antitrust,  etc.  In  addition,  development 

of  various  industries  around  the  world  may  be  impacted  by  regulatory  uncertainties  in  different  jurisdictions  and 

uncertainties in international relations.

The Company has invested enormous compliance resources and efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 

regulatory requirements. This includes setting up special departments and specialist teams, as well as engaging external 

professional consultants to work closely with management to track on changes in relevant laws and regulations; and take 

appropriate responding actions or measures to ensure the Company is in compliance with such applicable laws and 

regulations. In addition, the Company also engages in active dialogue with relevant regulatory authorities, and exchanges 

view  and  information  with  relevant  regulatory  authorities  on  the  market  trends  and  the  development  of  Internet  and 

technology industry.

92

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report2.  Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet and technology industry is highly competitive, innovative and ever-changing at all times. The development 

of technologies brings evolutional changes to the existing business models; and the cross-sectoral expansion of non-

Internet  and  technology  companies  bring  in  more  new  players  into  the  market.  Users’  expectations  for  innovative 

products and services are also increasing. Therefore, how to attract new  users and stay  competitive  are still the key 

challenges of the Company. Any lagging in innovation and development of technology and product would impair the core 

competitiveness of the Company.

The Company stays on top of trends in market and industry development, as well as user needs, keeps up with the 

technological development through innovation in frontier technology and  explores application of technologies  in  new 

scenarios. Internally, the Company stays focused on expectation changes in user experience, stays active in promoting 

the incubation of new business, keeps exploring new forms of business, and recruits talent, optimises its organisational 

structure,  and  enhances  the  innovation  capabilities  by  improving  talent  quality  with  cultivating  young  talent.  The 

Company  also  continuously  enhances  its  technical  capabilities  and  innovation  environment  to  develop  products  that 

meet  the  expectations  of  the  market.  Externally,  the  Company  co-creates  ecosystems  through  strategic  investments 

and M&A, as well as collaboration with business partners. As always, the Company leverages the strength of the new 

ecosystems to seek new business partners to explore new business opportunities and better approach to responding to 

the market needs and expectations. With the aim to promote “mutual benefit and win-win” concept, the Company has 

established a number of open platforms to incubate potential startup companies, and enhance its collaboration with 

business partners and its competitiveness in the market.

3. 

Information security risk

Protecting  user  and  customer  data  is  the  top  priority  of  the  Company.  The  Company  continues  to  pay  attention  to 

regulatory requirements for privacy and data protection in various jurisdictions and is fully aware that any loss or leakage 

of such information could have a significant negative impact on the affected users and customers and the Company’s 

reputation. This could in turn lead to potential legal actions against the Company.

The Company strongly believes that protecting user and customer data is the key prerequisite for delivering secured 

and high-quality products and user experience. With a strong commitment to protecting data privacy and security, the 

Company strictly complies with applicable laws and regulations, and strives to provide the highest level of protection on 

such information and data. In this regard, the Company has formulated and kept optimising control measures to protect 

such information and data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, encryption, access 

restrictions and controls, and the establishment of appropriate and effective management processes, and continuously 

improving the business continuity and disaster recovery management. In addition, the Company arranges regular reviews 

by independent specialists over the Company’s data protection practices; and provides training for staff to enhance their 

awareness of information security.

93

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance Report4.  ToB business risk

The Company has actively developed various ToB businesses related to Industrial Internet. With the rapid development 

of the ToB business, if the Company fails to adjust its business strategy to respond to changes in industry trends and 

market needs on a timely basis, to keep optimising its organisational structure with support from professional talent, to 

improve its internal management system and processes for ToB business, to enhance its supply chain management 

capabilities; and to improve its cooperation mechanisms with various business partners, it may affect the development of 

its ToB business and affect the achievement of its strategic objectives.

The  Company  is  accumulating  and  solidifying  its  experience  in  the  ToB  business,  it  does  so  by  analyzing  trends  in 

different industries and changes in user needs. The Company has started to increase its footprints in the ToB business by 

integrating cloud computing, AI, Internet of Things, security and other advanced technologies for deployments in various 

industry-specific scenarios, to build a new, intelligent ecosystem that efficiently connects customers and enterprises. 

This has been applied across many industries including financial services, retail, social services, tourism, healthcare, 

industry, transport, energy, radio & television, education, etc. Furthermore, the Company is continuously developing its 

ToB business, optimising its management over business structure, human resources, management policies and business

5.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high-quality user experience. Any material 

functional  defect,  interruption,  breakdown  or  other  issue  in  connection  is  likely  to  adversely  impact  the  Company’s 

businesses. In addition, the Company’s operations may be negatively affected or disrupted by the natural disasters, social 

security events, or epidemic diseases. Relevant incidents may damage workplaces and equipment that are vital to the 

Company and its business partners, and threaten the health of their employees.

94

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  Company  has  been  continuously  investing  in  the  network  infrastructure  to  enhance  its  business  recovery  and 

continued  capabilities  for  providing  stable  support  to  the  business  operations  and  development.  Various  business 

departments are also engaged in business continuity management to ensure the smooth operation of the Company’s 

business. In addition, the Company has established dedicated teams to develop business contingency plans and has 

performed periodic drills on the plans to ensure their effectiveness. The dedicated teams have also reviewed the plans as 

well as the result of the drills. In the post-pandemic era, the Company’s emergency response team continues to operate 

effectively, closely monitoring risks, keeping up with policy changes, and responding to both risks and policy changes 

in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner.  For  example,  the  Company  provides  mobile  working  solution  plan  and  various 

functional support, to support the business group in responding to urgent needs through adjusting resource allocation 

and timely deployment of emergency measures to ensure employee safety and continued operations of the Company’s 

business. The Company also performs emergency drills to improve business’s capabilities in responding to emergencies. 

Meanwhile,  the  Company  will  also  work  closely  with  partners  to  seek  solutions  to  application  scenarios  during  these 

special periods, and to jointly build an open, innovative and secured digital ecosystem to support the economic recovery 

and business development in the post-pandemic era.

6.  Crisis management, public relations and reputation risk

As one of the China’s largest Internet and technology companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses, products and 

investments, users and business partners, as well as increasingly complex business forms, the Company always attracts 

very high attention from the public and media. The Company needs to consider possible crisis and actively respond to 

them, to avoid worsening of problems or escalation of crisis. The Company also needs to disclose comprehensive and 

proper information to the public; otherwise, it may damage the Company’s reputation, brand and image, and adversely 

affect the business and prospects of the Company.

In  adherence  to  the  principles  of  openness  and  transparency,  the  Company  has  communicated  with  the  public 

in  a  timely  manner  and  disclosed  comprehensive  and  proper  information.  In  response  to  crisis,  the  Company  has 

established the corresponding emergency response mechanism, to follow up on the progression of crisis, assess risks, 

make prompt decisions and adjust its businesses to reduce the impact. The Company has set up professional public 

relations  department  and  teams  for  crisis  management  to  continuously  improve  its  crisis  management  and  public 

relations capabilities, with established emergency response and public relations management mechanisms. The crisis 

management teams have maintained close interaction with management and business groups, to continuously gather 

public  opinions,  analyse  relevant  market  information  for  management  to  enable  management  timely  respond  and 

disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public according to the Company’s policies and procedures; and 

protect the Company’s reputation.

95

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance Report7.  Social responsibility and environmental sustainability risk

The  Company  upholds  its  vision  and  mission  of  “Value  for  Users,  Tech  for  Good”  by  embracing  the  philosophy  of 

sustainable  development.  The  Company  is  always  committed  to  social  responsibility  and  promoting  environmental 

sustainability using Internet and other technologies.

The  Company  helps  facilitate  the  upgrade  and  transformation  of  various  industries  including  healthcare,  education, 

travel, tourism, etc. and builds new forms of employment, creating value for both enterprises and customers by drawing 

on its core competencies in the fields of Internet, technology and communication. With the leverage of digital technology, 

the Company strives to revitalize China’s rural areas and bridge the urban-rural digital divide to better promote shared 

development of the society.

As China’s first Internet and technology enterprise with a charity foundation, the Company established and operates the 

Tencent Charity Platform and commits itself to improve the digital capabilities of the charitable sector. In response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have established a RMB1.5 billion China Anti-Pandemic Fund and a USD100 million Global 

Anti-Pandemic Fund to support efforts against the pandemic.

The  “Xplore  Prize”  is  initiated  by  the  Company  together  with  several  renowned  scientists  to  actively  encourage  the 

study of key technologies and basic science among young scientists. In respect of protection of juveniles, the “Parental 

Guardian Platform” and “Healthy Gameplay System” were established to prevent unhealthy gaming habits of juveniles by 

enhancing the screening of suspected underaged users. Meanwhile, the Company continues to put efforts in promoting

The Company is committed to promoting environmental sustainability and places environmental protection as one of its

Company also provides a variety of products and services (such as Tencent Cloud, WeCom, Tencent Meeting, etc.) to 

help its business partners carry out digital transformation and to promote a shift towards low-carbon, green and circular 

economy.

8.  M&A and investment management risk

The  Company  has  a  certain  scale  of  investment  activities  in  diverse  fields.  It  is  important  for  the  Company  to  adopt 

robust procedures in the formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment 

evaluation stage as well as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly manage investment risks could hinder the 

realization of investment strategies and lead to probable financial loss of the Company.

96

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously,  and  has,  amongst  other  things,  established  an 

Investment Committee under the Board, dedicated an investment team to identify investment opportunities, appointed 

finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  manage  relevant  risks  and  put  in  place  the  investment  risk 

evaluation and approval process. The Company has also designated finance, legal and other relevant professional teams 

to support and monitor the performance of the investee companies. These teams periodically analyse and review relevant 

operating  and financial information of  the  investee companies  to ensure that they continue to satisfy  the Company’s 

investment strategies. In addition, the Company has invested resources in IA and IC to empower investee companies, 

and to continuously support the management of its controlling subsidiaries in establishing more sound risk management 

and internal control systems.

9.  Fraud risk

In  recent  years,  fraudulent  activities  have  occurred  frequently  in  the  Internet  and  technology  industry  and  therefore 

integrity  has been an important concern. As the Company continues developing its business, its business  scale  and 

complexity increased, and consequently the fraud risk inevitably increased to a certain extent. For example, fraudulent 

activities  caused  by  collusion  between  suppliers/business  partners  and  employees  can  have  a  negative  impact  on 

reputation and financial position of the Company.

The Company, with its belief in the value of integrity, has zero tolerance for fraud, and is determined to fight against 

any fraudulent activities. The Company has established effective internal control systems and is continuously improving 

it. These systems have been strengthened by systematic, transparent control measures and procedures. To enhance 

and promote integrity, the Company continuously conducts various training for its employees, suppliers and business 

partners.  For  employees,  the  Company  has  established  the  Sunshine  Code  that  the  employees  shall  strictly  follow 

during their employment and in the course of business dealing with suppliers and business partners. For suppliers and 

business partners, the Company cooperates with them to create an ecosystem with integrity. The Company has signed 

an Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration with its suppliers and business partners to alert the counterparts the importance 

of ethical value and to build a healthy and transparent environment for business. Furthermore, the Company has set up 

an Anti-fraud Investigation Department for years to proactively collect whistleblowing cases from various channels, and 

to follow up and investigate alleged fraudulent cases on a timely basis. The Company will terminate the employment 

immediately with any employee who has been found to be involved in any fraudulent activities. The Company may also 

pass the relevant case to initiate legal proceeding according to the relevant laws and regulations under more serious 

circumstances. Any supplier/business partner found to be involved in any fraudulent activities will be blacklisted and 

deprived of the opportunity to work with the Company permanently. The Company will announce to the public those 

criminal cases and serious abuse-of-power cases that were investigated and handled by the Company via the “Sunshine 

Tencent” WeChat official platform. This shows the Company’s determination to fight corruption and fraud, as well as its 

commitment towards creating a virtuous and honest atmosphere within the Company and the industry.

97

Annual Report 2020Corporate Governance ReportInternal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems  and  has  implemented  its  internal  control 

systems according to the COSO Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party as well as the authorisation 

and  approvals  required  for  the  key  actions  of  the  Company.  Policies  and  procedures  are  in  place  for  the  key  business 

processes. This information is clearly conveyed to employees in practice and emphasised the importance of the internal control 

systems. All employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational 

issues that set the control standards for the management of each business process.

In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework  and  guides 

the  management  of  each  business  group  to  carry  out  the  self-assessment.  The  IC  is  also  responsible  for  collecting  and 

summarising  the  results  of  self-assessment.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Company  reviews  this  summarised  self-

assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of management to the Audit Committee and the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensures that management has implemented appropriate measures and reports the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

The Company has also engaged independent professional consulting firms to perform a review of the group’s internal control 

framework and an assessment of its internal audit quality to ensure their standards are in compliance with international best 

practices.

98

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportEffectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control

for the Company’s internal audit function and that its staff qualifications and experience, training programmes and budgets are 

sufficient.

services, improving service quality, breaking down communication barriers and ultimately benefitting the wider community.

Impact on Tencent’s business

ENVIRONMENT

Environmental  protection  is  a  basic  national  policy  in  China. The Law on Energy Conservation of the People’s Republic 

of China requires  every  entity  and  individual  to  comply  with  the  legal  obligation  to  conserve  energy. The Environmental 

Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China requires that every entity and individual to protect the environment; more 

specifically, enterprises shall minimise waste production to reduce impact on the ecological environment. We recognise the 

importance of environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources. For example, our Tencent office buildings 

in  Shenzhen  have  installed  a  multitude  of  energy  saving  technologies  and  our  employees  have  been  educated  on  energy 

saving practices. The technologies have been adopted in Tencent offices in other locations globally. We also build data centres 

with considerations for the environment. Throughout 2020, Tencent has complied with all applicable laws and regulations for 

conserving and protecting the environment.

Addressing Climate Change

The  risks  and  impacts  of  climate  change  are  becoming  increasingly  significant.  We  continue  to  pay  close  attention  to  the 

impact  of  climate  change  on  our  business,  strategy,  and  financial  performance,  and  fully  support  global  climate-related 

actions.

107

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance Report 
 
 
Governance

Climate-related risks and issues are considered and monitored by the Board with the assistance of the Corporate Governance 

Committee. Our management actively evaluates and promotes carbon neutrality.

Strategy

We acknowledge that climate change brings multiple risks and opportunities for our business. Our physical risks primarily 

result  from  acute  climate  events  and  chronic  risks  caused  by  climate  change,  while  transitional  risks  mainly  come  from 

the  market  and  policy  changes  to  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy.  On  the  other  hand,  climate  change  would  create 

opportunities for us to improve energy efficiency and develop low-carbon and climate-resilient products and services.

In terms of physical risks, acute climate events caused by climate change, such as frequent typhoon weather and rainstorms, 

may affect our operational continuity; while chronic risks, such as high temperatures and droughts etc., may lead to increased 

energy consumption for office and data centre operations thereby increasing operational costs, and the increase in sea level 

may lead to loss in assets in relevant regions. We consider the impact of regional climate when allocating assets and formulate 

emergency measures for acute climate events to avoid and reduce operational impacts or asset losses caused by acute climate 

events.

In terms of transitional risks, in the context of accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, if we fail to effectively control 

or  reduce  the  carbon  emissions  generated  by  corporate  operations  and  provide  low-carbon  services  and  products,  it  may 

result in brand image damage, loss of customers, or market share reduction etc. We are researching and promoting new and 

alternative technologies for energy saving and emission reduction, purchasing clean energy, and providing more low-carbon 

services and products to reduce our own and value chain carbon emissions. We have recently announced our commitment 

in moving towards carbon neutrality to help tackle climate change and will vigorously promote the application of technology in 

energy saving and emission reduction.

At the same time, we believe that climate change has also brought various opportunities for Tencent. By improving the energy 

and water efficiency of office operations and data centres, operational costs and sensitivity to changes in carbon trading prices 

can be reduced. We provide various products and services (such as Tencent Cloud, WeCom, Tencent Meeting, etc.) to help 

customers carry out digital transformation and realise energy saving and emission reduction mission. It enables us to gain a 

more competitive position in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

108

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportRisk Management

We  have  integrated  ESG  risks  into  the  Company’s  overall  risk  assessment  and  management  system,  which  includes  risks 

related  to  climate  change.  Each  department  and  business  group  has  also  adopted  operational  management  measures  to 

manage and reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in business operations. Taking Tencent Binhai Towers as an example, 

we have adopted energy-saving and environmental protection measures such as smart lighting systems, automatic energy 

monitoring systems, and water reclamation systems etc. Tencent Binhai Towers has obtained the LEED-NC Gold Standard 

for an international green building rating system in 2017. Please refer to the section captioned “Energy Saving and Emission 

Reduction” below for the energy-saving and environmental protection measures taken in office operations and data centres.

We are also actively empowering customers to help the entire society in carbon reduction actions. The various service products 

we provide, such as Tencent Meeting, Tencent Cloud, etc., offer our customers lower-carbon options for office, business trip, 

and operations, etc. We are also increasingly exploring the application of AI in energy saving and emission reduction. In April 

2019, we proposed the “AI For FEW” (Food, Energy, and Water) initiative to the international community to explore the use 

of AI and other emerging technologies, and to provide solutions for global sustainable development goals. For example, we 

have effectively applied AI to various fields such as data centre energy saving and office building energy saving. We are also 

leveraging cloud computing, data analytics and AI to facilitate desert reclamation.

Metrics and Targets

We are actively responding to China’s carbon neutrality plan. In 2020, we set targets for energy saving and emission reduction. 

Please see the relevant disclosure under the section captioned “Energy Saving and Emission Reduction” below. Please refer 

to the “Environmental Performance Summary” section below for data related to GHG emissions. We will formulate a corporate 

carbon neutrality strategy and roadmap by integrating China’s carbon neutrality plan, international experience and our actual 

circumstances. We will reduce GHG emissions, offset or remove remaining GHG emissions, and achieve “net zero carbon 

emissions” through various practices, such as energy saving and emission reduction, tree planting and afforestation. We will 

disclose our clear progress and targets to the public in a timely manner. In 2020, we also responded to the Carbon Disclosure 

Project  (CDP)  questionnaire  for  the  first  time,  providing  customers,  investors,  and  the  market  with  relevant  important 

information about the Company’s response to climate change, including climate change risk assessment, GHG emissions, etc.

109

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEnergy Saving and Emission Reduction

Energy Saving Measures taken in Office Buildings

We  have  taken  environmental  protection  as  one  of  our  priorities  when  building  the  new  headquarters,  Tencent  Binhai 

Towers, in Shenzhen, which has been certified as meeting the LEED-NC Gold Standard during the construction stage. The 

building obtained LEED-EBOM Gold certification and the certificate of Two-star Green Building Label in 2020. The property 

management  company  of  the  Shenzhen  headquarters  has  obtained  ISO  14001  (environmental  management  system) 

certification and ISO 9001 (quality management system) certification. We will uphold the concept of “green, energy-saving, and 

environmental protection” and continue to carry out energy-saving and consumption-reducing operations and optimisation. We 

have implemented various measures to enhance efficiency of energy use and reduce water consumption and emissions.

The air conditioning systems at Tencent Binhai Towers reduce energy consumption by using alternating power from hydro-

powered pumps and electric motors. In 2020, we completed the optimisation and transformation of air conditioning terminal, 

air handling unit (“AHU”), and central air conditioning host group control system of Tencent Binhai Towers, through which 

we have improved the system’s cooling capacity to match the terminal cooling supply and demand and achieve energy-saving 

and efficient operation. Tencent Binhai Towers alone saves more than 5.98 million kWh a year. We have further optimised 

energy savings in the air conditioning and building management systems by installing automated energy monitoring devices. 

Energy consumption from air conditioning is further reduced by using natural ventilation if weather permits. Smart lighting was 

adopted to allow remote and automatic control over lighting in all office working areas, and there was a transition to an LED 

lighting system for the public areas.

In  2020,  we  determined  the  energy  management  baseline  in  every  office  building  in  Shenzhen,  formulated  the  energy 

consumption assessment benchmark and adopted energy-saving measures such as  “management + technology + policy”. 

We  also  controlled  the  cost  by  switching  off  various  energy  consumption  systems  (such  as  air  conditioning,  lighting  and 

direct drinking water systems) from back-end or onsite, optimising energy-saving management for our operations usage, and 

conducting technological transformation to improve the air conditioning terminals and AHU control system of Tencent Binhai 

Towers. The cost saved in 2020 was approximately RMB13 million, which was more than 10 million kWh based on the average 

electricity price. As a result, our facility management team has won the Group’s annual cost savings award. We will formulate 

the Group’s energy management standards based on these measures, and implement and continuously optimise the energy 

management practices in various regions.

110

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportThe office building of Tencent Binhai Towers uses a water reclamation system to reclaim water condensation from the air 

conditioning  system,  and  drain  water  from  the  water  filtration  system,  employee  shower  area  and  server  cooling  towers. 

The collected water, after being filtrated and purified, is reused for toilet flush water, watering office plants and cleaning the 

basement carpark. In addition, we promote a filtrated drinking water system in place of plastic bottled water. This measure 

reduces  the  waste  from  plastic  packaging  materials  and  indirectly  reduces  carbon  dioxide  emissions  generated  from  the 

vehicles that deliver bottled water.

We  have  adopted  energy  saving  measures  throughout  our  daily  operations.  For  example,  we  have  applied  stricter  on-site 

management of each building by combining the routine procedures with an energy consumption inspection. When people 

leave the work space, air conditioning, lights and office equipment in the corresponding office areas are required to be turned 

off. We have also set automatic shutoff for unused drinking water dispensing units in work areas to reduce energy consumption 

and waste.

We  monitor  the  levels  of  air  pollutants  (such  as  PM2.5,  PM10,  carbon  monoxide)  and  carbon  dioxide  inside  and  outside 

Tencent  Binhai  Towers  with  an  online  monitoring  system  and  a  manual  measuring  system.  To  monitor  air  quality  in  the 

building, we have installed a smart ventilation system (which regulates the ventilation automatically in response  to carbon 

monoxide levels) in the underground parking garage and air ventilation system (which monitors the ventilation continuously for 

carbon dioxide levels) in the office area. We have upgraded the cooking ventilation units in the kitchens of our office cafeteria. 

The cooking ventilation is comprised of fire-resistant environmental exhaust hoods that remove oil droplets and cooking odours 

by filtering the cooking ventilation with photolysis purification, activated carbon filtration and air ionisation. Our filtration of the 

cooking ventilation is in compliance with the PRC national standards GB18483-2001.

We reinforce the habit of garbage classification to achieve garbage source reduction and classification and we collect garbage 

in the public areas on each floor based on four categories: recyclable, kitchen waste, toxic and harmful, and other garbage.

111

Green Energy Saving Measures Taken in our Data Centres

Tencent data centres maximise energy efficiency through continuous technological innovation while exploring the application 

of low-carbon technologies in data centres at scale through pilot programs in distributed energy systems and solar photovoltaic 

power generation systems. In addition, we are also exploring the application of renewable energy trading, permitted carbon 

emissions trading, green power certificate trading and other carbon offset methods on the data centres.

In terms of site selection for our large-scale data centre campus, renewable energy of the regional power grid is an important 

criterion for us. We continue to expand new data centres in areas that are rich in renewable energy, such as Zhangjiakou 

Huailai, Guian New District and Chongqing Water and Soil High-tech Eco-City etc.

112

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance Report 
 
In terms of green data centres, we have completed the environmental impact assessment for all self-built data centres and 

have obtained the relevant approvals or filings in accordance with the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Environmental 

Impact Appraisal. In terms of green data centres, Tencent has been an industry leader. We have multiple data centres being 

selected in the 2020 National Green Data Centres List published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology: three 

of our self-owned data centres, Tencent Ebu Data Centre Building No.1, Tencent Tianjin Binhai Data Centre and Chongqing 

Tencent Cloud Computing Data Centre, as well as several leased data centres such as the Zhongjiu Huaqiao Data Systems Co., 

Ltd. and Kunshan Data Centre.

When it comes to technologies employed in the data centres, Tencent’s fourth-generation T-block data centre energy saving 

technologies, including (i) High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology for electrical systems; (ii) indirect evaporative cooling 

units; (iii) Tencent internet data centre (“IDC”) smart maintenance and control system; and (iv) fully commercialised project 

delivery solution, have been widely deployed on Tencent’s large-scale data centre in Qingyuan, Yizheng, Zhangjiakou etc.

In terms of self-generated renewable energy for self-use, we have started to build rooftop photovoltaic power generation system 

on data centre campuses that are suitable for the construction of distributed solar photovoltaic power systems, such as those 

in Qingyuan, Yizheng, Huailai, etc. The installed capacity of a single campus is about 13MWp, with an annual power output of 

about 12 million kWh, which could fully meet the power demand of the office and partial power demand of the data centres on 

the campus.

The annual average power usage effectiveness (“PUE”) of the data centres located in low-temperature climate zone is less 

than 1.25. In the future, with the construction of our large data centre campus and the application of T-block products and 

other  energy-saving  technologies,  the  annual  average  PUE  of  our  new  large  data  centre  campus  will  be  controlled  below 

1.20; according to our test data in the fourth quarter of 2020, the PUE of Tencent’s liquid-cooled technology pilot project on a 

campus in Guangdong reached 1.07.

In terms of the treatment of solid waste in the data centres (lead-acid battery, etc.), Tencent and its suppliers have entered into 

agreements which guarantee that 100% of such waste will be handled in strict compliance with relevant regulations. In terms 

of water conservation in data centres, we are preparing to initiate research on water-saving air conditioning, water recycling/

sewage treatment in data centres.

For our proprietary T-block, Mini-TB, Tencent IDC smart maintenance and control system and other IDC products, we will 

export our expertise to support industry partners. At the same time, we have set up a R&D team to develop new data centre 

software and hardware solutions to address industry pain points hoping to provide targeted technical and product support and 

services in 2021.

Note:

1. 

Due to the nature of the business, the material air emissions of the Group are GHG emissions, arising from fuels and 

purchased electricity produced from fossil fuels.

2. 

The Group’s GHG inventory includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. GHG emissions data for the year ended 

31 December 2020 is presented in carbon dioxide equivalent and is calculated based on the “2019 Baseline Emission 

Factors for Regional Power Grids in China for CDM and CCER Projects” issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment 

of China, and the “2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” issued by the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change (IPCC).

3. 

Diesel is consumed by backup power generators.

4. 

Hazardous waste produced by the Group’s office buildings mainly includes waste toner cartridge and waste ink cartridge 

from  printing  equipment.  Waste  toner  cartridge  and  waste  ink  cartridge  are  centralised  and  disposed  of  by  printing 

suppliers. Such data covers all office buildings of the Group in the Mainland of China.

5. 

Non-hazardous waste produced by the Group’s office buildings mainly includes domestic waste and non-hazardous office 

waste. As domestic waste is disposed of by the property management companies and kitchen waste recycling vendors and 

cannot be measured by us, domestic waste is estimated with reference to “Handbook on Domestic Discharge Coefficients 

for Towns in the First Nationwide Census on Contaminant Discharge” published by the State Council. Non-hazardous 

office waste is centralised for disposal by vendors, hence such data covers all office buildings of the Group in the Mainland 

of China.

6. 

Hazardous waste produced by the Group’s data centres mainly includes waste lead-acid accumulators. Waste lead-acid 

accumulators are disposed of by qualified waste recycling vendors.

7. 

Non-hazardous waste produced by the Group’s data centres mainly includes waste servers and waste hard drives. Waste 

servers and destroyed waste hard drives are centralised and recycled by waste recycling vendors. Such data covers all the 

Group’s data centres.

8. 

The number of people used in the calculation of emission density, resource density and domestic waste estimation is the 

annual average number of people working in office buildings.

6. 

Average PUE is the average of the annual PUE of the data centres. PUE, an indicator of the power efficiency of a data 

centre, is the ratio of total facility energy consumption over IT equipment energy consumption. Since 2020, we started 

reporting on the overall annual average PUE for data centres, and no longer report on the annual average PUE range for 

data centres (the range was 1.27 to 1.47 for 2018 and 1.26 to 1.52 for 2019), and we have restated the PUE data for 

2018 and 2019 accordingly.

7. 

Data of running water consumption reported above is the water consumption data provided by operators. The scope of the 

running water consumption data that can be provided by operators expanded during the year, so the data of running water 

consumption in data centres for the current year increased compared to those from previous years, and there is no direct 

comparability with previous years’ data.

amended  on  29  December  2018,  and  the Labour Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China (the  “Labour  Contract 

Law”) promulgated on 29 June 2007 and amended on 28 December 2012, while hiring employees, we shall not discriminate 

against any applicants due to their nationality, race, gender and religion, we shall enter into written employment contracts 

with each employee. We have entered into employment contracts with all employees. Our employment practice complies with 

applicable laws and regulations (including those which prohibit underage and forced labour) and does not discriminate on 

the grounds of gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religious belief, sexual orientation or family status. In 2020, we did not 

find any discrimination situation in our employment practice. Diversity is well supported in our corporate culture. We support 

employees who wants to start families by providing maternity/paternity/breastfeeding leave, flexible working hours and location 

arrangements, family insurance, etc. Through the “WomenInTech” program, we promote the stories of outstanding female 

employees in the Company and leverage the power of role models to motivate female employees.

We were awarded by Zhaopin.com as the China Best Employer in 2020. We have also been voted as the best employer in the 

PRC for 15 consecutive years since 2006 in a survey jointly conducted by Zhaopin.com and the Institute of Social Science 

Survey, Peking University.

Labour Standards

In accordance with the Labour Law, other than employers engaged in industry of art, sports and special skill, no employer 

shall recruit juveniles under the age of 16; employers shall respect the willingness of an employee to enter into an employment 

contract and shall not force or threaten employees into work by means of violence, threat of violence or deprival of personal 

freedom.  Our  recruitment  process  strictly  abides  by  the  guidelines  of  the  Tencent  Human  Resources  Policy.  Every  job 

applicant is asked to provide his/her education background, qualification and job experience, which is reviewed by the human 

resources department and verified by a due diligence agent. This allows us to hire qualified employees in accordance with job 

requirements and comply with prohibitions against underage.

Employee Departure

In accordance with the Labour Law and the Labour Contract Law, the employment contracts we enter into with our employees 

include the term of employment and the conditions for termination of employment. We have strictly complied with the aforesaid 

requirements and have entered into written or electronic employment contracts with all employees detailing duration of the 

employment and the grounds for termination of the employment.

119

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe value our relationship with our employees and handle employee departure (whether by resignation or dismissal) strictly 

in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We arrange an exit interview with each of the departing employees to 

understand the reasons for his/her departure and welcome any suggestions for improvement.

Performance Evaluation and Promotion

We have a complete performance management system that adheres to the objective and impartial principles of performance 

evaluation. Every six months, employees self-evaluate their performances, and then the supervisor of each employee refers 

to the multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate the performance of the employee. At the end of the assessment, the employee 

will  discuss,  review,  and  update  the  performance  goals  with  the  supervisor.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  formal  channels 

for  employees  to  request  for  re-assessment  of  performance.  Supervisors  are  encouraged  to  give  constructive  feedback  to 

employees from time to time to help employees’ personal growth. We also organise performance management and promotion 

experience  sharing  as  well  as  related  courses  to  help  employees  achieve  career  advancement.  Employees  may  apply  for 

promotion during their interim and year-end performance reviews, provided that  they  satisfy  the requirements  with  regard 

to the length of service and performance. Depending on the work scope, the promotion will be reviewed and considered by 

the relevant internal committee. The promotion review process is impartial and open, and there is also a formal channel for 

employees to request for re-assessment through the internal promotion management platform. Relevant internal committees 

will evaluate feedback, and we strictly respect and protect employee privacy. The promotion review is conducted in compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations on the fair treatment of employees.

Compensation and Benefits

In accordance with the Labour Law and the Labour Contract Law, the wage paid to employees shall not be lower than the 

local  standards  on  minimum  wage.  Wages  shall  be  paid  to  employees  on  a  monthly  basis  with  valid  local  currency.  The 

wages payable to employees shall not be withheld or delayed without good reason. We strictly comply with the Labour Law 

requirements and provide employees with competitive compensation and benefits.

Compensation

We are committed to providing competitive compensation and employee benefits to attract and retain talent. The remuneration 

and bonus systems are performance-based and designed to reward employees with outstanding performance and potential 

for growth. We have also set up several share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and share award 

schemes).

Benefits

The basic benefits system was built and is maintained in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and market practice. In 

addition, certain special benefits are created to motivate employees and implement our strategy.

120

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWe care for the growth of our employees and provide benefits with a Tencent cultural theme. For example, special occasions 

for  an  employee  (e.g.  work  anniversaries,  wedding  and  holiday  festivities)  are  celebrated  with  co-workers  in  the  office. 

Employees have the flexibility to choose the most suitable insurance plans and benefits for themselves and their families.

Work-Life Balance

In accordance with the Labour Law and the Labour Contract Law, the Group shall comply with the regulations on working 

hours, work breaks and vacation days and include such terms in the employment contract. We have implemented vacation day 

schedules and initiatives such as flexi-time arrangements and volunteer service days off etc. to help employees strike a good 

work-life balance. The leave scheme allows employees to enjoy annual leave, fully-paid sick leave, half-paid leave of absence 

and fully-paid special Chinese New Year leave which are above the statutory standard. Also, female employees are entitled to 

take fully-paid maternity leave, while male employees are also entitled to take fully-paid paternity leave. Employees can also 

apply for one day of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year. These labour policies all comply with the requirements under 

the Labour Law and the Labour Contract Law.

We  strive  to  create  work-life  balance  and  an  inviting  work  environment  for  employees.  We  also  organise  a  wide  variety  of 

recreational  and  leisure  activities  (e.g.  running,  photography,  music,  dance,  language  classes)  for  employees.  We  have 

provided various recreational and leisure facilities in our Shenzhen headquarters, such as a 300-meter running track, indoor 

rock-climbing wall, table tennis tables, pool tables, a badminton court and a full-sized basketball court, etc.

Communication

We are committed to establishing various comprehensive communication channels for our employees. There are currently 

annual meetings of the Company and various departments, face-to-face discussion forums, special magazines, and internal 

social media platforms for employees and management. Through these communication channels, the Company conveys and 

strengthens corporate strategy and culture, and encourages employees to speak freely. We conduct a company-wide employee 

satisfaction  survey  through  an  independent  third  party  every  year,  based  on  completely  anonymous  feedback,  we  collect 

employees’ suggestions for the Company’s development in an all-round way as a basis for performance improvement. In 2020, 

a total of 37,896 employees participated in responding to the survey, with an effective answer rate of 91%. The employee 

satisfaction score has improved as compared to 2019.

121

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportOccupational Health and Safety

In accordance with the Labour Law, we employ a labour safety and hygiene policy. The policy aims to prevent accidents in the 

workplace and reduce occupational hazards. In accordance with the Social Insurance Law of the People’s Republic of China 

promulgated on 28 October 2010 and amended on 29 December 2018, we pay full allowance for social insurance for our 

employees. The social insurance includes endowment insurance, medical insurance, work injury insurance, unemployment 

insurance  and  maternity  insurance.  We  provide  various  supplementary  insurance  benefits  (including  medical  insurance, 

critical illness insurance, accident insurance and life insurance) for employees and their families. Throughout 2020, we have 

strictly complied with the relevant laws and regulations regarding occupational health and safety.

We strive to provide a safe and comfortable work environment for our employees. There are established security and fire safety 

systems as well as food safety monitoring systems. We invite third parties to conduct security risk audits on our premises every 

year, discover hardware defects based on risks, and identify defects and deficiencies in the operation management system 

based on risks, so as to address hidden risks and prevent problems before they occur.

We formulate detailed emergency plans for fire safety, natural disasters, personal injury, safety order, etc., and conduct regular 

drills and simulation tests to ensure implementation and continuous optimisation.

We adhere to  “Tech for good, mutual help and assistance”. In case of any medical emergency within workplace, we have 

deployed the automated external defibrillator (AED) emergency system in the office in 2020, formulated emergency plans and 

continued to test and optimise the mechanism thereby ensuring employees’ safety under emergency circumstances.

We  have  appointed  a  team  to  attend  to  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  employees.  We  arrange  annual  medical  check-

ups for employees and organise health seminars, fitness sessions, on-site medical consultations as well as face-to-face and 

telephone counselling from time to time.

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately implemented a work-from-home policy and deployed various technical 

and human resource support, such as technology assistance in setting up remote access to office phones and equipment, as 

well as version upgrades and bandwidth expansion for productivity and collaboration tools such as WeCom, Tencent Meeting 

and Tencent Docs. Our teams worked relentlessly to source and secure supply of urgent resources such as facemasks for 

employees.  We  strived  to  provide  necessary  medical  support  and/or  support  for  quarantine  arrangement  for  employees  in 

need.  We  also  helped  employees  cope  with  pandemic-related  emotions  and  mental  health  issues  via  online  consultation 

programs.  Through  Weixin  Mini  Programs,  Official  Accounts  and  WeCom,  we  enabled  employees  to  report  health  related 

information, e.g., contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, so as to minimise transmission risks and provide timely 

assistance. We also developed Anti-COVID handbooks and educational videos to enhance employees’ awareness of prevention 

measures.

122

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportAs businesses gradually resumed to normal in China, we applied strict procedures to ensure a  safe working environment, 

including  extra  disinfection  of  air  conditioning  system,  daily  temperature  checking  and  social  distancing  policies  in  public 

areas such as elevators, canteens and meeting rooms. For example, we closed the office canteens during pandemic period 

and arranged delivery of separately packaged breakfast and lunch boxes to the desks of each staff who worked in the office, 

to minimise transmission risks. We closely monitored the local pandemic situation and adjusted our work-from-home or split-

team arrangement in order to ensure employees’ safety and health.

Employee Development and Training

Employee talent is our most important asset. We are committed to helping our employees realise their potential. We make 

significant investments in employee development and training and we encourage employees to attend external and internal 

trainings.

We  have  adopted  relevant  policies  to  ensure  that  employee  training  is  provided  in  a  user-friendly  format.  For  example, 

supervisors must assist in designing professional development plans for employees and evaluating employee training effects. 

To  ensure  the  quality  of  training,  we  have  formulated  a  policy  that  contains  the  instructors’  qualifications  and  experience 

requirements and the goals of the plan and cooperated with educational institutions to develop training plans.

In 2007, we founded our own training university, Tencent Academy. It offers different training programmes at each stage of 

an employee’s career, including an induction, on-the-job training and leadership training for different levels, and carries out 

educational qualification improvement support programs for all employees, such as supporting employees to obtain applicable 

professional certificates, etc. As our employees get more experienced and are promoted, we also provide them with relevant 

corresponding and consistent training, including general courses, professional courses, and subject lecture sharing targeted 

for different levels. Employees can choose suitable courses by themselves and develop their own learning plans. In addition, 

Tencent Academy has set up an online learning platform and a mobile learning system in order to allow employees to learn 

anytime and anywhere. In 2017, one of our training programmes won the Excellence in Practice Award by the Association for 

Talent Development.

To help employees in different positions cope with professional needs, Tencent Academy offers courses on product (providing 

in-depth product research for different product teams), operational skills, technology, data analysis, marketing, design, risk 

management,  customer  service  etc.  As  of  31  December  2020,  Tencent  Academy  offered  over  500  live  courses  and  over 

10,000 in-person courses and employed over 1,500 in-house part-time instructors. The average in-house training hours per 

employee was 32 hours and around 98% of employees received training.

Besides, we also provide employees with an internal expert platform, so that senior employees or employees with professional 

knowledge in a certain field can freely share their experiences with everyone, and employees can also establish contacts with 

internal experts through this platform. We also intend to make available our training resources to business partners and other 

companies in the industry in order to promote industry training resources sharing and capacity building.

Supply Chain Management

Our  supply  chain  management  programme  attaches  supreme  importance  to  managing  the  ethics  risk  associated  with  the 

relationship between our procurement employees and our business partners. It also focuses on teaching those employees who 

are involved in procurement to recognise and mitigate the inherent risks.

We  have  formulated  a  code  of  conduct  to  standardise  the  behaviour  of  employees  engaged  in  procurement  activities.  To 

minimise the ethics risks, such employees are also required to declare any relationship they may have with our suppliers in 

writing. 

Suppliers  which  are  formally  engaged  by  the  Group’s  procurement  department  are  required  to  agree  to  the  terms  of  a 

declaration and undertaking in relation to anti-commercial bribery in conducting business with the Group (the “Anti-commercial 

Bribery Declaration”), as well as the terms of a declaration in relation to labour rights, health and safety and environmental 

protection. Such declaration and undertaking also explicitly require the suppliers to comply with all the requirements of local 

laws and regulations. During the year ended 31 December 2020, all domestic suppliers which were formally engaged by the 

Group’s procurement department had completed the self-assessment and signed the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration.

We have maintained a database of qualified suppliers which are ready to take orders from us. The Group has also launched 

a new supplier collaboration system for the online management of the whole procurement life cycle, covering the aspects of 

finding and selecting suppliers, and evaluating performance and terminating engagement of suppliers.

We have an internal policy which sets out the procedures for supplier onboarding. The procurement department looks for 

qualified suppliers in the market and conducts standard or simplified verification on the suppliers depending on the duration 

of the cooperation, the order volume and the nature of the request. Before engaging a supplier, we will conduct due diligence  

(including qualification check, site visit etc.) on the supplier. Staff participating in due diligence include members from the 

procurement  department,  the  requesting  department,  and  the  specialised  department  (if  applicable).  The  results  will  be 

reported to the procurement department for final determination.

We  normally  ask  for  price  quotations  from  at  least  three  vendors.  Other  factors  including  delivery  time  and  technical 

capabilities of the vendors etc. will be taken into consideration when selecting vendors. If there is only one vendor available for 

selection as it dominates the relevant market or it is the only vendor with access to the required goods/services, the particular 

procurement arrangement with such vendor will require special approval with a sufficient and reasonable justification provided 

by the technical department or the requesting department.

126

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWe evaluate the performance of our suppliers from time to time and take appropriate steps to address any issues with the 

quality of the suppliers as part of our supply chain management. In 2020, we completed performance evaluation on about 400 

suppliers. For suppliers with unsatisfactory performance, subject to applicable contractual arrangements, we may (i) discuss 

with them on the remedial steps to be taken by them; (ii) suspend the cooperation; (iii) reduce the order volume; (iv) impose 

penalties; or (v) suspend payment. The procurement department may disqualify a supplier for the following events: (i) we 

suffer from material economic losses as a result of the delayed delivery, quality issue or breach of contract by the supplier; (ii) 

the supplier has received the lowest rating in the rating scale for two consecutive quarters; and (iii) the supplier is in serious 

breach of business ethics.

When engaging gaming-related suppliers, in order to minimise the risk of IP infringement in the procurement process, we 

have developed a set of process specifications for potential suppliers to conduct self-assessment on their commitment to IP 

protection and other aspects. All suppliers involved in content output must complete the video learning courses related to IP 

protection and sign an “Undertaking Related to Risk Management and Control of Game Content”. We also pay attention to 

selecting environmentally friendly products and services  when selecting suppliers related to office buildings. For example, 

we have required all self-built office buildings to obtain the ISO 14001 environmental management system certification, and 

its system certification is checked by the administrative department every year. When we employ computer room suppliers, 

we conduct site visit, pay special attention to the supplier’s PUE. In addition, we also have our own monitoring system and 

measure the PUE of suppliers every month to ensure that suppliers can meet the standards we set.

We strive to provide the best user experience and pay high attention to the quality of our products and services. 

In accordance with the Anti-monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China which took effect on 1 August 2008 and the Anti-

monopoly Guidelines of the Anti-monopoly Commission of the State Council on Platform Economy promulgated on 7 February  

2021,  we  are  obliged  to  promote  the  orderly,  innovative  and  sound  development  of  platform-based  economy  through  fair 

competition and to safeguard the welfare of consumers and the public interests of the society. We proactively comply with such 

regulatory requirements.

In  accordance  with  the Decision of the State Council on Implementation of Access Management of Financial Holding 

Companies and  the Provisional Administrative Measures of Financial Holding Companies,  under  certain  circumstances,  a 

non-financial enterprise, natural person or recognised legal person which holds controlling shares in or actually controls two

materials to ensure their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We also build in safeguards on data security and 

user privacy, product health and safety, customer complaints, advertising content and IP rights as described below.

User Privacy and Data Security

We closely monitor the relevant new domestic and international laws and regulations, and timely update our compliance and 

legal know-how, in order to implement the applicable legal requirements into the Company’s products and business processes 

as soon as possible, to ensure compliance with the latest legal requirements.

The domestic and overseas laws and regulations we follow include Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, Criminal Law 

of the People’s Republic of China, Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, E-commerce Law of the People’s 

Republic of China, Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests, Personal

Applications (App), Circular on Issuing the Practical Guide to Cyber Security Standards: Guide to Self-evaluation of Collection 

and Use of Personal Information by Mobile Internet Applications (App).

In accordance with applicable data protection laws, as an Internet information service provider, we obtain users’ consent before 

collecting and using users’ personal information. We stipulate rules on the collection and use of users’ personal information 

and publicise the same in the places and websites where we operate or serve.

We  regard  user  information  security  and  privacy  protection  as  our  lifeline.  We  take  security,  autonomy,  compliance  and 

transparency as the goal of Tencent’s privacy protection. Security means that we have an adequate security mechanism and 

security technology system to protect users’ data security in an all-round way; autonomy means that we integrate the concept 

of privacy protection into product design so that users can manage their privacy settings independently with convenient privacy 

settings design; compliance means that we comply with the requirements of laws and regulations to protect users’ personal 

information  rights;  transparency  means  that  through  privacy  policies  and  privacy  protection  guidelines,  we  improve  the 

transparency of privacy protection and protect users’ right to know.

As for privacy protection, we adhere to the following principles:

1. 

Safe and reliable: we try our best to prevent user data leakage, damage and loss through reasonable and effective data 

security technology and management process.

2. 

Independent  choice:  we  provide  convenient  data  management  options  for  users  to  make  appropriate  choices  and 

manage personal data.

3. 

Protect communication secrets: we strictly abide by laws and regulations, protect users’ communication secrets, and 

provide secure communication services.

4. 

Reasonable and necessary: we only collect necessary data so as to provide better services to users.

5. 

Clarity and transparency: we strive to introduce the privacy policy to users in simple language for easy understanding of 

our data processing methods.

6. 

Integrate privacy protection into product design.

129

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe believe that user data security and privacy protection are the primary premises for creating secure, high-quality products 

and user experience. We insist on protecting the privacy and security of users’ data and always insist on using data in order 

to benefit users, striving to improve products and services, and strictly complying with applicable laws and regulations. We 

incorporate the applicable laws and regulatory requirements on privacy protection into our internal policies, taking into account 

our products and services’ specific characteristics and the relevant social responsibilities. We have also developed specific 

systems and processes to collect and process user data to ensure that our products and services comply with applicable laws.

We have considered and deployed user privacy protection in the early stage of designing products and services. This concept 

inspired us to formulate and implement Tencent PBD privacy protection – P stands for Person, that is, to protect user privacy 

as the core value. B stands for Button, which provides users with reasonable and efficient privacy protection through “privacy 

button” (product design), symbolising user control. We try our best to make users easily manage their personal data through 

simple  key  steps.  D  stands  for  Data,  which  ensures  data  security  in  all  aspects.  We  have  advanced  and  complete  data 

security technologies and management measures. These technologies and measures ensure that we have effective security 

risk monitoring, defence and response mechanisms to protect user data in an all-round way. PBD outlines our thinking and 

practice on user data security and privacy protection.

We use Tencent Privacy Protection Platform (https://privacy.qq.com/) to provide users with unified access to query privacy 

protection guidelines for multiple Tencent products, to facilitate users to better manage information authorisation, to modify 

privacy settings, etc. At the same time, the platform also works with Tencent customer service to create a personal information 

protection  zone  to  provide  users  with  various  channels  to  reflect  privacy  issues  that  they  have  encountered.  Our  privacy 

protection policy is also published on the product’s official website and app which is also available for access on the Tencent 

Privacy Protection Platform. Users can also use the feedback button in the website and app and our unified privacy feedback 

email (Dataprivacy@tencent.com) at any time to submit complaints or make inquiries.

We  and  our  employees  keep  strict  confidential  the  personal  information  of  users  collected  and  used  during  the  provision 

of service, and do not leak, distort, damage, sell or provide the same to others illegally. We establish and perfect the user 

information  protection  system  by  hierarchically  managing  the  access  rights  of  internal  staff  to  ensure  the  security  of  the 

personal information collected by us and to prevent any leakage, damage or loss of the information. We provide a quick and 

convenient channel for employees to look up the Company’s data  security policy through internal communication tools so 

that employees can timely confirm whether their behaviour meets the Company’s security policy requirements. If employees 

come across potential data security violations, they can also report internally using the internal communication tools or unified 

reporting system; in case of violations, the Company will take strict disciplinary measures, including but not limited to criticism 

notice, punishment, etc.

130

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWe have a dedicated privacy team within the legal department which is responsible for handling data protection matters. We 

evaluate specific products from the perspective of privacy protection on a regular or ad-hoc basis and perform privacy risk 

assessments before the launch of new products to ensure that our products are not exposed to the risk of privacy infringement 

or leakage of user data.

At  the  same  time,  our  Technology  and  Engineering  Group,  or  TEG,  is  responsible  for  managing  the  data  security  of  our 

products  and  platforms.  By  benefitting  from  the  technical  support  of  Tencent  United  Security  Laboratory  (covering  seven 

professional laboratories, focusing on security technology research and construction of security attack and defence system, 

and  covering  key  Internet  fields  such  as  connection,  system,  application,  information,  equipment,  cloud,  etc.),  TEG  has 

information security department and other specialised teams and provides a full range of security protection for the Group’s 

products and services.

We  have  developed  a  comprehensive  proactive  and  reactive  defence  programme.  We  take  the  initiative  to  enhance  the 

detection capability of basic security and in-depth defence and implement strict monitoring, timely alarm and blocking, regular 

monitoring and auditing, and tracing abnormal behaviours on the security system and database. We also take the initiative 

to conduct blue army offensive and defensive tests to identify potential risks to current systems and security capabilities. Our 

safety emergency response team also makes timely passive defence and deployment through 7 x 24 emergency response 

mechanism. In addition, through Tencent Security Response Center (TSRC), we invite global “white-hat hackers” and security 

experts to provide us feedback on security loopholes and jointly defend user security. Our in-house expert team also exports 

security solutions to the global security community through TSRC. We provide data privacy and information security training to 

all employees (including full-time, part-time and interns), to improve employee awareness and establish an enterprise culture 

that attaches importance to privacy protection and information security.

We also actively communicate with various national ministries and commissions such as the Cyberspace Administration of 

China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the Ministry of Public Security 

of the People’s Republic of China and the Standardization Administration of China to seek guidance and strive to do a better 

job in data privacy protection. In 2020, various national ministries and commissions updated the law enforcement frequently, 

and we kept in touch with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office and other 

ministries and commissions to follow up the latest developments and ensure the compliance of our business.

Furthermore, we actively participate in shaping the development of the industry framework on privacy protection. For example, 

our privacy experts are members of the International Association of Privacy Professionals. We have obtained certification from 

the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and other domestic and international certifications for our network and 

data security management system.

fraud, etc.) to serve and empower many Tencent Cloud users. In addition, we  have also made productive progress in the 

research of advanced security attack and defence technology, network security practice, and security ecology construction. We 

have established close cooperation with many security teams in the industry, and are committed to improving the security of 

Tencent products and creating a more secure Internet ecology.

At the same time, we also actively explore and develop technology to help improve the data privacy protection level of the 

Company’s business in 2020. For example, we have developed a data privacy compliance assessment system, enabling the 

Company’s data privacy protection with the help of the Company’s major security technology laboratories’ superior technical 

capabilities.

We are also actively integrating the Company’s technical force to develop cutting-edge technologies and application platforms

Games

One  of  our  important  businesses  is  our  online  games  business.  We  need  to  comply  with  the  relevant  laws,  regulations 

and  policy  requirements  in  relation  to  online  games  in  the  PRC,  mainly  including  the Law of the Protection of Minors, 

Telecommunication Regulation of the People’s Republic of China,  the Administrative Regulations on Publishing,  the 

Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services and the Provisions on the Administration of Online Publishing 

Services.  In  accordance  with  the  above  regulations,  when  we  operate  value-added  telecommunications  business,  we  are 

required to apply to administrative authorities of information industries to obtain a Value-Added Telecommunication Business 

Operation Permit. When we operate online publishing service for online games, we must obtain an Online Publishing Service 

License.

We have been actively implementing various measures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies. 

For instance, we have already obtained the relevant credentials for publishing and operating online games, such as the Value-

Added Telecommunication Business Operation Permit and the Online Publishing Service License. Meanwhile, in our business 

operation, we are among the first beginners to actively explore into the field of juveniles’ protection.

To safeguard the physical and mental health of online game users and juveniles, we have implemented the real name system 

and  anti-addiction  system  in  accordance  with  the  regulatory  requirements  of  the  PRC  and  strengthened  the  promotion  of 

healthy games and anti-addiction through various channels. In February 2017, we were the first to launch a series of services 

on “Tencent Parental Guardian Platform” which assist parents to monitor the gaming habits of their underage children. This is 

the technical platform aiming to provide assistance to guardians who wish to help their underage children to develop healthy 

gaming practice in the online game industry. In July 2017, we implemented the Healthy Gameplay System on Honour of Kings, 

which sends reminders to players or forces them to suspend the game if players spend too much time on the game in one 

day. In 2018, we upgraded the Healthy Gameplay System, tightened the requirements for identity verification and made the 

system available for more games. We also launched a customer service which sends reminders when a game player may have 

engaged in overspending and provides subsequent counselling. In 2019, the Healthy Gameplay System covered all mobile 

games operated by us in the Mainland of China. In 2020, the coverage of “Tencent Parental Guardian Platform” was expanded 

to QQ Mini Programs and Weixin Mini Programs and provided users with statistical usage time, duration management, one-

click disable and other management functions to provide more comprehensive management tools for parents. Meanwhile, 

the “family communication” module is opened up to provide effective information for parents through parents’ classroom and 

other ways to help them bridge the “digital divide”. In June of the same year, based on “restricting play, charging and curfew” 

for real name minors, we improved the user identification technology to solve the problem of  “children using their parents’ 

identity information to bypass the supervision”, and screened the suspected minors. Users who refused or failed to pass the

“Percentage of the total number of products sold or shipped subject to recalls for health and safety reasons” and “recall procedures” 

are not closely relevant to the Company’s main businesses.

133

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance Reportverification were restricted by the Healthy Gameplay System in the game or could not continue to recharge. To prevent parents 

from performing verification without knowledge, Tencent continues to optimise face recognition measures and has launched 

multiple functions such as voice and picture double prompt. At present, the aforementioned functions have been applied to 

more than 100 mobile game products of Tencent games, including Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite. In December 

2020, under the  guidance of the National Press and Publication Administration, China Audio-video and Digital Publishing 

Association officially released the group standard of  “Age-appropriate Tips for Online Games” (Trial) (hereinafter referred to 

as “Group Standard”). We participated in the preparation as one of the leading units. The Group Standard divided the scope 

of the age of minors’ games into three stages, namely 8+, 12+, 16+, and made explicit provisions on the style, embodiment, 

content and other specific matters of the age prompt diagram. Tencent actively cooperated to promote the pilot implementation 

of the Group Standard and has completed the adaptation of 10 games, including “Honour of Kings”, “Peacekeeper Elite” and 

other popular games.

We continue to pay attention to the operation stability, technical reliability, data privacy compliance and content legitimacy of 

online game products. We establish a complete closed-loop process of full-dimensional audit in advance, real-time monitoring 

in the event and timely disposal afterwards, and establish a multi-department joint work team to ensure the implementation of 

relevant requirements and processes.

In  addition,  the  22nd  session  of  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  13th  National  People’s  Congress  of  the  PRC  revised  and 

passed the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Minors on 17 October 2020, which will come into force 

on  1  June  2021.  The  newly-revised Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Minors stipulates  Internet 

service providers’ responsibilities and obligations. We are taking forward the implementation of the relevant provisions in a 

comprehensive manner.

Social Network

According to the provisions of the Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, any individual or organisation using 

the Internet shall abide by the Constitution of the PRC and other relevant laws, and shall not use the Internet to fabricate 

or  disseminate  false  information,  disrupt  economic  and  social  order,  and  shall  not  carry  out  activities  that  infringe  on  the 

reputation,  privacy,  IP  rights  and  other  legitimate  rights  and  interests  of  others.  Suppose  a  network  operator  discovers 

information that is prohibited by laws or administrative regulations from being released or transmitted, it shall immediately 

stop  transmitting  the  information,  take  measures  such  as  eliminating  and  preventing  the  spread  of  information,  keeping 

relevant records, and reporting to the relevant competent authorities. To provide users with healthy and safe platform services, 

Tencent has been actively implementing various measures to fulfil its platform responsibilities and govern users’ violations of 

laws and regulations or infringement through social platforms (such as Weixin, QQ, etc.) to ensure compliance with relevant 

laws, regulations and policies. According to relevant national laws and regulations, and agreements such as WeChat Software 

License and Service Agreement, WeChat Official Accounts Platform Service Agreement and QQ Software License and Service 

Agreement,  if  users  spread  unlawful  information  through  WeChat  personal  account,  WeChat  Official  Accounts,  QQ  and 

Qzone, once found and proven, the platform will timely block the unlawful content and deal with the relevant accounts and 

134

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance Reportrelevant chat groups (such as warning, limiting some functions of the account, blocking the account, etc.). Illegal information 

related to the public welfare and the livelihood of people, including but not limited to the sale of counterfeit medical devices, 

illicit sales of illegal goods and rumours etc., has been repeatedly countered by the platform after the outbreak of COVID-19 

pandemic. At the same time, we attach great importance to the publicity and education of users and prompt users to improve 

their awareness of risk prevention through “Weixin Safety Centre”, “QQ Security Centre” Official Accounts and other official 

channels,  jointly  resist  Internet  pornography,  fraud  and  other  risks,  provide  users  with  smooth  channels  for  infringement 

complaints and reports, and guide users to make complaints and reports on violations of laws, regulations or violations of their 

legitimate rights and interests through the platform entrance. In 2020, the Group was not aware of any serious violation of the 

above laws and regulations.

With  the  development  of  Mini  Programs  and  Mini  Games  platform,  Tencent  continues  to  optimise  the  audit  standards 

and  inspection  mechanism  of  Mini  Programs  and  Mini  Games  access.  The  Company  conducts  reviews  on  the  developers 

and application contents of the Mini Programs and Mini Games submitted by developers to access the platform strictly in 

accordance to legal and regulatory requirements. If developers’ services involve special categories such as medical, financial, 

and gaming, they shall provide the corresponding qualification and approval documents etc. For developers who fail to provide 

the  corresponding  certificates  as  required,  access  of  their  Mini  Programs  and  Mini  Games  to  the  platform  will  be  denied. 

According to users’ complaints and reports on Mini Programs, we will also inspect Mini Programs’ operation from time to time 

and take corresponding measures for developers who fail to operate legally.

In order to allow minors to grow in a healthy environment, Tencent has launched “underage mode” in a number of products 

or  developed  independent  versions  suitable  for  minors.  For  example,  when  the  underage  mode  has  been  activated  for 

Tencent Video, Weishi and other products, users’ screen time will be limited and users will be reminded to take rests. When 

the  underage  mode  has  been  activated  for  QQ,  the  application  interface  will  be  more  simplistic,  and  will  not  show  any 

advertisement, live broadcast, games and other entertainment functions, as well as services that are not suitable for minors 

such as networking with strangers etc.

A  total  of  7,293  rumour  refuting  articles  were  published  on  WeChat  Official  Accounts  Platform  in  2020,  and  the  rumour 

refuting pages were viewed 760 million times. At the same time, the rumour refuting assistant Mini Program of WeChat Official 

Accounts  Platform  has  introduced  several  third-party  scientific  research,  academic  and  other  authoritative  institutions  to 

conduct scientific rumour refutation on various rumours (including official account articles and some widely spread rumour 

samples) on WeChat platform. In 2020, 54.58 million Weixin users used it. With the mission of  “Value for Users, Tech for 

Good”, the Tencent News Verification Platform aims to create a network-wide rumour refuting content output think tank for 

verification and confirmation of facts to combat the spread of untrue information on the Internet. At present, the information in 

the think tank covers food safety, nutrition, health care and other fields.

Weixin/WeChat and QQ each provides a mechanism for users to report any false or improper content transmitted on their 

platforms. In order to protect users’ original content, Weixin/WeChat has released a new function for Weixin/WeChat official 

account  holders  in  December  2017,  stating  the  originality  of  the  content  generated  by  Weixin/WeChat,  to  help  effectively 

identify and prevent copyright infringement.

135

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportIn addition, Weixin and QQ have constantly improved their functions to provide a barrier-free experience for the elderly and 

vulnerable groups, including bigger font, Weixin relatives card, and text extraction function of pictures and expressions for 

the visually impaired, in order to help the elderly and vulnerable groups integrate into the digital society and bridge the digital 

divide.

Digital Content

We  have  always  attached  importance  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the  digital  content  industry,  complied  with  the  laws  and 

regulations in China’s Internet news, audio-visual and other related business areas, and actively implemented various measures 

to ensure the development of its business in a compliant manner. At the same time, in the process of business operation, we 

should take the lead in juvenile protection, and actively explore the practical experience of the industry.

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  in  2020,  Tencent  Video’s  “Little  Penguin  Paradise”  content  platform  products  for  minors  were 

upgraded. Through the functions of realisation of innovative interaction ability, high-quality mass video series, five-dimensional 

knowledge system, green guard mechanism etc, Tencent Video created a one-stop growth space for children from multiple 

dimensions such as content innovation, intelligence cultivation, health education, etc., to help children and parents learn and 

progress together. At the same time, we are also well aware of the importance of “health education”. In the “Little Penguin 

Paradise” app, eye protection mode is built-in. It also provides time setting, volume reminder and other functions, creating a 

healthy viewing environment for parents to rest assured and let children enjoy the process of learning and entertainment more 

freely. We hope to bring a positive and upbeat guide to the growth of minors through high-quality content experience.

Tencent News continues to invest in original, in-depth content and precipitate user value. In the “White Book on the Social 

Value of China’s Internet Media in 2019”, “Research Report on Public Cognition and Information Communication of COVID-19” 

published by the State Information Center, and the  “Survey Report on Credibility of China’s Internet Media” released by the 

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Tencent News ranked first in terms of social value, satisfaction and credibility 

among  all  commercial  media.  In  terms  of  the  healthy  development  of  content,  Tencent  News  adheres  to  the  profound 

cultivation  of  original  content,  creates  high-quality  IP,  continues  to  create  beautiful  content  with  the  brand,  and  uses  the 

content to achieve a useful link between business and users, to realise the promotion of cognitive value and business value.

FinTech

We have long been committed to providing safe, convenient and professional payment services for Internet users and various 

enterprises and we continue to comply with relevant laws and regulations. The types of payment businesses include online 

payment, mobile phone payment and bank card acquisition, and the types of customers include individuals and merchants.

early 2020, we optimised the platform display for financial wealth management products and categorised the financial wealth 

management products as stable financial wealth management, advanced financial wealth management etc. in order to provide 

our customers with better quality and more stable financial services. We will continue to conduct self-examination, optimisation 

and  standardisation  of  our  products  in  accordance  with  laws  and  regulations  related  to  financial  products,  including  the 

Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Publicly-offered Securities Investment Fund Distributors, the Circular on

Internet service

In accordance with Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests promulgated 

on 31 October 1993 and amended on 25 October 2013, when we provide our customers with goods or service, we adhere 

to social morality, operate business in good faith, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers. We also seek 

consumers’ opinions on commodities or services provided to them and accept consumers’ supervision. In accordance with 

the E-Commerce Law of the People’s Republic of China,  effective  on  1  January  2019,  we,  as  an  Internet  company,  have 

established an accessible and effective mechanism for receiving complaints and abuse reports, publishing of information on 

complaints and abuse reporting methods, prompt handling and resolution for complaints and abuse reports. The Company 

puts  great  importance  on  customer  service;  thus  it  proactively  complies  with  all  relevant  laws  and  regulations  regarding 

customer service. All product departments of the Company conduct regular product research, including online questionnaire, 

social  media,  telephone  calls,  etc.  to  collect  users’  feedback  on  products  to  understand  users’  satisfaction  and  popular 

opinions, and pay attention accordingly during product designs and updates.

To  provide  a  better  user  experience,  we  have  set  up  a  complaint  handling  programme,  which  clearly  sets  out  the 

responsibilities of customer service department and the time required to resolve complaints. In addition, we also help 

visualise the service entrance scene, so that users can have quick access to customer service in the first instance where 

problem occurs, and achieve the delivery of service with the shortest service path.

138

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance Report4.  We  have  strengthened  the  infrastructure  construction  of  the  system.  Complaints  can  be  classified  according  to  the 

degree  of  urgency  and  risk,  so  that  the  customer  service  staff  can  better  give  priority  to  relevant  cases  and  handle 

complaints in a timely manner.

5. 

Build a strong closed-loop self-help tool, which can respond in seconds throughout the day, providing better efficiency 

than manual service. At present, the one-time solution rate of Tencent customer service self-service tools has reached 

85%.

a technology-oriented company and we stress the importance of the observation and protection of IP rights. 

We have established our dedicated IP team that is mainly responsible for day-to-day management of legal matters involving 

trademark, patent, copyright, domain names and other IP rights.

We began a comprehensive programme for the management of IP at an  early stage. We have consistently applied  for  the 

registration of IP rights since the early stages of its establishment. With the successful development of our business, we have 

expanded our global IP portfolio to cover more than 100 countries and regions. As of 31 December 2020, we have obtained 

over 30,000 officially registered trademarks and over 17,000 issued patents. Coupled with our creation of a vast amount of 

copyrighted  content,  we  have  accumulated  IP  assets  of  considerable  value.  Our  IP  team  has  developed  a  comprehensive 

database for our patents, trademarks and copyrights and our strong data analytical skills enable us to manage and monitor 

our IP rights in a meticulous and efficient manner. To combat infringement of IP rights, our IP team has also established a 

comprehensive and efficient monitoring and maintenance system, and has devised various enforcement measures to protect 

our IP rights. Please see further details on the Company’s website (https://www.tencent.com/legal/html/en-us/property.html).

We actively participate in public affairs and the consultations on legislations, as well as strive to promote the awareness of IP 

protection in the Internet industry. As members of the China National Information Technology Standardisation Committee, 

the  China  Intellectual  Property  Society,  the  Patent  Protection  Association  of  China,  the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium,  the 

International  Trademark  Association  and  the  China  Trademark  Association,  we  have  participated  in  the  consultations  on 

legislative amendments to the PRC laws and regulations relating to patents and trademarks and have made recommendations 

in the development of industry standards. We have actively participated in the development of the standard patent issues in 

recent years. In particular, we standardised the video coding technology by using our accumulated experience in audio and 

video technology.

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWithin the past decade, we have been awarded the “WIPO-SIPO Award for Chinese Outstanding Patented Invention” jointly 
by World Intellectual Property Organisation and the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, the “Trademark Innovation 
Award” jointly by World Intellectual Property Organisation and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the 
“China  Copyright  Gold  Awards”  by  the  National  Copyright  Administration  of  the  PRC  and  the  World  Intellectual  Property 

Organisation multiple times, signifying our contribution to the development of independent innovation of the PRC. We have 
also been recognised as a “National Copyright Demonstration Unit” several times, demonstrating our outstanding performance 

in management and protection of copyright.

Anti-Corruption

According to the Law Against Unfair Competition in the People’s Republic of China, business operators shall not use monies, 

assets or other means to bribe an entity or individuals to obtain transaction opportunities or competitive advantage. According 
to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, corruption and bribery may constitute a serious criminal offence. We 

strictly comply with applicable laws and regulations for anti-corruption and embrace the value of integrity, being proactive, 

cooperation and creativity. To promote the idea of integrity, we have developed various systems and measures to detect and 

deter corruption, bribery or any other fraudulent activities. High-risk business and management are regularly under audit to 

assess the effectiveness of the internal control system and raise red flags as soon as possible to ensure the Group complies 

with ethical standards which we strive to uphold. In 2020, the anti-fraud investigation department has found more than 50 

cases of violations of various Tencent rules and policies, more than 90 people have been dismissed, amongst which more than 

40 people suspected of crimes have been transferred to the police.

Risk Management and Internal Control Policy

In 2016, we  updated the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy (the  “Policy”) with a system  comprising  three  risk 

management lines of defence. The first line is business and functional departments. We provide targeted training and guidance 

for relevant employees to help them identify potential risks in their daily work and report to the superior. The risk management 

and  internal  control  department  acts  as  the  second  line  of  defence,  establishes  a  list  of  major  risks  at  the  business  level 

through  the  collection,  summary,  analysis  and  other  steps,  and  ensures  that  appropriate  risk  response  strategies  and 

monitoring measures have been taken for review by the management, and submits them to the Audit Committee for review 

before reporting to the Board. The risk management and internal control department analyses and evaluates the response to 

major risks from time to time, and reports the results to the Audit Committee once every quarter. The Board entrusts the Audit 

Committee to assess and determine the nature and extent of the risks the Company is willing to accept to achieve the corporate 

objectives, determine the major risk response strategies and responsible departments, and promote the implementation of 

the  management  through  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  department  from  top  to  bottom.  The  IA  and  the  anti-

fraud investigation department act as the third line of defence. The IA is responsible for providing independent evaluation 
and assurance for the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control system. It also supervises the 

management team and helps them improve their risk management and internal monitoring skills. The IA is highly independent. 

The anti-fraud investigation department is responsible for receiving reports through multiple channels and timely following up 

and investigating suspected fraud cases. At the same time, it also assists the management in advocating integrity values and 
Sunshine Code to all of the Company’s employees to ensure a 100% acknowledgment of the Sunshine Code. Both the IA and 

the anti-fraud investigation department report directly to the Audit Committee. Through the three lines of defence mechanism, 

we regularly provide targeted risk control training for employees at all levels and businesses of the Company, to enhance the 
overall staff’s awareness of risk management.

142

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportThe Policy sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in risk management and control (including those 

in relation to frauds). It is emphasised in the Policy that the management of each business  group  is primarily responsible 

for  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  of  its  department.  If  any  fraudulent  activity  is  detected,  the  management  of 

the relevant department shall improve the control procedures promptly to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The risk 

management and internal control departments have dedicated a team to each business group to provide internal control and 

risk management support. We also apply continuous auditing to key businesses in order to detect irregularities and identify 

risks in a timely and systematic manner and to improve the effectiveness of fraud risk management and control.

Sunshine Code and Anti-Corruption Trainings

All employees of the entire Group are required to follow and to strictly comply with the Sunshine Code. It expressly prohibits 

all  kinds  of  fraudulent  activities,  bribery,  embezzlement,  misappropriation  of  company’s  assets,  extortion,  falsification  of 

information and any other activities which are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Sunshine Code shall 

be reviewed annually against the changing needs of the Group and revised when appropriate, in order to ensure that it caters 

for our business development, reflects the positions under applicable laws and regulations and captures all kinds of fraudulent 

activities  effectively.  To  ensure  that  our  employees  comply  with  the  requirements  and  ethics  stipulated  in  the  Sunshine 

Code, we have made a learning video as a compulsory course for new employees according to the Sunshine Code’s specific 

provisions and the real cases in the past. If there are significant changes in the Sunshine Code’s content, we will also ask all 

employees of the Group to retake the course in time. We ensure that all employees understand Sunshine Code’s provisions 

and that 100% of our employees receive anti-corruption training. At the same time, we also require 100% of our suppliers to 

abide by the Company’s business ethics and anti-corruption etc. requirements in the Sunshine Code and jointly safeguard the 

cooperation foundation of legal, fair and equitable trade. Employees at high-risk positions participate in face-to-face Sunshine 

Code  training  courses.  They  learn  real  cases  to  acquire  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  requirements  of  national  laws  and 

regulations and the Sunshine Code to avoid the risk of corruption. In 2020, six directors participated in the Audit Committee 

meeting,  internal  audit  committee  meeting  and  other  internal  meetings  to  learn  Tencent’s  risk  management  and  internal 

control policies, anti-fraud policies and measures, anti-corruption related laws and regulations and Sunshine Code, as well as 

the internal corruption cases. In addition, we will regularly push pictures and short videos to ensure that our staff can keep up 

with the requirements of anti-fraud laws and regulations.

Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy

We have published an Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy (the “Whistleblowing Policy”), which clearly conveys the message 

of  our  zero  tolerance  in  relation  to  fraudulent  activity  to  all  the  employees  and  suppliers/business  partners.  All  employees 

and suppliers/business partners are encouraged by the Group to report genuine concerns about any existing or potentially 

fraudulent activities and non-compliance. The Whistleblowing Policy expressly outlines the multiple whistleblowing channels, 

how the Group should deal with such concerns and the whistle-blower protection system, so that employees and suppliers/

business partners can report their good faith concerns without fear of reprisal or potential retaliation. Since 2016, we have 

maintained  an  official  account  under  the  name  of  “Sunshine  Tencent”  on  Weixin  to  promote  our  anti-fraud  policy  and 

whistleblowing channels with a function to allow our business partners to report directly to us.

143

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEmployees  and  suppliers/business  partners  can  also  report  other  violations  through  this  open  channel,  including  but  not 

limited to employees’ misconduct, deception, disclosure of trade secrets or other violations of business ethics. We encourage 

the informants to leave their contact information for the follow-up investigation and inform the informants of the investigation’s 

progress and handling promptly. At the same time, we also guarantee that anonymous reports that provide adequate reporting 

information will also be dealt with seriously. We guarantee to protect the informant’s identity or information from disclosure and 

take measures to protect the informant from retaliation.

Fraud Detection and Corruption Prevention

When  suspected  fraudulent  activities  are  discovered  or  when  a  report  of  suspected  fraudulent  activities  is  received,  the 

anti-fraud  investigation  department,  which  consists  of  professionals  who  used  to  be  part  of  the  anti-corruption  function  at 

a  governmental  authority  or  private  enterprise  and  have  profound  knowledge  in  fraud  risk  management  and  solid  fraud 

investigation experiences, is assigned to handle the investigation independently. After an investigation has been completed, 

the employee found and proven to have committed serious fraud shall be subject to immediate dismissal. At the same time, 

the department in question must, with the assistance of the risk management and internal control departments, take corrective 

actions in response to the business risk or loophole identified during the investigation. If we find any supplier or business 

partner engaging in serious corruption or any other fraudulent activities, we will terminate the contracts with them immediately 

and will never conduct business with them. In the event that any fraudulent activity violates any relevant laws or regulations, 

such cases shall be reported to relevant government authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2020, 

we received the results of the five corruption cases that we transferred to the authorities. Five former employees involved (timely 

dismissed according to the Sunshine Code) were found to be in violation of Article 163 of the Criminal Law of the People’s 

Republic of China on “bribery of non-state workers” and Article 271 on “duty embezzlement”, with the criminal punishment 

ranging from four months’ detention to thirteen years’ imprisonment. Because these cases were discovered and handled in 

time, they did not significantly impact the Company’s business. After the occurrence of these cases, the direct and indirect 

managers of the employees involved bore the consequences, including demotion, cancellation of merit rating, and reprimand 

according to the Sunshine Code. Meanwhile, the relevant departments have also taken effective internal control measures to 

prevent similar cases from happening again.

In  2020,  we  issued  the  Management  Policy  for  Sensitive  Positions  (the “Management  Policy”)  to  better  implement  the 

corporate  governance  standards  and  supervision  requirements  of  risk  management  and  internal  control,  and  strengthen 

the  construction  of  the  Company’s  integrity  system.  The  Management  Policy  provides  that  positions  which  participate  in 

supplies/services/resources procurement, marketing, channel sales and resource management involving external cooperation, 

evaluation  and selection of potential partners, pricing, resource  allocation, key  decision  making  and  other  high-risk  duties 

should  be  regarded  as  sensitive  positions.  Corresponding  management  measures  are  taken  for  these  positions,  including 

requiring regular job rotation, stripping sensitive responsibilities, participating in various risk management training for sensitive 

positions etc. The Management Policy also clearly stipulates that the IA reserves the right to audit all personnel in sensitive 

positions and may conduct audit on current or former personnel in sensitive positions from time to time. 

144

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportIn order to convey a message regarding our determination to fight against fraud and to introduce our Whistleblowing Policy 

externally, we send a letter to our suppliers and business partners and request them to complete a questionnaire annually 

since 2015. The questionnaire sets out our corporate values, the Whistleblowing Policy and the various reporting channels. 

We will understand from each of our suppliers and our business partners whether our employees have requested any gift, 

cash or benefit during the course of business and whether they have been treated unfairly. Upon receipt of the feedback, we 

will ensure that the questions or concerns raised by our suppliers and our business partners will be addressed promptly. If 

necessary, the anti-fraud investigation department will commence an investigation formally.

Our risk management and internal control departments have established a procurement management control unit to optimise 

the Group’s supplier management system. Through the centralised system, the bidding process can be standardised and more 

transparent. The supplier management system also provides communication channels for suppliers to collect their feedback or 

complaints. Fraud complaints will be directly referred to the anti-fraud investigation department for follow-up. The Group aims 

to ensure that suppliers’ complaints and concerns can be resolved in a timely manner and to minimise the risk of fraud.

Anti-money Laundering

The Group strictly abides by applicable laws and regulations in relation to cross-border and domestic money transmission, 

anti-money laundering (“AML”), counter-terrorist financing (“CTF”), as well as anti-tax evasion in the PRC and other countries 

where  we  provide  payment  processing  services.  Specifically,  according  to  the Anti-Money Laundering Law of the People’s 

Republic of China implemented on 1 January 2007 and the Administrative Measures for Non-financial Institutions Providing 

Payment Services implemented on 1 September 2010 and revised on 29 April 2020, we must formulate AML measures, fulfil 

AML obligations, and comply with relevant AML regulations if we intend to provide users with third-party payment services. 

According to the Administrative Measures for Anti-money Laundering and Anti-terrorism Financing of Payment Institutions 

promulgated and implemented on 5 March 2012, payment institutions should establish and improve a unified internal control 

system for AML, and report it to the branch of the People’s Bank of China where the headquarters are located and should set 

up a special institution or designate an internal institution to be responsible for AML and CTF.

As a result of the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance in multiple jurisdictions, we have established an independent 

AML and sanctions compliance department. The duty of the department is to coordinate the management of money laundering 

and sanctions risk at the group level for all businesses, to fulfil AML and sanctions requirements  under relevant laws and 

regulations, and to manage and promote the implementation of various AML and sanctions initiatives.

In 2020, we strictly enforced the AML provisions of the regulatory authorities, further strengthened our compliance capacity, 

and orderly promoted all works under the framework of the Group’s minimum standards for AML and sanctions compliance. 

Key aspects of the AML programme include but are not limited to the followings:

• 

To sort out and clarify the six major systems of AML management, including risk governance, risk assessment, control, 

system, identification and transaction monitoring;

• 

Strictly implement the Group’s minimum standards for AML and sanctions compliance;

145

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance Report• 

Regularly hold money laundering risk management committee meetings to continuously promote senior executives to 

perform their duties;

• 

To carry out institution money laundering risk assessment projects, optimise and improve assessment indicators and 

methodologies, and comprehensively evaluate institution’s money laundering risk, in order to optimise the allocation of 

AML resources and enhance management standards.

In addition, the Group continues to improve the AML programme and dedicate increasing resources to the following key areas: 

(i) increase staffing and provide regular on-the-job and professional training for employees to improve the strength of AML 

professional team continuously; (ii) consolidate the system to achieve comprehensive coverage of regulatory requirements; (iii) 

regularly carry out special assessments to strengthen the implementation of AML and sanctions compliance system and rules, 

including customer and product money laundering risk assessment, transaction monitoring and suspicious transaction report 

compliance assessment and list system inspection; (iv) deepen cooperation with authorities and practise the idea of technology 

for the good; (v) active participation in international AML/CTF events to exchange industry best practices.

procedures  with  respect  to  earlier  periods  or  any  other  elements  included  in  the  2020  ESG  report  and,  therefore,  do  not 

express any conclusion thereon.

CRITERIA

The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Selected ESG Information is set out in the sections headed “Application of 

Reporting Principles” and “Reporting Boundary of this Report” in the 2020 ESG report (the “Criteria”).

THE COMPANY’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTED ESG INFORMATION

The  Company  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  Selected  ESG  Information  in  accordance  with  the  Criteria.  This 

responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of Selected 

ESG Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS

The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 

allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.

152

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportOUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional 

Accountants  (including  International  Independence  Standards)  issued  by  the  International  Ethics  Standards  Board  for 

Accountants,  which  is  founded  on  fundamental  principles  of  integrity,  objectivity,  professional  competence  and  due  care, 

confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 

control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards 

and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected ESG Information based on the procedures we 

have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with 

International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 

Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires 

that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected ESG Information is free 

from material misstatement.

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as 

the basis for the preparation of the Selected ESG Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Selected ESG 

Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating 

the overall presentation of the Selected ESG Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a 

reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 

control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.

The procedures we performed were based on our  professional  judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 

performed,  inspection  of  documents,  analytical  procedures,  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  quantification  methods  and 

reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:

• 

obtained an understanding of the ESG governance structure, ESG strategy and stakeholder engagement process;

• 

made inquiries of the personnel involved in the preparation of the ESG report regarding the preparation process and the 

internal control system relating to this process;

153

Annual Report 2020Environmental, Social and Governance Report• 

understood the process for collecting and reporting the Selected ESG Information. This included visiting the Company’s 

corporate head office in Shenzhen, 2 office buildings  and  2 data centres  (which were selected  on  the basis of their 

inherent risk and materiality to the Company, “Selected Sites”), understanding the key data collection processes and 

controls at the Selected Sites and analysing the relevant data collected;

• 

performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis and analytical procedures of the Selected ESG Information at 

the Selected Sites to substantiate the data is appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and

• 

considered the disclosure and presentation of the ESG report prepared in accordance with underlying records and the 

ESG Reporting Guide, Appendix 27 to the Main Board Listing Rules by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 

a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 

substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 

Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s Selected ESG Information has 

been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

LIMITED ASSURANCE CONCLUSION

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 

causes us to believe that the Company’s Selected ESG Information for the year ended 31 December 2020 is not prepared, in 

all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of directors of the Company and for no other purpose. We do not 

assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the content of this report.

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportOTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

161

Annual Report 2020Independent Auditor’s ReportAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

• 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

• 

Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

162

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

Tencent Holdings LimitedConsolidated Statement of Cash FlowsFor the year ended 31 December 20201 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  Value-added  Services  (“VAS”),  Online  Advertising  services  and  FinTech  and 

Business Services.

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable the Company to own and control 

the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited 

(“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 February 2000.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer; and

• 

the right to control the management, financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

175

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20201 

GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.3(a) and Note 47) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 47.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or 

loss (“FVPL”), financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”), certain other financial 

assets and liabilities, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 

are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.2  Changes in accounting policies

Change in the subsequent measurement of put option arrangements with non-controlling shareholders

From 1 January 2020, the Group made voluntary change in accounting policy on the subsequent measurement 

of put option arrangements with non-controlling shareholders from the change in carrying value “through profit 

or loss” to “through equity”. The Group considers the change in the accounting policy will provide more relevant 

information  about  the  effects  of  underlying  transactions  which  is  related  to  transaction  with  non-controlling 

shareholders that do not result in any change in the status of an existing subsidiary. The Group has adopted this 

new policy retrospectively, however as the impact is insignificant to the consolidated financial statements of the 

Group, comparative figures have not been restated. The adoption of this new policy also does not result in any 

significant financial impact for the year ended 31 December 2020.

2.3  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  where  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 

consideration  arrangement,  which  is  recognised  under  “other  financial  assets”  or  “other  financial 

liabilities”  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and 

contingent consideration assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 

at the acquisition date.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.3  Subsidiaries (continued)

(a)  Consolidation (continued)

(i) 

Business combinations (continued)

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as 

equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.3  Subsidiaries (continued)

(a)  Consolidation (continued)

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or financial asset. In 

addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 47(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.4  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally 

but  not  necessarily  accompanying  a  shareholding  of  between  20%  and  50%  of  the  voting  rights.  Investments 

in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 

Group’s investments in associates include underlying goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated 

impairment loss.

180

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.4  Associates (continued)

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in  the 

carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  Where  the  Group’s  share  of  losses  in  an  associate  equals  or  exceeds  its 

interests  in  the  associate,  including  any  other  unsecured  long-term  receivables,  the  Group  does  not  recognise 

further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including investments in associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.5), are impaired. 

If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference  between  the  recoverable 

amount of the investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the 

consolidated income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

2.5  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. Where the Group’s  share of losses in a  joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in 

the joint venture (which includes any other unsecured long-term receivables that, in substance, form part of the 

Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

181

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.5  Joint arrangements (continued)

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interests  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.6 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The cost of associates/joint ventures acquired in stages, except for the change from an associate to a joint venture, 

is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interests  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any  additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interests is taken to the consolidated income statement.

2.7  Disposal of associates

When the Group loses significant influence over an associate, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A 

gain or loss is recognised at any difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus any proceeds from 

disposing part of the interests in the associate and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity 

method of accounting was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income by an 

associate should be reclassified to the consolidated income statement or transferred to another category of equity 

as specified and permitted by applicable IFRSs when the Group loses significant influence over the associate.

2.8  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.9  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange 

rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried 

at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-

monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss 

are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation 

differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equity instruments classified as FVOCI, are included 

in other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.9  Foreign currency translation (continued)

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income  statement are  translated at  average  exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 

taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.10 Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the reporting period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings

Computer and other operating equipment

Furniture and office equipment

Motor vehicles

Leasehold improvements

20 ~ 50 years

2 ~ 10 years

2 ~ 5 years

5 years

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease term

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction costs less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.15).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

185

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.11 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.12 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease.

2.13 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  represents  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred 

plus acquisition-date fair value of the equity interests previously held by the Group and the non-controlling 

interests in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately under “Other gains/(losses), net” and is not subsequently reversed.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.13 Intangible assets (continued)

(b)  Media contents

Media contents mainly include game licenses, video and music contents, and literature copyrights. They are 

initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value as acquired through business combinations. 

Media  contents  are  amortised  using  a  straight-line  method  or  an  accelerated  method  which  reflects  the 

estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include trademarks, other copyrights, computer software and technology, non-

compete agreements and land with indefinite useful life. They are initially recognised and measured at cost 

or estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Land with indefinite useful life is not subject to amortisation and impairment reviews are undertaken annually 

or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Other intangible 

assets  are  amortised  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  (generally  one  to  ten  years)  using  the  straight-line 

method which reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be 

consumed.

2.14 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 47(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might 

be impaired. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 

carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 

costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 

which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill 

that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.16 Investments and other financial assets

(a)  Classification and measurement

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

• 

those  to  be  measured  subsequently  at  fair  value  (either  through  other  comprehensive  income,  or 

through profit or loss); and

• 

those to be measured at amortised cost.

The  classification  depends  on  the  entity’s  business  model  for  managing  the  financial  assets  and  the 

contractual terms of the cash flows.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 

asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 

of  the  financial  asset.  Transaction  costs  of  financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are 

expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 

cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Debt instruments

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group’s business model 

for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three categories 

into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

• 

Amortised cost: Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash 

flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are classified as and measured at amortised 

cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment measured at amortised cost which is not part of a hedging 

relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income 

from these financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

• 

FVOCI:  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  and  for  selling  the 

financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are 

classified  as  and  measured  at  FVOCI.  Movements  in  the  carrying  amount  of  these  financial  assets 

are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the  recognition of impairment losses  or 

reversals,  interest  income  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or 

loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in “Other gains/

(losses),  net”  in  the  consolidated  income  statement.  Interest  income  from  these  financial  assets  is 

recognised using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented 

in “finance costs, net” and impairment losses or reversals are presented in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

• 

FVPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are classified as and 

measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  debt  investment  measured  at  fair 

value through profit or loss which is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and 

presented in “Other gains/(losses), net” for the period in which it arises.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets 

changes.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Equity instruments

The Group initially recognises and subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Upon initial 

recognition,  the  Group’s  management  can  elect  to  classify  irrevocably  its  equity  investments  as  financial 

assets at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity instrument under IAS 32 and are not held for trading. 

The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Where  the  Group  has  made  an  irrevocable  election  to  present  fair  value  gains  and  losses  on  equity 

investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and 

losses  to  profit  or  loss  following  the  derecognition  of  the  investments.  Dividends  from  such  investments 

continue to be recognised in profit or loss as “Other gains/(losses), net” when the Group’s right to receive 

payments is established. Equity instruments designated as FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

FVPL  include  financial  assets  designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and 

financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI. Changes in the fair value of FVPL 

are recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

(b) 

Impairment

The  Group  assesses  on  a  forward-looking  basis  the  expected  credit  losses  associated  with  its  debt 

instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether 

there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, 

which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised since initial recognition.

Impairment on deposits and other receivables is  measured  as either 12-month  expected credit losses  or 

lifetime expected credit losses, depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 

since initial recognition. If a significant increase in credit risk of a deposit or receivable has occurred since 

initial recognition, the impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.

2.17 Derivative and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive 

and  as  financial  liabilities  when  the  fair  value  is  negative,  which  are  recognised  under “other  financial  assets” 

and “other financial liabilities” in the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The method of recognising 

the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 

nature of the item being hedged.

The  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  as  hedges  of  a  particular  risk  associated  with  the  cash  flows  of  a 

recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges). The Group documents 

at the inception of the hedging relationship the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 

items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The 

Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the 

inception of each hedge relationship.

A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the hedge effectiveness requirements under 

IFRS 9. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 

flow  hedges  is  recognised  through  other  comprehensive  income  within  equity,  while  any  ineffective  portion  is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss, within “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in the 

cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item 

are recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.17 Derivative and hedging activities (continued)

Amounts accumulated in equity are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, 

as follows:

• 

Where  the  hedged  item  subsequently  results  in  the  recognition  of  a  non-financial  asset,  the  amounts 

accumulated  in  equity  are  removed  from  other  reserves  and  included  within  the  initial  cost  of  the  asset. 

These deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss.

• 

For  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  effective  portion  of  the  derivatives  is 

reclassified to profit or loss at the same time when the hedged cash flows affects profit or loss.

When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 

hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remain 

in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 

cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging included in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or 

loss.

2.18 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and  there  is  an intention  to 

settle on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 

must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in certain 

circumstances, such as default, insolvency, bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

2.19 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily  accounted for  using  the  weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

192

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.20 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.21 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents mainly include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term 

highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

The Group does not recognise cash amounts deposited with banks in the Mainland of China (which are received 

under its payment business) under users’ entrustment in the consolidated statement of financial position as the 

Group holds these cash amounts as a custodian according to the relevant users’ agreements.

2.22 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  Group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  instruments,  the  consideration  paid,  including 

any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 

as  treasury  shares  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued, 

any  consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

193

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.23 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair  value and subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the 

effective interest method.

2.24 Put option arrangements on non-controlling interest

Put options on non-controlling interest of the Group are financial instruments granted by the Group which permit 

the holders to put back to the Group their shares in certain non wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group for cash or 

other financial instruments when certain conditions are met. If the Group does not have the unconditional right to 

avoid delivering cash or other financial instruments under the put option, a financial liability is initially recognised 

under “other financial liabilities” in the consolidated  financial statements at the present  value of  the estimated 

future cash outflows on exercise under the put option. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates of payments, 

the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised  estimated  cash 

outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount based on the present value of revised estimated future 

cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the adjustment will be recognised in 

the consolidated statement of changes in equity. In the event that the put option expires unexercised, the liability is 

derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option first becomes exercisable 12 months after the 

end of the reporting period.

2.25 Borrowings, notes payable and borrowing costs

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their terms using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan facilities to the 

extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 

draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 

down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the term of the facility to 

which it relates.

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.25 Borrowings, notes payable and borrowing costs (continued)

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition and  construction  of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 

added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 

sale. During the year ended 31 December 2020, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.26 Current and deferred income tax

The income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax, which is recognised in the consolidated 

income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 

in equity. In this case, the income tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority 

will  accept  an  uncertain  tax  treatment.  The  Group  measures  its  tax  balances  either  based  on  the  most  likely 

amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the 

uncertainty.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  However, 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 

a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable 

profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 

substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax 

asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to 

utilise those temporary differences and tax losses.

195

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.26 Current and deferred income tax (continued)

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the 

Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally, the 

Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only when there is an agreement 

in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, 

deferred tax liability in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from the associate’s undistributed profit is 

not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied 

by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 

settle the balances on a net basis.

2.27 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they are accrued to employees. A provision is 

made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end 

of the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time 

of leave.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.27 Employee benefits (continued)

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate fund. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior years. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants  as  consideration  for  equity  instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of 

the Group. The fair value of the employee services and other qualifying participants’ services received in 

exchange  for  the  grant  of  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  is  recognised  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting 

period, i.e. the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied and credited to 

equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 

the  options  granted  by  using  option-pricing  model, “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the “Binomial 

Model”), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) 

but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award 

shares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s 

shares at the grant date. The Group also adopts valuation techniques to assess the fair value of other equity 

instruments of the Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.27 Employee benefits (continued)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (continued)

From the perspective of the Company, the grants of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries are 

made in exchange for their services related to the subsidiaries. Accordingly, the share-based compensation 

expenses are treated as part of the “Investments in subsidiaries” or “other receivables” in the Company’s 

statement of financial position.

At each reporting period end, the Group revises the estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 

consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

If  the  Group  repurchases  vested  equity  instruments,  the  payments  made  to  the  employees  and  other 

qualifying  participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the 

payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. 

Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense is  recognised for any  modification that increases  the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

Cash-settled share-based payment transactions are those arrangements which the terms provide the Group 

to settle the transaction in cash. Upon the satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the Group shall account for 

that transaction as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction if, and to the extent that, the Group has 

incurred a liability to settle in cash.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised 

at the current fair value determined at the end of the reporting period. The Group adopts valuation technique 

to assess the fair value of such equity instruments granted under the share-based compensation plans as 

appropriate.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.28 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.29 Revenue recognition

The Group generates revenues primarily from provision of VAS, Online Advertising services, FinTech and Business 

Services,  and  other  online  related  services  in  the  PRC.  Revenue  is  recognised  when  the  control  of  the  goods 

or services is transferred to a customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the 

contract, control of the goods and services may be transferred over time or at a point in time.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  primarily  include  revenues  from  the  provision  of  online  games  and  social  networks 

services. Online games revenues are mainly derived from sales of in-game virtual items, and social networks 

revenues  are  mainly  derived  from  sales  of  virtual  items  such  as  VAS  subscriptions  across  various  online 

platforms, and games revenues attributable to social networks business. The Group offers virtual items to 

users on the Group’s online platforms. The VAS fees are paid directly by end users mainly via online payment 

channels.

Revenue from VAS is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services. 

Giving there is an explicit or implicit obligation of the Group to maintain the virtual items operated on the 

Group’s platforms and allow users to gain access to them, revenue is recognised over the estimated lifespans 

of  the  respective  virtual  items.  The  estimated  lifespans  of  different  virtual  items  are  determined  by  the 

management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the 

relevant virtual items depending on the respective term of virtual items.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.29 Revenue recognition (continued)

(a)  VAS (continued)

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to 

each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the 

prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

In respect of the Group’s VAS services directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various 

third-party platforms, these third-party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Online Service Fees”) 

on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of platform provider fees (as 

part of “Channel and distribution costs”). Such Channel and distribution costs are withheld and deducted 

from  the  gross  Online  Service  Fees  collected  by  these  platforms  from  the  users,  with  the  net  amounts 

remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Online Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis, given it 

acts as the principal in these transactions based on the assessment according to the criteria stated in (e) 

below, and recognises such Channel and distribution costs as cost of revenues.

The  Group  also  opens  its  online  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  under  certain  co-

operation  agreements,  of  which  the  Group  pays  to  the  third-party  game/application  developers  a  pre-

determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from the users of the Group’s online platforms for 

the virtual items purchased. The Group recognises the related revenue on a gross or net basis depending on 

whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. The Group adopts different revenue 

recognition methods based on its specific responsibilities/obligations in different VAS offerings.

(b)  Online Advertising

Online Advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from media advertisements and from social 

and others advertisements, depending on the placement of advertising properties and inventories.

Advertising contracts are signed to establish the prices and advertising services to be provided based on 

different arrangements, including display-based advertising that are display of ads for an agreed period of 

time, and performance-based advertising that are based on actual performance measurement.

2.29 Revenue recognition (continued)

(b)  Online Advertising (continued)

Revenue  from  display-based  advertising  is  recognised  on  number  of  display/impression  basis  or  their 

advertising agencies depending on the contractual measures. Revenue from performance-based advertising 

is  recognised  when  relevant  specific  performance  measures  are  fulfilled.  Where  the  contracts  include 

multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation 

on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the prices charged to or expected 

to recover from customers.

(c)  FinTech and Business Services

FinTech and Business Services revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from provision of FinTech and 

cloud services.

FinTech  service  revenues  mainly  include  commissions  from  payment,  wealth  management  and  other 

FinTech services, which is generally determined as a percentage based on the value of transaction amount 

or  retention  amount.  Revenue  related  to  such  commissions  is  recognised  upon  a  time  when  the  Group 

satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services.

Cloud services are mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. For cloud service contracts 

billed based on a fixed amount for a specified service period, revenue is recognised over the subscribed 

period when the services are delivered to customers. For cloud service provided on a consumption basis, 

revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  customer  utilisation  of  the  resources.  When  a  cloud-based  service 

includes multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance 

obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the prices charged to 

or expected to recover from customers.

2.29 Revenue recognition (continued)

(d)  Other revenues

The Group’s other revenues are primarily derived from production of and distribution of, films and television 

programmes for third parties, copyrights licensing, merchandise sales and various other activities. The Group 

recognises other revenues when the respective services are rendered, or when the control of the products 

are transferred to customers.

(e)  Principal agent consideration

The  Group  reports  the  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  depending  on  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  a 

principal or an agent in a transaction. The Group is a principal if it controls the specified product or service 

before that product or service is transferred to a customer or it has a right to direct others to provide the 

product or service to the customer on the Group’s behalf. Indicators that the Group is a principal include 

but are not limited to whether the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in 

establishing the selling price; (iii) has discretion in supplier selection; (iv) changes the product or performs 

part of the service, and (v) has involvement in the determination of product or service specifications.

(f) 

Contract liabilities and contract costs

A contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group 

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. The Group’s contract 

liabilities  mainly  comprise  virtual  items,  unamortised  pre-paid  tokens  or  cards,  Internet  traffic  and  other 

support to be offered to certain investee companies in the future periods measured at their fair value on the 

inception dates, and customer loyalty incentives offered to the customers (Note 5(c)).

Contract  costs  include  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  costs  to  fulfil  a  contract  with  the 

customers.  The  contract  costs  are  amortised  using  a  method  which  is  consistent  with  the  pattern  of 

recognition of the respective revenues.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.30 Interest income

Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial 

asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 

the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss 

allowance). Interest income is presented as “Interest income” where it is mainly earned from financial assets that 

are held for cash management purposes.

2.31 Dividend income

Dividends  are  received  from  FVPL  and  FVOCI.  Dividends  are  recognised  in  “Other  gains/(losses),  net”  in  the 

consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established. This applies even if they are paid 

out of pre-acquisition profits, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment. 

In this case, the dividend is recognised in other comprehensive income if it relates to an investment measured at 

FVOCI. However, the investment may need to be tested for impairment as a consequence.

2.32 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

and expenses which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.33 Leases

The  Group  leases  land  (Note  2.12),  various  buildings,  computer  and  other  operating  equipment  and  others. 

Rental contracts other than land are typically made for fixed periods of no longer than 10 years. Lease terms are 

negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements 

do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

A lease is recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset 

is  available  for  use  by  the  Group.  Each  lease  payment  is  allocated  between  the  liability  and  finance  cost.  The 

finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest 

on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of 

the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. A right-of-use asset arising from land lease is 

presented as “land use rights”.

203

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.33 Leases (continued)

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include 

the net present value of the following lease payments:

• 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

• 

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;

• 

amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

• 

the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

• 

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease.  If  that  rate  cannot  be  readily 

determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, 

being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of 

similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

• 

where  possible,  uses  recent  third-party  financing  received  by  the  individual  lessee  as  a  starting  point, 

adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;

• 

uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by 

the Group, which does not have recent third-party financing; and

• 

makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.

If a readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent financing or market 

data) which has a similar payment profile to the lease, then the Group entities use that rate as a starting point to 

determine the incremental borrowing rate.

204

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20202 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.33 Leases (continued)

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 

the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 

each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

• 

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

• 

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

• 

any initial direct costs; and

• 

restoration costs.

A  right-of-use  asset  is  generally  depreciated  over  the  shorter  of  the  asset’s  useful  life  and  the  lease  term  on  a 

straight-line  basis.  If  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  a  purchase  option,  the  right-of-use  asset  is 

depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. 

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less without a purchase option.

The  Group  considers  the  lease  as  a  single  transaction  in  which  the  assets  and  liabilities  are  integrally  linked. 

There is no net temporary difference at inception. Subsequently, when differences on settlement of the liabilities 

and the amortisation of right-of-use assets arise, there will be a net temporary difference on which deferred tax is 

recognised.

2.34 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.35 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk 

and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise 

the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out by the 

management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency  exposures,  primarily  with  respect  to  Hong  Kong  Dollars  (“HKD”),  USD  and  Euro  (“EUR”). 

Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  when  future  commercial  transactions  or  recognised  assets  and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

subsidiaries. The functional currency of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures.

in the consolidated income statement.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (continued)

As at 31 December 2020, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange 

rates  of  the  above  currencies  against  the  two  major  functional  currencies  would  not  result  in  a 

significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities 

denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency are considered 

to be not significant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.

(ii)  Price risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  mainly  arising  from  investments  held  by  the  Group  that 

are  classified  either  as  FVPL  (Note  24)  or  FVOCI  (Note  25).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from 

the investments, the Group diversifies its investment portfolio.  The investments are  made either for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity  analysis  is  performed  by  management  to  assess  the  exposure  of  the  Group’s  financial 

results  to  equity  price  risk  of  FVPL  and  FVOCI  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  If  prices  of  the 

respective  instruments  held  by  the  Group  had  been  5%  (31  December  2019:  5%)  higher/lower  as 

at 31 December 2020, profit for the year would have been approximately RMB8,326 million (2019: 

RMB6,611  million)  higher/lower  as  a  result  of  gains/losses  on  financial  instruments  classified  as  at 

FVPL,  other  comprehensive  income  would  have  been  approximately  RMB10,529  million  (2019: 

RMB4,018  million)  higher/lower  as  a  result  of  gains/losses  on  financial  instruments  classified  as  at 

FVOCI.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 26, 29 and 31.

If the interest rate of term deposits with initial terms of over three months had been 50 basis points 

higher/lower, the profit before income tax for the year ended 31 December  2020  would have  been 

RMB501 million (2019: RMB330 million) higher/lower. If the interest rate of cash and cash equivalents 

had been 50 basis points higher/lower, the profit before income tax for the year ended 31 December 

2020 would have been RMB764 million (2019: RMB665 million) higher/lower.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 35 and 36, representing a substantial portion 

of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group to cash 

flow interest-rate risk whereas those carried at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate 

risk.

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

The  Group  entered  into  certain  interest  rate  swap  contracts  to  hedge  its  exposure  arising  from 

borrowings and senior notes carried at floating rates. Under these interest  rate swap contracts, the 

Group  agreed  with  the  counterparties  to  exchange,  at  specified  interval,  the  difference  between 

fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional 

amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings and 

senior notes from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified for hedge accounting. Details of the 

Group’s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2020 have been mainly disclosed 

in Note 38.

As  at  31  December  2020  and  2019,  management  considered  that  any  reasonable  changes  in  the 

interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to 

cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after 

considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is 

presented for interest rate risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, accounts receivable, other receivables, as well as short-term investments measured at amortised 

cost,  at  FVOCI  and  at  FVPL.  The  carrying  amount  of  each  class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the 

Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

The majority of the balances of accounts receivable are due from online advertising customers and agencies, 

content production related customers, FinTech and cloud customers and third party platform providers. To 

manage the risk arising from accounts receivable, the Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues 

of credit terms are made to counterparties with an appropriate credit history and the management performs 

ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties. The credit periods granted to these customers are disclosed 

in Note 30 and the credit quality of these customers is assessed, which takes into account their financial 

position, past experience and other factors. The Group has a large number of customers and there is no 

significant concentration of credit risk.

Other receivables are mainly comprised of receivables related to financial services, interest receivables, loans 

to investees and investees’ shareholders, lease deposits and other receivables. Management manages the 

loans  by  category,  makes  periodic  assessments  as  well  as  individual  assessment  on  the  recoverability  of 

other receivables based on historical settlement records and past experience.

For financial assets whose impairment losses are measured using expected credit loss (“ECL”) model, the 

Group assesses whether their credit risk has increased significantly since their initial recognition, and applies 

a three-stage impairment model to calculate their impairment allowance and recognise their ECL, as follows:

– 

Stage 1: If the credit risk has not increased significantly since its initial recognition, the financial asset 

is included in stage 1.

– 

Stage 2: If the credit risk has increased significantly since its initial recognition but not yet deemed to 

be credit-impaired, the financial instrument is included in stage 2.

– 

Stage 3: If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is included in stage 3.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

The Group considers the credit risk characteristics of different financial  instruments when  determining  if 

there is significant increase in credit risk. For financial instruments with or without significant increase in 

credit risk, lifetime or 12-month expected credit losses are provided respectively.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been 

a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each of the years. To assess whether 

there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares risk of a default occurring on the assets as 

at year end with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Especially the following indicators are 

incorporated:

• 

internal credit rating;

• 

external credit rating (as far as available);

• 

actual  or  expected  significant  adverse  changes  in  business,  financial  economic  conditions  that  are 

expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;

• 

actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty; and

• 

significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the counterparty, including changes 

in the payment status of the counterparty.

(i) 

Credit risk of cash and deposits

To  manage  this  risk,  the  Group  only  makes  transactions  with  state-owned  banks  and  financial 

institutions in the PRC and reputable international banks and financial institutions outside of the PRC. 

There has been no recent history of default in relation to these banks and financial institutions. The 

expected credit loss is close to zero.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 

9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all accounts receivable. In view of 

the sound financial position and collection history of receivables due from these counterparties and 

insignificant  risk  of  default,  to  measure  the  expected  credit  losses,  accounts  receivable  have  been 

grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The  expected  loss  rates  are  based  on  the  payment  profiles  of  revenue  over  12  months  before  31 

December  2020  and  the  corresponding  historical  credit  losses  experienced  within  this  period,  or 

probability  of  a  receivable  progressing  through  successive  stages  of  delinquency  to  write-off.  The 

historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic 

factors (such as the GDP of the countries in which it sells its goods and services) affecting the ability of 

the customers to settle the receivables.

A default on accounts receivable is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 

90  days  when  they  fall  due.  Accounts  receivable  are  written  off,  in  whole  or  in  part,  when  it  has 

exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of 

recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the 

failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan within the Group, and a failure to make contractual 

payments for a period of greater than 3 years past due.

Impairment losses on accounts receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating 

profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same item.

(iii)  Credit risk of other receivables

Management considers the credit risk of other receivables is insignificant when they have a low risk of 

default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near 

term, and the loss allowance recognised is therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. In view 

of insignificant risk of default and credit risk since initial recognition, management believes that the 

expected credit loss under the 12 months expected losses method is immaterial.

Liquidity risk

The Group aims to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and readily marketable securities, which 

are  classified  as  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  the 

underlying businesses, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining adequate balances of such.

The  table  below  analyses  the  Group’s  financial  liabilities  by  relevant  maturity  groupings  based  on  the

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital  refers  to  equity  and  external  debts  (including  borrowings  and  notes  payable).  In  order  to  maintain  or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The  Group  assesses  its  creditworthiness  based  on  business  and  financial  risk  profile  and  monitors  capital  by 

regularly reviewing debts to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) 

ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflects financial health and liquidity position. 

The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Borrowings (Note 35)

Notes payable (Note 36)

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

• 

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined  with reference to quoted market 

prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly 

available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices 

represent  actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.  These  instruments  are 

included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include:

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

• 

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

Valuation processes inputs and relationships to fair value (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who performs valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. The 

team performs valuation, or necessary updates, at least once every quarter, which coincides with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  team  adopts  various  valuation  techniques  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  Group’s  level  3 

instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and consulted when it is necessary.

The components of the level 3 instruments mainly include investments in unlisted companies classified as FVPL or FVOCI, other 

financial assets, and other financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities mainly include contingent consideration payable related 

to certain business combinations. As these investments and instruments are not traded in an active market, majority of their 

fair values have been determined using applicable valuation techniques including comparable transactions approach and other 

option pricing approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgments, assumptions and inputs, including risk-free

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

Note: (continued)

For contingent consideration related to a business combination of a company, which is principally engaged in the television series 

and film production business, the significant unobservable inputs are growth rate of net profit and expected volatility, which are 

15% (31 December 2019: 35%) and 35% (31 December 2019: 25%), respectively. The higher the growth rate, the higher the 

fair value; and the higher the expected volatility, the lower the fair value.

For the fair value of the Group’s investments in unlisted companies, the sensitivity analysis is performed by management, see 

Note 3.1(a)(ii) for details.

For the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combination, if growth rate of net profit had been 5% higher 

or lower as at 31 December 2020, the fair value would have increased approximately RMB73 million (2019: RMB65 million) 

or decreased approximately RMB97 million (2019: RMB66 million). If the expected volatility had been 5% higher or lower as 

at 31 December 2020, the fair value would have decreased approximately RMB66 million (2019: RMB34 million) or increased 

approximately RMB66 million (2019: RMB25 million).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual items provided on the Group’s online platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.29(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  items  provided  on  the  Group’s  online 

platforms  and  the  relevant  revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  estimated  lifespans  of  the  virtual  items.  The 

estimated lifespans of different virtual items are determined by the management based on either the expected 

users’  relationship  periods  or  the  stipulated  period  of  validity  of  the  relevant  virtual  items  depending  on  the 

respective terms of virtual items.

221

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20204 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual items provided on the Group’s online platforms (continued)

Significant  judgments  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  including  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespans 

of virtual items on a regular basis whenever there is any indication of change in the expected users’ relationship 

periods.

The  Group  will  continue  to  monitor  the  average  lifespans  of  the  virtual  items.  The  results  may  differ  from  the 

historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different basis 

from that in prior periods.

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, right-of-use assets as well as investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed 

for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be 

recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-use calculations or fair value less 

costs to sell. These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgment  is  required  to  identify  any  impairment  indicators  existing  for  any  of  the  Group’s  goodwill,  other  non-

financial assets to determine appropriate impairment approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value 

in use, for impairment review purposes, and to select key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, 

including  discounted  cash  flows  and  market  approach.  Changing  the  assumptions  selected  by  management 

in assessing impairment could materially affect the result of the impairment test and in turn affect the Group’s 

financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  If  there  is  a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  key  assumptions 

applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment charge to the consolidated income statement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(c)  Fair value measurement of FVPL, FVOCI and other financial liabilities

The fair value assessment of FVPL, FVOCI and other  financial liabilities that are  measured  at level  3 fair  value 

hierarchy  requires  significant  estimates,  which  include  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility,  relevant  underlying 

financial  projections,  market  information  of  recent  transactions  (such  as  recent  fund  raising  transactions 

undertaken  by  the  investees)  and  other  assumptions.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could 

materially affect the respective fair value of these investments.

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.27(c),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants.  The  directors  have  adopted  the  Binomial  Model  to  determine  the  total  fair  value  of  the  options 

granted, which is to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant judgment on parameters, such 

as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the 

Binomial Model (Note 34).

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Binomial Model was approximately HKD1,073 million (equivalent to approximately RMB976 million) in 2020 (2019: 

HKD3,250 million (equivalent to approximately RMB2,785 million)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2020, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

not lower than 91% (31 December 2019: not lower than 95%).

(e) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the 

worldwide provision for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax in the period 

in which such determination is made.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUES

(a)  Description of segments and principal activities

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s 

internal reporting in order to assess performance, allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based 

on these reports.

The Group has the following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019:

– 

VAS;

– 

Online Advertising;

– 

FinTech and Business Services; and

– 

Others.

The “Others” business segment consists of the financials of investment in, production of and distribution of, films 

and television programmes for third parties, copyrights licensing, merchandise sales and various other activities.

The chief operating decision-makers assess the performance of the operating segments mainly based on segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore, they 

are  not  included  in  the  measure  of  the  segments’  performance  which  is  used  by  the  chief  operating  decision-

makers  as  a  basis  for  the  purpose  of  resource  allocation  and  assessment  of  segment  performance.  Interest 

income, other gains/(losses), net, finance income/(costs), net, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures 

and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019. The revenues 

from external customers reported to the chief operating decision-makers are measured in a manner consistent with 

that applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other  information,  together  with  the  segment  information,  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers,  is 

measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that  applied  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  were  no 

segment assets and segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019.

(iii)  PRC CIT

PRC  CIT  has  been  provided  for  at  applicable  tax  rates  under  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  after 

considering  the  available  preferential  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and  allowances,  and  on  the  estimated 

assessable profit of entities within the Group established in the Mainland of China for the years ended 31 

December 2020 and 2019. The general PRC CIT rate is 25% in 2020 and 2019.

Income tax expense (continued)

(iii)  PRC CIT (continued)

Certain subsidiaries of the Group  in the  Mainland of  China were  approved  as  High  and New  Technology 

Enterprise,  and  accordingly,  they  were  subject  to  a  preferential  corporate  income  tax  rate  of  15%  for 

the  years  ended  31  December  2020  and  2019.  Moreover,  according  to  the  announcement  and  circular 

issued by relevant government authorities, certain subsidiaries which are qualified as national key software 

enterprises were subject to a preferential corporate income tax rate of 10%.

In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to other tax concessions, mainly including the 

preferential policy of “2-year exemption and 3-year half rate concession” and the preferential tax rate of 15% 

applicable to some subsidiaries located in certain areas of the Mainland of China upon fulfillment of certain 

requirements of the respective local governments.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other jurisdictions

Income  tax  on  profit  arising  from  other  jurisdictions,  including  the  United  States,  Europe,  East  Asia  and 

South America, had been calculated on the estimated assessable profit for the year at the respective rates 

prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions, ranging from 12.5% to 35%.

(v)  Withholding tax

According  to  applicable  tax  regulations  prevailing  in  the  PRC,  dividends  distributed  by  a  company 

established in the Mainland of China to a foreign investor with respect to profit derived after 1 January 2008 

are generally subject to a 10% withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong, under the 

double taxation arrangement between the Mainland of China and Hong Kong, the relevant withholding tax 

rate applicable to such foreign investor will be reduced from 10% to 5% subject to the fulfilment of certain 

conditions.

Dividends  distributed  from  certain  jurisdictions  that  the  Group’s  entities  operate  in  are  also  subject  to 

withholding tax at respective applicable tax rates.

preferential tax treatments, as follows:

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption of 

the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted by 

the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS).

In  addition,  the  profit  attributable  to  equity  holders  (numerator)  has  been  adjusted  by  the  effect  of  the  share 

options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, excluding 

those which have anti-dilutive effect to the Group’s diluted EPS.

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 are listed

Some computer equipments contain variable lease payments. Variable payments are used for a variety of reasons, 

including managing cash outflows and minimising the fixed costs. Variable lease payments that depend on usage 

of bandwidth are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments 

occur. Variable lease payments relating to computer equipment leases during the year ended 31 December 2020 

were considered to be insignificant.

The  total  cash  outflow  in  financing  activities  for  leases  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2020  was 

approximately RMB4,068 million (2019: RMB2,882 million), including principal elements of lease payments of

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2020,  amortisation  of  RMB26,758  million  (2019:  RMB27,802  million)  and 

RMB2,315  million  (2019:  RMB1,152  million)  were  charged  to  cost  of  revenues  and  general  and  administrative 

expenses, respectively.

During the year ended 31 December 2020, impairment losses of RMB4,780 million (2019: RMB183 million) on goodwill 

and other intangible assets were charged to the consolidated income statement under “Other gains/(losses), net”, and 

RMB92 million (2019: RMB51 million) were charged to “cost of revenues”.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill was allocated to VAS segment with RMB104,688 million (31 December 2019: RMB86,489 million), FinTech 

and Business Services segment with RMB1,018 million (31 December 2019: RMB34 million) and Others segment with 

RMB2,917 million (31 December 2019: RMB6,933 million).

The Group carries out its impairment testing on goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of 

CGUs to their carrying amounts. For the purpose of goodwill impairment review, the recoverable amount of a CGU (or 

groups of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

The  key  assumptions  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  recoverable  amounts  of  the  CGUs  (or  groups  of  CGUs)  under 

impairment testing were as follows:

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s businesses in online music, online literature, television series and film production 

and  Business  Services,  value  in  use  using  discounted  cash  flows  was  calculated,  in  most  cases,  based  on  five-year 

period to ten-year period financial projections plus a terminal value related to cash flows beyond the projection period 

extrapolated at an estimated terminal growth rate of generally not more than 5% (2019: not more than 5%). Pre-tax 

discount rates ranging from 13% to 23% (2019: 13% to 25%) were adopted, which reflected assessment of time value 

and  specific  risks  relating  to  the  industries  that  the  Group  operates  in.  Management  leveraged  their  experiences  in 

the industries and provided forecast based on past performance and their anticipation of future business and market 

developments. Key parameters applied in the financial projections for impairment review purpose also included revenue 

growth rates, on a compound annual basis, of not more than 22% (2019: not more than 18%).

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)

Impairment tests for goodwill (continued)

During  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2020,  the  goodwill  impairment  was  mainly  related  to  an  acquired  business 

engaged in television series and film production business within Others segment. Management has considered that the 

film and television industry in the Mainland of China is undergoing profound adjustment, as it responds to the fluid and 

changing macro-environment which has been affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic, and accordingly the Group’s 

acquired  TV  and  film  production  business  has  been  suffering  substantially  due  to  production  delays  and  uncertain 

release  dates.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  management  considered  the  acquired  TV  and  film  production 

business as a CGU, and the recoverable amount of the CGU was determined using discounted cash flow calculations 

which derived from a six-year financial projection with annual revenue growth rate ranging from -43.4% to 21.7% and 

pre-tax discount rate of 18.7%. Management leveraged their experiences in the industries and provided forecast based 

on past performance and their anticipation of future business and market developments. As of 31 December 2020, the 

impairment review of the goodwill relating to the acquired TV and film production business was conducted again by the 

management using the same valuation method as of 30 June 2020.

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s online game business and interactive live video business within VAS segment, fair 

value less costs of disposal was determined based on quoted market price of a listed subsidiary or ratios of EV (enterprise 

value) divided by EBITDA of several comparable public companies (range: 20-27x) (2019: range: 10-25x) multiplied by 

the EBITDA of the related CGU (or group of CGUs) and discounted for lack of marketability at a range of 10% to 20% 

(2019:  10%  to  20%).  The  comparable  public  companies  were  chosen  based  on  factors  such  as  industry  similarity, 

company size, profitability and financial risks.

Except as described above, management has not identified reasonably possible change in key assumptions that could 

cause carrying amounts of the CGUs (or groups of CGUs) to exceed the recoverable amount.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group’s additions to investments in associates mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

a  consortium  (the  “UMG  Consortium”)  formed  together  with  Tencent  Music  Entertainment  Group  (“TME”),  a  non 

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain global financial investors to acquire 10% equity interests in Universal 

Music Group (“UMG”) from its parent company, Vivendi S.A.. According to the subscription agreements, the Group has 

significant influence on the UMG Consortium. The Group’s investment in the UMG Consortium amounted to approximately 

EUR1.2 billion. As a result, the investment in the UMG Consortium has been accounted for as an associate by the Group; and

(ii) 

new associates and additional investments in existing associates with an aggregate amount of approximately RMB28,600 

million  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2020  are  principally  engaged  in  online  automobile  finance  transaction 

platform, games, software and other Internet-related business.

(b) 

During the year ended 31 December 2020, transfers mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

HUYA,  an  existing  associate  of  approximately  RMB5,221  million  transferred  to  a  subsidiary  as  a  result  of  business 

combination (Note 41(a));

(ii) 

an  existing  associate  of  approximately  RMB2,349  million  transferred  to  FVOCI  as  a  result  of  retirement  of  board 

representative; and

(iii) 

investments in associates of approximately RMB39,615 million transferred from FVPL as a result of changes in nature 

of these investments and investments in associates of approximately RMB5,075 million transferred from FVOCI due to 

acquiring board representatives.

(c) 

Both external and internal sources of information of associates are considered in assessing whether there is any indication that 

the investment may be impaired, including but not limited to financial position, business performance and market capitalisation. 

The Group carries out impairment assessment on those investments with impairment indications, and the respective recoverable 

amounts of investments are determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

In  respect  of  the  recoverable  amount  using  value  in  use,  the  discounted  cash  flows  calculations  were  based  on  cash  flow 

projections estimated by management and the key assumptions adopted in these cash flow projections include revenue growth 

rate, profit margins and discount rate. The pre-tax discount rates adopted range from 9% to 20%. In respect of the recoverable 

amount based on fair value less costs of disposal, except for those listed associates using their respective market prices, the 

fair value less costs of disposal was calculated using certain key valuation assumptions including the selection of comparable 

companies, recent market transactions and liquidity discount for lack of marketability.

As a result, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of approximately RMB5,254 million (2019: RMB3,877 million) 

against the carrying amounts of certain investments in associates during the year ended 31 December 2020, which includes 

impairment loss of approximately RMB10,611 million recognised and approximately RMB5,357 million reversed. The impairment 

provision/reversal  mainly  resulted  from  revisions  of  financial/business  outlook  of  the  associates  and  changes  in  the  market 

environment of the underlying business.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)

Management  has  assessed  the  level  of  influence  that  the  Group  exercises  on  certain  associates  with  the  respective 

shareholding  below  20%  and  certain  associates  with  shareholding  over  50%  (voting  power  is  below  50%),  with 

total  carrying  amounts  of  RMB212,349  million  and  RMB15,936  million  as  at  31  December  2020,  respectively  (31 

December  2019:  RMB145,971  million  and  RMB13,393  million,  respectively).  Management  determined  that  it  has 

significant influence thereon through the board representation or other arrangements made, and it has no control or 

joint control over such investees as the Group has no power to direct relevant activities due to other arrangements made. 

Consequently, these investments have been classified as associates.

There were no material contingent liabilities relating to the Group’s interests in the associates.

22 

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

As  at  31  December  2020,  the  Group’s  investments  in  joint  ventures  of  RMB7,649  million  (31  December  2019: 

RMB8,280 million) mainly comprised investee companies that are principally a special purpose vehicle of which we have 

a majority stake therein for the investment in one of the telecommunication carriers in the PRC and other joint venture 

initiatives in new retail and entertainment-related business.

Share of loss amounting to RMB76 million was recognised during the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: share of 

loss of RMB310 million) (Note 10).

During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB1,388 million 

(2019: impairment reversal of RMB54 million) against the carrying amounts of the investments in joint ventures, based 

on the respective assessed recoverable amounts.

(i) 

an  additional  investment  in  an  online  video-sharing  services  platform  of  approximately  USD1.5  billion  (equivalent  to 

approximately RMB10.3 billion), which was transferred to investments in associates as a result of changes in nature of the 

investment;

(ii) 

an  additional  investment  in  an  online  education  platform  in  the  Mainland  of  China  of  approximately  USD720  million 

(equivalent to approximately RMB4,982 million);

(iii) 

new  investments  and  additional  investments  with  an  aggregate  amount  of  approximately  RMB47,803  million  in  listed 

and unlisted entities. These companies are principally engaged in eCommerce, Internet platform, technology and other 

Internet-related  businesses.  None  of  the  above  investments  was  individually  significant  that  triggers  any  disclosure

except  as  described  in  Note  21(b),  transfers  also  mainly  comprised  certain  investments  with  an  aggregate  amount  of 

RMB1,723 million designated as FVOCI due to the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares upon their initial 

public offering (“IPO”).

(b)  Management has assessed the level of influence that the Group exercises on certain FVPL with shareholding exceeding 20%. 

Since  these  investments  are  either  held  in  form  of  redeemable  instruments  or  interests  in  limited  life  partnership  without 

significant influence, these investments have been classified as FVPL.

Some online advertising customers and agencies are usually granted with a credit period within 90 days immediately 

following the month-end in which the relevant obligations under the relevant contracted advertising orders are delivered. 

Third party platform providers usually settle the amounts due by them within 60 days. Other customers, mainly including 

content production related customers and FinTech and cloud customers, are usually granted with a credit period within 

90 days.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised 

from initial recognition of the assets. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over 

the expected life of the receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. 

The historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed at year end. 

For the year ended 31 December 2020 and 2019, information about the impairment of accounts receivable and the 

Group’s exposure to credit risk and foreign currency risk can be found in Note 3.1.

As at 31 December 2020, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable approximated their fair values.

33  OTHER RESERVES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with  limited  liabilities  in  the  PRC,  appropriation  of  net  profit  (after  offsetting  accumulated  losses  from  prior  years)  should  be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profit (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer does not need to be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 34(d)).

(d) 

The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity instruments in other comprehensive 

income.  These  changes  are  accumulated  with  FVOCI  reserve  with  equity.  The  Group  transfers  amounts  from  this  reserve  to 

retained earnings when the relevant equity instruments are derecognised.

Annual Report 2020Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 202034  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted five share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II, the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option  Scheme I, the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  II and  the  Post-IPO 

Option Scheme III expired on 31 December 2011, 23 March 2014, 16 May 2017 and 13 May 2019, respectively. 

Upon the expiry of these schemes, no further options would be granted under these schemes, but the options 

granted prior to such expiry continued to be valid and exercisable in accordance with provisions of the schemes. 

As at 31 December 2020, there were no outstanding options exercisable of the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-

IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme III.

In respect of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV which continues to be in force, the Board may, at its discretion, grant 

options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms and conditions 

stipulated  therein.  The  exercise  price  must  be  in  compliance  with  the  requirement  under  the  Listing  Rules.  In 

addition, the option vesting period is determined by the Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year 

period for the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV after the date of grant of option.

During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Company allows certain of the grantees under the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme II to surrender their rights to receive a portion of the underlying shares (with equivalent fair value) to set off 

against the exercise price and individual income tax payable when they exercise their options.

34  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)

(a)  Share option schemes (continued)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Binomial Model to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2020 was HKD115.13 per share (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB104.72  per  share)  (2019:  HKD123.82  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately 

RMB106.09 per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend  yield  and  expected  volatility,  are  required  to  be  made  by  the  directors  in  applying  the  Binomial 

Model, which are summarised as below.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted three share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”) as of 31 December 2020, 

which are administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group. The vesting period of the awarded 

shares is determined by the Board.

Movements in the number of awarded shares for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2020,  59,500  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  five  independent  non-

executive directors of the Company (2019: 59,484 awarded shares were granted to five independent non-executive 

directors of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2020  was 

HKD481.61 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB431.90 per share) (2019: HKD360.25 per share (equivalent 

to approximately RMB313.18 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2020 were divided into one to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from eight 

months to five years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 202034  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)

(c)  Employee investment schemes

For aligning the interests of key employees with the Group, the Group established several employees’ investment 

plans  in  the  form  of  limited  liability  partnerships  (the “EIS”)  among  which  the  five  EISs  established  in  2014, 

2015, 2016, and 2017 are in effect as at 31 December 2020. According to the term of the EISs, the Board may, 

at its absolute discretion, invite any qualifying participants of the Group, excluding any director of the Company, 

to  participate  in  the  EISs  by  subscribing  for  the  partnership  interest  at  cash  consideration.  The  participating 

employees  are  entitled  to  the  economic  benefits  generated  by  the  EISs,  if  any,  after  a  specified  vesting  period 

under the respective EISs, ranging from four to seven years. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company acting as 

general partner of these EISs administer and in essence, control the EISs. These EISs are therefore consolidated by 

the Company as structured entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 were 

insignificant to the Group.

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the respective board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion 

and in accordance with the relevant rules. The share options or restricted shares of the subsidiaries granted are 

normally  vested  by  several  tranches.  Participants  of  some  subsidiaries  have  the  right  to  request  the  Group  to 

repurchase their vested equity interests of the respective subsidiaries (“Repurchase Transaction”). The Group has 

discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Company or by cash. For 

the Repurchase Transaction which the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company are currently of 

the view that some of them would be settled by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are accounted 

for using the equity-settled share-based payment method. For some of them settled in cash, they are accounted 

for using cash-settled share-based payment method.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2020, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be not 

lower than 91% (31 December 2019: not lower than 95%).

All of these notes payable issued by the Group were unsecured.

In May 2020, the Company updated the Global Medium Term Note Programme (the “Programme”) to include, among 

other things, the Company’s recent corporate and financial information.

In  June  2020,  the  Company  issued  four  tranches  of  senior  notes  under  the  Programme  with  an  aggregate  principal 

amount of USD6 billion from 5.5 years to 40 years, with interest rate ranging from 1.810% to 3.290%.

In September 2020, TME issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of USD800 million 

from 5 years to 10 years, with interest rate ranging from 1.375% to 2.000%.

During the year ended 31 December 2020, the notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of USD1,100 million 

issued in February 2015, an aggregate principal amount of HKD2,000 million issued in May 2014 and an aggregate 

principal amount of HKD1,200 million issued in October 2014  reached their  maturity and  were repaid in  full by the 

Group.

As at 31 December 2020, the fair value of the notes payable amounted to RMB132,037 million (31 December 2019: 

RMB98,668 million). The respective fair values are assessed based on the active market price of these notes on the 

reporting date or by making reference to similar instruments traded in the observable market.

(a)  Step-up acquisition of HUYA

On  3  April  2020  (the  “Acquisition  Date  of  HUYA”),  the  Group  exercised  its  call  option  to  acquire  additional 

16,523,819  Class  B  ordinary  shares  in  an  associate,  HUYA  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  approximately 

USD262.6  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB1,860  million)  in  cash  from  JOYY  Inc..  HUYA  is  a  leading 

game  live  streaming  platform  in  China.  After  the  transaction,  the  Group  increased  its  voting  power  in  HUYA 

to  50.9%  and  equity  interests  in  HUYA  to  36.9%  on  an  outstanding  basis,  and  the  Group  considers  it  having 

sufficient power to control HUYA. As a result, HUYA was accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group upon the 

completion of the transaction (“Step-up Acquisition”). The equity interest held under investment in an associate 

was accounted for a deemed disposal at its fair value and resulted in step up gains of approximately RMB2,189 

million.

For  the  non-controlling  interest  in  HUYA,  the  Group  elected  to  recognise  the  non-controlling  interests  that  are 

present ownership interests measured at its proportionate share of the acquired identifiable net assets, and other 

components  of  non-controlling  interests  measured  at  the  acquisition-date  fair  value.  Goodwill  of  approximately 

RMB5,272 million was recognised as a result of the Step-up Acquisition. It was mainly attributable to the operating 

synergies and economies of scale expected to be derived from integration of the operations with the Group. None 

of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose.

41  BUSINESS COMBINATION (continued)

(b)  Privatisation of Bitauto Holdings Limited (“Bitauto”)

On  4  November  2020  (the  “Acquisition  Date  of  Bitauto”),  a  consortium  (the  “Bitauto  Consortium”)  led  by  the 

Group and another investor entered into an agreement to acquire 100% equity interests of Bitauto, an existing 

FVPL of the Group and the shares of which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BITA), at a total 

consideration of USD1,154 million (equivalent to approximately RMB7,589 million) in a going private transaction. 

After  the  closing  of  the  transaction,  the  Group  became  interested  in  68.2%  equity  interests  of  Bitauto  on  an 

outstanding basis, and the Group considers it having sufficient power to control Bitauto. As a result, Bitauto was 

accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group upon the closing of the transaction and ceased to be a publicly traded 

company.

Goodwill of approximately RMB814 million was recognised as a result of the transaction. It was mainly attributable 

to the operating synergies and economies of scale expected to be derived from combining the operations. None of 

the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose. The Group chose to record the non-controlling 

equity interests in Bitauto Consortium at fair value on Acquisition Date of Bitauto.

(b)  Privatisation of Bitauto Holdings Limited (“Bitauto”) (continued)

Note:

The Group’s revenue for the year would be increased by not more than 5% and results for the year would not be materially 

different should the transaction have occurred on 1 January 2020.

The related transaction costs of the transaction are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(c)  Privatisation of Leyou Technologies Holdings Limited (“Leyou”)

On 21 December 2020 (Cayman Islands  time), the Group entered into an  exclusivity  agreement  with Leyou, a 

company listed on the Stock Exchange (Ticker: HK.1089) to acquire 100% equity interests of Leyou, at a total 

consideration of HKD10,695 million (equivalent to approximately RMB9,076 million) in a going private transaction. 

As a result, Leyou was accounted for as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group upon completion of the transaction 

and ceased to be a publicly traded company.

Goodwill  of  approximately  RMB6,045  million  was  recognised  as  a  result  of  the  transaction.  It  was  mainly 

attributable  to  the  operating  synergies  and  economies  of  scale  expected  to  be  derived  from  combining  the 

operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose. The Group chose to record 

the non-controlling equity interests in Leyou at fair value on the acquisition date of Leyou.

The Group’s revenue for the year would be increased by not more than 5% and results for the year would not be 

materially different should the transaction have occurred on 1 January 2020.

The related transaction costs of the transaction are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(d)  Other business combinations

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2020,  the  Group  also  acquired  certain  insignificant  subsidiaries.  The 

aggregate  considerations  for  these  acquisitions  were  approximately  RMB6,718  million,  fair  value  of  net  assets 

acquired  (including  identifiable  intangible  assets),  non-controlling  interests  and  goodwill  recognised  were 

approximately RMB2,141 million, RMB1,326 million and RMB5,903 million, respectively.

The revenue and the results contributed by these acquired subsidiaries for the period since respective acquisition 

date were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different 

if these acquisitions have occurred on 1 January 2020.

The related transaction costs of these business combinations are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial 

statements.

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non wholly-owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non wholly-owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(c) 

All subsidiaries’ undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary’s undertakings 

held directly by the parent company does not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company further does 

not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As  at  31  December  2020,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  term  deposits  and  restricted  cash  of  the  Group,  amounting  to 

RMB146,762 million were held in the Mainland of China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and 

treasury regulations. The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment 

of dividends, share repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 34(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 34(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes which 

  are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2020,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB1,865  million  (2019:  RMB1,186 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
