BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

1. 

Company Strategic Highlights

2018  marked  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  founding  of  the  Group.  Throughout  our  history,  we  have  constantly  been 

embracing  changes  in  users’  needs,  technologies  and  market  conditions  to  stay  at  the  forefront  of  our  industry.  In 

October, we initiated a strategic organisational upgrade to extend our strengths in the Consumer Internet and to capture 

the opportunities of the Industrial Internet. This strategic upgrade is intended to enable us to drive the convergence of 

social, content and technology trends, and to better serve enterprises, as well as consumers.

During the year, we stepped up our investment in innovation and technologies to stay competitive in the evolving Internet 

industry. We enriched our social platforms with a broader portfolio of digital content, as well as online and offline services, 

thus deepening our connection with our users, advertisers, merchants and enterprise partners. Through these initiatives, 

we strengthened our market leadership in social, games, digital content, and payment, contributing to continuing growth 

across our core business segments.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Chairman’s StatementWe made the following key achievements in our core businesses:

Our social communications platforms, Weixin and QQ, represent the largest social communities in China in terms of 

MAU. The combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat increased to approximately 1,098 million by the end of 2018. Weixin 

further penetrated lower tier cities and covered a wider age group of users. On average, over 750 million Weixin users 

read friends’ posts on Moments per day.

Mini Programs are now widely adopted by users and enterprises setting the industry trends for connecting online users to 

offline scenarios. DAU grew rapidly and daily visits per user increased by 54% year-on-year. Mini Programs cover more 

than 200 service sectors and connect with our users via multiple channels, including shortcuts in the chat interface, our 

in-app search function and offline Mini Programs QR Codes. In addition to connecting with online users, Mini Programs 

enable developers to achieve cross-platform development and instantaneous deployment for their products and services. 

We empower developers with cloud-based development kits, enhancing the development efficiency, particularly for long-

tail developers. Daily visits to long-tail Mini Programs increased significantly, accounting for 43% of the total daily visits to 

Mini Programs.

Overall MAU of QQ increased to 807 million by the end of 2018. We stayed engaged with young users as QQ introduced 

innovative and AI-empowered features to make its chat experience more fun and interactive. We offer entertainment-

oriented content in verticals including eSports, comics and live streaming services to cater to the entertainment needs of 

millennial users. In particular, we further increased the user engagement of QQ KanDian, a popular news feed service 

among young users, through enriching its content with video feeds.

We have built up a content ecosystem covering online games, literature, video, music, news and comics. For online 

games,  we  are  the  leading  platform  globally  by  revenue  and  users.  Our  technical  strength  supports  the  operation  of 

multiple PC and mobile blockbuster game titles, serving hundreds of millions of active users every day. Internationally, 

our subsidiary Riot Games operates the highest-MAU PC game, League of Legends, and we operate the highest-MAU 

smart  phone  game,  PUBG  MOBILE.  Through  our  partnerships  with  and  investments  in  global  leaders  such  as  Epic 

Games (creator of Fortnite) and Supercell (creator of Clash of Clans), we support the innovation and growth of the global 

game industry. In China, our popular smart phone games expanded our user base and increased time spent. We have 

taken  the  lead  in  introducing  the  Healthy  Gameplay  System  to  assist  parents  in  managing  the  amount  of  time  their 

children spend playing games. We upgraded the system last September by introducing measures to strengthen real-

name verification, and implementing game time limits for children players, as well as spending alerts to their parents. 

Our Tencent Game Guardian Platform enables parents to engage with their children and track their in-game activities 

online. We recently provided teachers access to this platform to enhance their engagement with their students who play 

games. These initiatives built a pilot case for the China game industry and, we believe, help position it for sustainable 

and healthy growth in the long run.

5

Annual Report 2018Chairman’s StatementLeveraging our rich IP portfolio, we provide digital content to our users across online media platforms. Our total digital 

content subscription counts exceeded 100 million by the end of 2018, up 50% year-on-year. High quality content, better 

IP protection, enhanced streaming capabilities and convenience of mobile payment were the growth drivers for our digital 

content subscription business. Tencent Video is the leading online video streaming platform in China in terms of mobile 

DAU and subscriptions, generating the highest revenues in the online video market in China through subscriptions and 

advertising. TME is the leading online music entertainment platform in China, operating the country’s most popular and 

innovative music apps — QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and WeSing. In December 2018, we listed TME on the 

New York Stock Exchange. News feeds, short videos and mini videos contributed substantially to traffic on our media 

and distribution platforms including Tencent News, QQ KanDian, Mobile QQ Browser and Weishi.

During  2018,  we  enhanced  the  monetisation  potential  of  our  platforms  through  connecting  more  advertisers,  across 

more  platforms,  with  more  accurate  user  targeting  capabilities.  For  social  advertising,  we  increased  our  advertising 

inventory through adding the second ad unit in Weixin Moments, and we started to insert ad units into Mini Programs. 

For media advertising, we completed the system revamp of our news advertising in early 2018. Leveraging our enhanced 

recommendation  algorithms,  steady  traffic  growth  and  rising  fill  rates,  our  news  feed  business  significantly  grew  its 

advertising revenues. Our video advertising outpaced the industry in terms of its revenue amount and revenue growth 

rate, due to the popularity of our content, especially self-commissioned content, and the strong growth in sponsorship 

advertising revenue. As part of the Company’s strategic reorganisation, we merged our advertising sales teams to provide 

better marketing solutions, data analytics, and ad placement processes for our advertisers, thus enhancing their ROIs.

Payment is one of the key infrastructure platforms of the Company, enabling us and our merchant partners to complete 

transactions for online and offline services. We extended our market leadership as the leading mobile payment platform 

by active users and number of transactions in China. Our total daily payment transaction volume exceeded 1 billion for 

2018, driven by rapid growth in commercial payments, which represented more than half of the number of transactions. 

Our commercial payment revenue more than doubled year-on-year in 2018. Our payment platform connects with tens 

of millions of merchants and monthly active merchants increased over 80% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

We boosted our payment penetration in the food and retail industries thanks to features such as our Mini Programs and 

Scan-to-Pay solution. In Hong Kong, we launched the first-of-its-kind cross-border mobile payment service in October 

2018, which enables WeChat Pay Hong Kong users to conduct RMB-denominated transactions funded by Hong Kong 

dollars. This cross-border mobile payment service now covers approximately 1 million merchants in Mainland China, 

including taxi-hailing, food ordering, and high-speed railway ticketing services. The transaction volume of WeChat Pay 

Hong Kong increased more than 10 times year-on-year. We launched WeChat Pay Malaysia services in August, offering 

online  transactions  such  as  mobile  credit  top-ups,  flight  and  bus  ticket  purchases,  and  offline  transactions  at  retail 

outlets, such as supermarkets, fashion and beauty stores. Globally, we are expanding our footprint by supporting China 

outbound  travelers  to  make  cross-border  payments  in  overseas  destinations,  and  we  now  offer  real-time  tax  refund 

services for Weixin Pay users in over 80 airports. Weixin Pay is now available in 49 markets outside Mainland China, 

supporting cross-border payment transactions in 16 currencies.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Chairman’s StatementBuilding on our payment user base, we offer FinTech services to under-served consumers, conveniently and at low cost. 

LiCaiTong, our wealth management platform, helped manage over RMB600 billion of customer assets as of the end of 

2018. WeBank, our associate with an online banking business, achieved rapid growth in the outstanding loan balance 

of its micro-loan product for consumers, WeiLiDai. WeBank also expanded its loan services to enterprises, serving the 

financing needs for small and micro businesses customers through WeiYeDai.

Tencent Cloud is the foundation for our smart industry solutions. We integrate our cloud computing technology with AI 

and data analytics capabilities, to assist the digital transformation of various industries. Our online security capabilities 

enhance the stability and reliability of our cloud solutions. During 2018, Tencent Cloud maintained market leadership 

in verticals such as online games and streaming video leveraging our industry know-how and solid infrastructure. We 

now serve over half of the China-based games companies and are expanding  overseas.  We expanded our customer 

base rapidly for Internet services via strategic partnership in verticals. Key categories include eCommerce, social media 

and community, handset manufacturer app stores and smart transportation. We have further expanded our presence in 

other key industries such as financial and retail sectors. We are the partner of choice for top banks including BOC, CCB 

and CMB. Majority of top online finance companies and insurance firms are our clients. Our retail cloud solutions build 

on our unique properties such as Official Accounts and Mini Programs to increase retailers’ consumer engagement, 

enhance their marketing ROI via our consumer targeting and anti-fraud technologies, and upgrade internal operations 

using AI, LBS and big data technologies.

In addition to growing our core businesses organically, we make strategic investments in best-in-class companies so 

we can focus our management attention and company resources on our own core platforms, while capturing emerging 

opportunities in adjacent verticals through investee companies. We have invested in more than 700 companies. More 

than 100 investee companies were valued at over USD1 billion each. Among which, over 60 went public. We enrich 

our IP portfolio including games, video, music and literature via upstream investments, and broaden user reach and 

engagement  via  investments  in  vertical  platforms.  We  work  with  businesses  that  can  expand  our  offerings  to  meet 

evolving user needs, and accelerate the adoption of our enterprise services and products, such as O2O and smart retail 

companies, which has helped our payment service penetration and advertiser base expansion. And, we use investments 

as a tool for better understanding frontier technologies which will become important to our future, such as connected 

cars,  Internet-facilitated  healthcare,  and  quantum  computing.  Our  investments  have  created  value  for  our  investee 

companies by offering them access to our large user base, and providing them infrastructure, technology and capital 

support to bolster their growth.

Communication and Social

– 

Weixin and WeChat: Combined MAU was 1,098 million, up by 11.0% year-on-year. Hundreds of millions of social 

videos are uploaded and shared on the Weixin platform every day. We enriched our user experience via a new 

video function that allows users to share 15-second mini video clips with AI-recommended background music with 

friends. WeChat Work, an enterprise application integrated with Weixin, allows companies to deepen engagement 

with  customers,  digitalise  user  profiles  for  data  analytics,  facilitate  office  administration  and  enhance  internal 

communication.  It  is  seeing  particularly  rapid  adoption  by  large  enterprises,  providing  a  showcase  for  SMEs. 

Approximately 80% of the top 500 enterprises in China are now registered as WeChat Work corporate users.

– 

QQ: Smart device MAU was 699.8 million, up by 2.5% year-on-year. Smart device MAU for users aged 21 years 

or  below  increased  by  13%  year-on-year.  We  further  increased  young  user  stickiness  by  enhancing  the  video 

recording functions and news feed features. We launched AI-powered filters and stickers for video chat, increasing 

the number of short and mini videos shared by young users by over 50% year-on-year. For QQ KanDian, we added 

a bullet chatting function within video and enhanced video feed recommendation algorithms, boosting the click-

through volume and increasing user time spent. QQ KanDian daily video views rose over 300% year-on-year.

Online Games

For 2018, our smart phone games business achieved RMB77.8 billion revenues (including smart phone games revenues 

attributable to our social networks business), up 24% year-on-year; for the fourth quarter, it achieved RMB19.0 billion 

revenues, up 12% year-on-year. We released 9 licensed games in the fourth quarter, most of which were role playing 

games. The industry regulator re-started issuing game monetisation license (“banhao”) approvals in December 2018, 

after  a  nine-month  suspension.  A  total  of  8  Tencent  games  (including  7  smart  phone  games  and  1  PC  game)  have 

received approval so far, including role playing games, strategy, casual and functional genres. Since there is a sizeable 

backlog for the banhao applications in the industry, our scheduled game releases will initially be slower than in some 

prior years. We have implemented our upgraded Healthy Gameplay System in 39 smart phone games, including our 

most popular titles such as Honour of Kings, QQ Speed Mobile, Cross Fire Mobile, Naruto OL Mobile and MT4. The 

system has resulted in minors spending significantly less time in the affected games, but immaterial impact on time 

spent by adult players.

9

Annual Report 2018Chairman’s Statement 
 
In China, we increased our market share in smart phone games in terms of active users. We enhanced user engagement 

across  multiple  genres.  For  action  titles,  QQ  Speed  Mobile’s  anniversary  promotions  increased  its  DAU  sequentially. 

Cross Fire Mobile introduced a season pass to encourage in-game engagement. For role playing games, we launched 

several IP-based games that attracted fans of popular anime and comic franchises such as Battle through the Heavens, 

Naruto OL Mobile and Samurai Spirits. For MOBA, Honour of Kings organised its flagship eSports event KPL Fall Final 

in December, attracting over 75 million unique viewers for the live broadcast. In international markets, PUBG MOBILE 

achieved  breakout  success,  becoming  the  most  popular  game  globally  by  MAU,  and  was  named  the  Best  Game  of 

2018  by  Google  Play.  Our  investee  companies’  success  added  to  our  proven  track  record  of  working  with  category 

leaders in the games industry. For example, Supercell’s new MOBA game Brawl Stars was the most downloaded game 

in 50 markets after its global launch in December 2018. And, Epic Games’ Fortnite continued its phenomenal success, 

topping US iOS Grossing Chart in the fourth quarter. Sea’s first self-developed game, Free Fire, was the fourth most 

downloaded game globally in 2018, according to App Annie.

Our  PC  client  games  business  achieved  approximately  RMB50.6  billion  revenues,  down  8%  year-on-year,  for  2018, 

and approximately RMB11.2 billion revenues for the fourth quarter, down 13% year-on-year as users continue to shift 

time to mobile. League of Legends introduced its first season pass and increased average user time spent, with active 

users growing sequentially after a China team won the World Championship in November 2018. We released a sequel to 

NBA2K in China, significantly expanding the total user base of this popular basketball franchise. We launched two new 

internally developed PC games, Iris Fall and Bladed Fury, to better serve niche audience interests.

Digital Content

Our fee-based VAS subscriptions were up by 19.1% year-on-year to 160.3 million, mainly attributable to growth in video 

and music subscriptions. Tencent Video expanded its subscription counts to 89 million, up 58% year-on-year, driven by 

premium content and cross-promotions. We released sequels to popular self-commissioned IPs, extending the longevity 

and  monetisation  opportunities  of  these  IPs.  These  included  Candle  in  the  Tomb  Season  3  in  the  drama  category, 

the Land of Warriors Season 2 in Chinese anime, and Once Upon A Bite in documentary (whose related IP program, 

Flavorful Origins, we licensed to Netflix for distribution outside China). We upgraded our VIP loyalty program to offer 

subscribers different tiers of privileges. We maintained healthy engagement trends with video views per DAU up over 

40% year-on-year, as consumers watched more short form videos. We are the leading streaming platform for sports fans 

in China, featuring 40 top global sports IPs, including the 4 major sports leagues in the US. We distribute sports content 

in live programs, news feeds and short videos formats across Tencent Sports, Tencent News, Tencent Video, Mobile QQ 

Browser and WeiShi. Since we began licensing NBA live streaming rights in 2015, we have expanded the total audience 

size for NBA games in China. Over the period, average daily unique visitors per live-streamed NBA game in China have 

tripled.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Chairman’s Statement 
Online Advertising

Our  online  advertising  business  achieved  RMB58.1  billion  revenues,  up  44%  year-on-year,  for  2018,  and  RMB17.0 

billion revenues, up 38% year-on-year, for the fourth quarter. Social and others advertising grew to RMB39.8 billion, 

up  55%  year-on-year  for  the  full  year,  and  RMB11.8  billion,  up  44%  year-on-year  for  the  fourth  quarter,  driven  by 

Weixin Moments, Mini Programs, QQ KanDian and our mobile advertising network. We received positive feedback from 

advertisers after the launch of the second daily ad unit for Moments, and the overall ad fill rates remained high. About 

50% of Moments DAU were shown the second ad unit, and Moments ad click-through rates remained at healthy levels. 

Media advertising revenues amounted to RMB18.3 billion, up 23% for the full year, and RMB5.2 billion, up 26% for the 

fourth quarter. Among which, video advertising revenues increased by 34% year-on-year for 2018 and 21% year-on-year 

for the fourth quarter. The increase in the fourth quarter was driven by more video views and sponsorship advertising for 

our popular self-commissioned variety shows. Our news advertising revenues picked up year-on-year in the latter half of 

the year, recovering from our system revamp. Media feed advertising revenues grew by over 10 times year-on-year.

Others

Our  other  businesses  grew  revenues  by  80%  year-on-year  for  the  year  2018,  primarily  contributed  by  FinTech  and 

cloud services. The increase in FinTech revenues was driven by our take-rate on commercial transactions collected from 

merchants, cash withdrawal fees and credit card repayment charges collected from users, and the service fees from 

financial institutions for the distribution of FinTech products such as WeiLiDai and the wealth management products on 

our LiCaiTong platform. In January 2019, we completed the transition to the centralised clearing and settlement system 

and moved all custodian cash to the accounts of the People’s Bank of China.

As we added more use cases online and offline for our payment services, our payment active users increased robustly 

year-on-year. Users’ transaction frequency and value per transaction also increased. Weixin Pay launched a new user 

interface enabling easier access to new features including virtual subsidiary cards for parents and children. We enhanced 

account  management  tools  for  merchants,  including  cash  register,  book-keeping  and  revenue  sharing  settlement 

functions. LiCaiTong enlarged its user base, reaching 100 million accumulated users by end of 2018. We expanded our 

FinTech services by rolling out LingQianTong, which enables users to invest the unused cash balance in their Weixin Pay 

accounts in funds.

Our cloud revenues increased by over 100% to RMB9.1 billion for the year 2018. Paying customers more than doubled 

year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. Tencent Cloud’s global infrastructure covered 25 regions and operated 53

environment.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 5% to RMB5,730 million for the fourth quarter 

of 2018 on a year-on-year basis. The decrease was primarily driven by the reduction of advertising and promotion expenses

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-GAAP financial 

measures (in terms of, operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, net margin, profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS), have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-GAAP financial 

measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared 

in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used 

by other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impacts 

of M&A transactions. In addition, non-GAAP adjustments include relevant non-GAAP adjustments for the Group’s material 

associates based on available published financials of the relevant material associates, or estimates made by the Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group had net debt of RMB12,170 million, compared to net debt of RMB29,227 million as of 

30 September 2018. The sequential decrease in indebtedness was mainly due to free cash flow generation, proceeds from 

TME’s capital raising activities and disposals of our stakes in certain investee companies, partially offset by payments for M&A 

initiatives and media content.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  the  Group  had  free  cash  flow  of  RMB28,623  million.  This  was  a  result  of  net  cash  flow 

generated from operating activities of RMB33,221 million, offset by payments for capital expenditure of RMB4,598 million.

Annual Report 2018Directors’ ReportCONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with  the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by themselves or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History 

and Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group 

is able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts 

are also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to 

acquire the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and  “Structure  Contracts”  in  the  IPO  prospectus  of  the  Company.  During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  there  was 

no material change in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the 

Structure Contracts has been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been 

removed.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Directors’ ReportRequirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2018

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening  the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games  and  the Examination and Approval of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定”規定》和中央編辦有關解釋,進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進口

網絡遊戲審批管理的通知)  (the  “Circular  13”)  jointly  issued  by  PRC  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication,  the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly-

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

However, Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between foreign 

online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether the State 

General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television will deem the Group’s structure and operations to be 

in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through the OPCOs that hold 

the necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Directors’ ReportThe risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due  to  the  legal  constraints  in  relation  to  foreign  investment  in  the  telecommunications  value-added  services  industry  in 

the PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the 

WFOEs derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these 

intragroup contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and 

adverse impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the 

tax treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors - Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus of the Company.

Other connected transactions

Save as the related parties transaction disclosed in Note 13(a) (Senior management’s emoluments), Note 13(b) (Five highest 

paid individuals),  Note 14 (Benefits and interests of directors), Note 20 (Transactions with  associates),  Note 25 (Loans  to 

investees  and  investees’  shareholders)  and  Note  33  (Share-based  payments)  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  no 

related party transaction disclosed in the consolidated financial statements constitutes a discloseable connected transaction 

as defined under the Listing Rules. The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements set out in Chapter 14A of the 

Listing Rules.

Annual Report 2018Directors’ ReportMaintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  are  based  on  the  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code.  The  Board 

believes that throughout the year ended 31 December 2018, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the roles of the chairman 

and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes 

when appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s 

execution of such strategy.

The Board has defined the business and governance issues for which it needs to be responsible for, and these matters are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this 

regard, the Board:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual business plan and budget;

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned;

approves the Company’s financial statements and interim and annual reports;

determines the Group’s communication policy;

76

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance Report‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

determines director selection, orientation and evaluation;

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control,  internal  audit  and  regulatory  compliance 

procedures in place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders;

establishes Board committees with clear terms of reference and responsibilities as appropriate;

defines levels of delegation in respect of specific matters, with required authority to Board committees and management;

‧  monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the businesses of the Group;

‧ 

‧ 

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders; and

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness.

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long-term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specify its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

The Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor;

reviews the Company’s financial information;

exercises oversight of the Company’s financial reporting system;

reviews the work done by the Company’s management with respect to risk management and internal control systems; 

and

oversees the risks undertaken by the Company including determining the level of risk the Company expects to and is 

able to take.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance ReportThe major work of the committees during the year 2018 is set out on pages 84 to 87.

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring that Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe education and training are important for maintaining  an effective Board.  New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2018, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The chart below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2018:

A high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot be maintained only with the Board’s efforts. Each of the Group’s 

employees plays a role in contributing to such cause. A code of conduct which emphasises integrity and respect is distributed 

by the Company to all employees and it forms part of the employment agreement with each of the employees.

79

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportIn  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

training has been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

the company secretary attends training in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements; and

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in order to promote the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the roles of the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time to 

make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board and 

committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly briefed at the 

Board meetings, and he works with the senior management team to provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete and reliable 

information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for 

discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Chairman held a meeting with 

the non-executive directors (including the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive directors 

as required by the Listing Rules.

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary 

changes when appropriate.

80

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance ReportComposition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of eight directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors and four independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2018 and up to the date of this 

annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 53 to 56 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings and to bring professional judgment and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, policies, performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the  shareholders’  interests  being  the  utmost  important  factor.  The  non-executive  directors  also  exercise  their  professional 

judgment and utilise their expertise to scrutinise the Company’s performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor 

performance reporting.

Further,  in  compliance  with  Rule  3.10  of  the  Listing  Rules,  two  of  our  independent  non-executive  directors  have  the 

appropriate professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice 

from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation 

annually  of  his  independence  and  the  Nomination  Committee  has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all 

independent non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 

of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

81

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportAppointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2018 annual general meeting, Messrs Li Dong Sheng and Iain Ferguson Bruce retired and were re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, there is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and 

development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to the sustainable development of the Group. Given 

the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial and 

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  company  secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the 

Board meeting to each of the directors at least 14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary 

also sends the agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in 

advance of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial 

performance and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as 

promptly and fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, 

such director will declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 

senior management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 

expense in appropriate circumstances.

83

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  ensuring  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. Draft and final version of the minutes of meetings are sent to the 

directors  for  comments  and  records  respectively  within  a  reasonable  time  after  each  meeting,  and  final  minutes  with  the 

relevant board papers and related materials are kept by the company secretary and are available for review and inspection by 

the directors at any time.

THE COMMITTEES

As described above, the Board has established five committees, each of which has been delegated responsibilities and reports 

back to the Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and 

Remuneration Committee. The roles and functions of these committees are set out in their respective terms of reference. The

In conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured that no individual or any of his associates was involved in determining his own remuneration. It also ensured that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned 

with the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate 

high performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

time, including the Group’s business and financial position in sufficient detail, to give the directors a balanced, understandable 

and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides 

all  necessary  and  relevant  information  to  the  Board,  giving  the  directors  sufficient  explanation  and  information  they  need 

to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information put before them for 

approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the “Independent Auditor’s 

Report”.

87

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportAdequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s business strategies. The risk management and internal control systems shall also ensure the achievement of the 

Company’s objectives in operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable 

laws, regulations and policies.

The  Board  acknowledges  that  it  is  the  Board’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  Company  has  established  and  maintained 

adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  Board  delegates  its  responsibility  to  the  Audit 

Committee to review the practices of management with respect to risk management and internal control, including the design, 

implementation and supervision of the risk management and internal control systems. This review formally takes place on a 

quarterly basis. The Audit Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems on an 

annual basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the risk level the 

Company expects and is able to take, and proactively considering, analysing and formulating strategies to manage the key risks 

that the Company is exposed to.

To  ensure  that  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  effective,  the  Company,  under  the  supervision  and 

guidance of the Board and factoring the actual needs of the Company, has adopted the “Three Lines of Defence” internal 

monitoring model as an official organisational structure for risk management and internal control.

The First Line of Defence -- Operation and Management

The  First  Line  of  Defence  is  mainly  formed  by  the  business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  of  the 

Company who are responsible for the day-to-day operation and management. It is responsible for designing and implementing 

controls to address the risks.

The Second Line of Defence -- Risk Management

The Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. This line of defence is responsible for formulating policies related to the risk 

management and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk 

control systems. For ensuring effective implementation of such systems, this line of defence also assists and supervises the 

first line of defence in the establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

88

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance ReportThe Third Line of Defence -- Independent Assurance

The Third Line of Defence mainly consists of the IA and the anti-fraud investigation department.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing an independent evaluation on the effectiveness 

of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems, and monitoring management’s continuous improvement over 

the risk management and internal control areas.

The anti-fraud investigation department is responsible for receiving whistleblower reports through various channels and for 

following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the  “Tencent Sunshine 

Code of Conduct” (the “Sunshine Code”) and the value of integrity to all employees of the Company.

The IA and the anti-fraud investigation department have direct reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 

provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board and management have always placed importance on the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 

In 2018, the Company has invested even more resources in the continuous improvement of the risk management and internal 

control systems, which have also increased the awareness of risk management among the employees. The internal control 

function  has  continuously  worked  closely  with  and  provided  proactive  supports  to  the  business  groups  in  their  business 

development and risk management. Furthermore, the IA has also continued to promote the deployment of continuous audits 

to provide more effective and timely independent evaluations. The anti-fraud investigation department further strengthened the 

values of integrity among the employees, followed up and investigated the alleged fraudulent activities timely. The connection 

and  interaction  among  the  three  lines  of  defence  have  been  further  strengthened  to  have  more  positive  supports  to  the 

Company.

Risk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving the risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

through  the  enhancement  of  risk  management  ability,  to  ensure  long-term  growth  and  sustainable  development  of  the 

Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” internal monitoring model 

as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party as well as the relevant risk management 

policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses risk factors that may 

negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The Company’s staff also 

attends training in relation to risk management and internal control on a regular basis.

89

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportRisk Management Process

Being  an  Internet  company  with  a  wide  variety  of  rapidly-changing  businesses,  the  Company  has  adopted  the  following 

dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

‧  Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

‧ 

The IC collects, analyses and consolidates a list of significant risks at the company level, and provides input on risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses  and  control  measures  will  be  reviewed  by  senior  management  and  subsequently  by  the  Audit  Committee 

before reporting to the Board;

‧ 

‧ 

The IC reviews and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with supports from the IC.

Significant Risks of the Company

In  2018,  management  has  identified  and  determined  nine  significant  risks  of  the  Company  through  the  risk  management 

process detailed above. Comparing with 2017, “Fraud risk” is the one additional risk identified and disclosed as one of the 

significant risks of the Company in 2018. As the Company’s business scale, scope and complexity have evolved, so does its 

external environment, management considers that the Company is still facing the eight significant risks disclosed in 2017 - 

both the “Regulatory and compliance risk” and “Social responsibility risk” have been elevated in different degrees while the 

other risks stay at the similar level as last year.

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  the  Audit  Committee  assists  the  Board  in  supervising  the  overall  risk  status  of  the  Company 

and  evaluating  the  change  in  the  nature  and  severity  of  the  Company’s  major  risks.  The  Audit  Committee  considers  that 

management has taken appropriate measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a 

level acceptable to the Board.

90

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance ReportBelow is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk 

profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

1.  Regulatory and compliance risk

Although the Internet and technology industry is still evolving, regulatory authorities in numerous jurisdictions have been, 

in an attempt to keep up with such evolution, developing more comprehensive and stringent regulations to regulate the 

industry. As the Company is continuously expanding its businesses in the PRC and overseas, it is required to comply 

with the  new applicable laws and regulations in different jurisdictions that are specifically relevant to the Company’s 

businesses, such as laws relating to data protection, Internet information security, IP, gaming and Internet finance. In 

addition, the uncertainty of policy direction may have an impact on the development of different industries in different 

regions.

The Company has set up several professional departments and teams that work closely with management of business 

groups  to  monitor  and  identify  changes  in  any  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  so  as  to  take  appropriate  actions  or 

measures to ensure the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We have invested abundant 

resources in many aspects to ensure the compliance of regulatory requirements. In addition, the Company also actively 

exchanges view and information with relevant regulatory authorities on the trend and development of Internet industry.

2.  Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet industry is highly competitive, innovative and ever-changing. The cross-sectoral expansion of non-Internet 

companies  adds  more  new  participants  to  the  market.  The  users’  desire  for  innovative  products  and  service  is  also 

increasing. Therefore, to attract new users while maintaining its existing market share is still one of the challenges of the 

Company. The lack of innovation or slow innovation in technology and product would impair the core competitiveness of 

the Company.

The  Company  stays  on  top  of  the  industry  trends,  keeps  up  with  the  technological  trend  through  innovation.  The 

Company focuses on changes in user experience, and continuously recruits more talents; optimises its organisational 

structure; enhances the innovation capabilities by improving talent quality and cultivating young talents; enhances its 

technical capabilities and innovation environment to develop products that meet the expectations of the market. The 

Company leverages the strength of the existing platforms to seek better business partners for exploring new business 

opportunities and better responding to the market needs. The Company has established a number of open platforms 

with  the  aim  to  promote  “mutual  benefit  and  win-win”  concept,  and  to  strengthen  the  cooperation  with  its  business 

partners. For example, “Double Hundred Plan” of Tencent Westart Space, which incubates potential startup companies, 

has enhanced its collaboration with business partners and its competitiveness in the market.

91

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance Report3.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high-quality user experience. Any material 

functional  defect,  interruption,  breakdown  or  other  issue  in  connection  is  likely  to  materially  adversely  impact  the 

Company’s businesses.

The  Company  has  been  continuously  investing  in  the  infrastructure  for  products  and  platforms  of  the  Company  to 

enhance its disaster recovery capability in order to provide stable support to the business development. Various business 

departments are also engaged in emergency procedures to ensure the smooth operation of the Company’s businesses. 

In addition, the Company has established dedicated teams to develop business contingency plans and perform periodic 

drills on the plans to ensure their effectiveness.

4. 

Information security risk

Protecting  user  data  is  the  top  priority  of  the  Company,  and  the  Company  is  fully  aware  that  any  loss  or  leakage  of 

sensitive user information could have a significant negative impact on the affected users and the Company’s reputation, 

even lead to potential legal action against the Company.

The Company is obliged to protect sensitive user information and as such, the Company strives to provide the highest 

level of protection on such data. In this regard, the Company has formulated policies and control measures to protect 

user data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, encryption, access restrictions and 

process protocols. In addition, the Company performs review periodically and engages independent specialists to review 

the Company’s data protection practices and provides training programmes to employees to enhance their awareness of 

information security.

5.  2B business risk

The Company has actively developed various 2B businesses related to Industrial Internet. With the rapid development 

of  the  2B  business  of  the  Company,  if  the  Company  fails  to  optimise  its  organisational  structure  with  support  from 

professional  talents  to  quickly  explore  new  business  operating  and  management  models,  or  improve  its  cooperation 

mechanisms with various business partners, it may affect the continuous healthy development of the 2B business.

The Company is accumulating and solidifying its experience in the 2B business. The Company has been proactively 

responding  to  the  challenges  by  having  optimised  its  organisational  structure  and  resource  allocation,  continuously 

improving  the  business  process,  and  recruiting  more  2B  business  professional  talents  and  setting  up  appropriate 

mechanisms to ensure the effective operation of the 2B business for rapid and sustained development.

92

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance Report6.  Social responsibility risk

With the diverse products and platforms of the Company and its expanding user base, the products and platforms of the 

Company have gained considerable influence in wider society. The Company’s products and platforms are subject to 

increased scrutiny from a social responsibility perspective.

The Company has long been endeavoring to promote the healthy development of the Internet industry, and efforts are 

being made to make the products and platforms of the Company exert a positive community influence. The Company 

pays close attention to content quality, product design and operation of the platform. The Company actively provides 

more  assurance  to  the  society  by  using  advanced  technology  to  prohibit  any  illegal  and  unhealthy  information  and 

content access the Company’s platform and products. The Company encourages the study of key technologies and basic 

science, and actively propagates and enriches Chinese traditional culture. For example, the “Tencent Game Guardian 

Platform” is a time management tool used to control the time juveniles spend on games; “Shepherd Plan” is a non-profit 

platform used for preventing fraud; the “Xplore Prize” has been initiated by the Company in cooperation with many well-

known scientists; and the Company has been cooperating with Forbidden City Museum to propagate excellent traditional 

culture  by  creative  technologies.  At  the  same  time,  the  Company  has  established  a  sound  monitoring  and  reporting 

mechanism to deal with illegal and vicious contents.

7.  Crisis management and reputation risk

As one of the China’s largest technology companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses, products and investments, the 

Company always attracts very high attention from the public and media. The media is diverse and information spreads 

rapidly. If the Company does not pay sufficient attention to public opinion, public relations to the crisis are not dealt 

with in a timely manner, and failure to disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public, it will damage the 

Company’s reputation, brand and image, and adversely affect the business and prospects of the Company.

The  Company  has  set  up  professional  public  relations  department  and  teams  for  crisis  management,  with  public 

relations  management  mechanism  established.  The  teams  have  maintained  close  interaction  with  management  and 

business groups. The teams gather public opinions, analyse and identify relevant information and report their analysis 

to  management  to  more  promptly  and  appropriately  respond  to  the  public  according  to  the  Company’s  policies  and 

procedures.

93

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance Report8.  Acquisition and investment management risk

The  Company  has  a  certain  scale  of  investment  activities  in  diverse  fields.  It  is  important  for  the  Company  to  adopt 

robust procedures in the formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment 

evaluation stage as well as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly manage investment risks could hinder the 

realization of investment strategies.

The  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously,  and  has,  amongst  other  things,  established  an 

Investment Committee under the Board, dedicated an investment team to identify investment opportunities, appointed 

finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  manage  relevant  risks  and  put  in  place  the  investment  risk 

evaluation  and  approval  process.  There  is  also  a  designated  professional  team  that  regularly  reviews  the  Company’s 

cash position and, continuously expands its financing channels and capabilities to meet the needs from the Company’s 

business  operations  as  well  as  acquisitions.  The  Company  has  also  designated  finance,  legal  and  other  relevant 

professional teams to support and monitor the performance of the investee companies. These teams periodically analyse 

and review relevant operating and financial information of the investee companies to ensure that they continue to satisfy 

the Company’s investment strategies. In addition, the Company has invested resources in internal audit and internal 

control to empower investee companies, and to continuously support the management of its controlling subsidiaries in 

establishing more sound risk management and internal control systems.

9.  Fraud risk

In  recent  years,  fraudulent  activities  have  occurred  frequently  in  the  technology,  media  and  telecom  industry  and 

therefore  integrity  has  become  an  industrial  concern.  With  the  business  development  of  the  Company,  the  business 

scale and complexity have been evolved, and consequently the fraud risk inevitably increased in a certain degree. For 

example,  fraudulent  activities  caused  by  collusion  between  suppliers/business  partners  and  employees  can  have  a 

negative impact on reputation and finance of the Company.

94

Tencent Holdings Limited

Corporate Governance ReportThe Company, with its belief in the value of integrity, has zero tolerance for fraud, and is determined to fight against 

any fraudulent activities. The Company has established effective internal control systems and is continuously improving 

it. These systems have been strengthened by systematic, transparent control methods. To enhance the awareness of 

integrity, the Company continuously conducts various training and propaganda for its employees and suppliers/business 

partners.  For  employees,  the  Company  has  established  the  Sunshine  Code  that  the  employees  shall  strictly  follow 

during their employment and in the course of business dealing with suppliers/business partners. For suppliers/business 

partners, the Company cooperates with them to create an ecosystem with integrity. To build up a healthy and transparent 

business environment, the suppliers/business partners are required to sign the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration. 

Furthermore, the Company has set up the anti-fraud investigation department for years to collect whistleblowing cases 

from multiple channels, and to follow up and investigate alleged fraudulent cases on a timely basis. The Company will 

terminate the employment immediately with any employee who has been found involved in any fraudulent activities. 

The Company may also pass the relevant case for juridical process according to the relevant laws under more serious 

circumstances. Any supplier/business partner found to be involved in any fraudulent activities will be blacklisted and 

deprived of the opportunity to work with the Company permanently.

Internal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems,  and  has  been  implementing  the  COSO 

Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure their appropriateness and effectiveness.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define roles and responsibilities of each party as well as authorisations and 

approvals  required  for  key  actions  of  the  Company.  Policies  and  procedures  are  in  place  for  the  key  business  processes. 

This information is also clearly conveyed to employees in practice and plays an important role in internal control systems. All 

employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational issues that set 

the control standards for the management of each business process.

95

Annual Report 2018Corporate Governance ReportIn  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  the  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework  and 

guides the management of each business group to carry out the self-assessment. The IC is also responsible for collecting 

and summarising the results of self-assessment. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company reviews this summarised self- 

assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of the senior management team of the Company to the Audit Committee and 

the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensures that management has implemented appropriate measures and reports the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control

The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, continuously reviews the risk management and internal control systems.

The review process comprises, among other things, of meetings with management of business groups, IA, IC, legal team, and 

the external auditor, reviewing the relevant work reports and information of key performance indicators, the management self- 

assessment on internal control as detailed above and discussing the major risks with the senior management of the Company.

The  Board  is  of  the  view  that  throughout  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  the  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems of the Company are effective and adequate.

In  addition,  the  Board  believes  that  the  Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  functions  have  been  performed  by 

staff  of  the  appropriate  qualifications  and  experience  and  that  such  staff  receives  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and 

development. Based on the audit report of the Audit Committee, the Board also believes that sufficient resources have been 

obtained for the Company’s internal audit function and that its staff qualifications and experience, training programmes and 

budgets are sufficient.

Corporate Governance ReportSHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of the 

Group’s operations, businesses and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in  annual  general  meetings  and  other  general  meetings  or  other  proper  means.  As  such,  the  Company  sends  notices  to 

shareholders for annual general meetings at least 20 clear business days before the meeting and at least 10 clear business 

days for all other general meetings. In addition, the Company has developed and maintains the shareholders communication 

policy, which is available on the Company Website.

The Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board and the senior management team. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the 

senior management team, under normal circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to 

the Company in an open manner. Save as Mr Li Dong Sheng, all directors attended the 2018 annual general meeting held 

on 16 May 2018, with a view to understanding the views of the Company’s shareholders. The company secretary provided 

the minutes of 2018 annual general meeting to all directors to have a thorough understanding of the views of the Company’s 

shareholders.  The  Company’s  external  auditor  will  also  attend  the  annual  general  meeting  to  answer  questions  relating  to 

the  conduct  of  the  audit,  the  auditor’s  report  and  auditor  independence.  The  Company’s  shareholders  may  also  propose 

candidates for election as a director of the Company according to the following procedures, details of which are also set out on 

the Company Website.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the

the  Company  shall  at  all  times  have  the  right,  by  written  requisition  to  the  Board  or  the  company  secretary,  to  require  an 

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, a separate resolution will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure that the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a 

poll, detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions 

from  shareholders  on  the  voting  procedures  will  be  answered  before  the  poll  voting  starts.  An  external  scrutineer  will  be 

appointed to  monitor and count the votes cast by poll. Poll results will be posted on the Company  Website and the Stock 

Exchange’s website after each general meeting.

Apart from participating in the Company’s general meetings, the Company’s shareholders are provided with contact details of 

the Company such as telephone number and email address which are available on the Company Website, in order to enable 

them  to  make  any  query  that  they  may  have.  Shareholders  may  send  their  enquiries  to  the  Board  directly  through  these

Our  ESG  strategy  requires  the  participation  of  all  of  our  product  lines  and  platforms,  and  participation  from  across  the 

wider Internet industry. We will continue to place more emphasis on ESG, and encourage every individual, enterprise and 

organisation to take part in the implementation of our ESG strategy.

“Internet+” has significant implications for our ESG initiatives. Important changes can be achieved through connecting millions 

of Internet users as well as developing their modes of communication and living, and creating more exciting opportunities 

for  society.  In  addition,  through  the “smart  living”  system  in  QQ  and  Weixin/WeChat,  people  and  public  services  can  be 

digitally connected, which in effect facilitate developments in transport, healthcare, environmental protection, public safety 

and  other  social  arenas.  This  is  important  for  optimising  the  distribution  of  societal  resources,  driving  innovation  in  public 

services, improving service quality, breaking down communication barriers and ultimately benefiting the wider community. 

We will leverage our core capability in the Internet, technology and communication spheres to develop innovative approaches 

to resolving social issues, promoting social development and protecting the interests of the public. We also aim to drive ESG 

awareness in society, through collaborating with our stakeholders and other industry players.

Going  forward,  we  will  continue  to  enhance  our  corporate  management  system  and  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  our 

operations. We will closely cooperate with our stakeholders with the aim of creating a better future.

ENVIRONMENT

We recognise the importance of environmental protection and conservation of natural resources in our business operations. 

Starting from our office buildings in Shenzhen, we have implemented a number of energy-saving measures and we plan to 

adopt  the  same  in  our  office  spaces  in  other  locations.  We  have  also  strived  to  build  our  data  centres  with  environmental 

considerations as one of our key priorities.

Energy Saving Measures taken in our New Office Building

We  have  taken  environmental  protection  as  one  of  our  priorities  when  designing  our  new  office  building,  Tencent  Binhai 

Building, in Shenzhen. The construction has been certified as attaining LEED-NC Gold Standard and the building has been 

under operation in accordance with LEED-EB standards. The property management company of the Shenzhen headquarters 

has  obtained  ISO  14001  (environmental  management)  certification,  ISO  9001  (quality  management)  certification  and  GB/

T 23331 (energy management system) certification. We have also implemented various measures to enhance efficiency of 

energy use and reduce water consumption and emissions.

We  have  optimised  the  air  conditioning  system  and  the  integrated  building  management  system  in  order  to  automate  the 

energy saving and monitoring process. The air conditioning system uses pumps controlled by frequency-conversion technology 

for  the  enhancement  of  energy  efficiency.  We  have  also  reduced  energy  consumption  of  the  air  conditioning  system  by 

partially deploying natural ventilation in autumn and winter. We have also adopted a smart lighting system which allows remote 

automatic control over the lighting in the office area for the purpose of energy conservation.

Our  new  office  building  has  adopted  a  centralised  system  to  collect,  purify  and  recycle  condensed  water  from  the  air 

conditioning system, and water from drinking water system, showers and cooling towers, for the purposes of flushing, watering 

plants and cleaning the parking lot. In addition, we have installed a direct drinking water system in replacement of bottled 

water. It reduces the use of plastic packaging materials and indirectly reduces the CO2 emissions generated from the delivery 

of bottled water.

We monitor the levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitro dioxide 

inside and outside Tencent Building with an online monitoring system and display the data on a real-time basis. To ensure 

the air quality in the building, we have installed induced ventilation system (which regulates the ventilation automatically in 

response to the level of carbon monoxide) in the underground parking garage and fresh air ventilation system (which regulates 

the  ventilation  automatically  in  response  to  the  level  of  carbon  dioxide)  in  the  office  area.  We  have  upgraded  the  kitchen 

ventilation units in the kitchens in our office building. The units comprise fire-resistant environmental friendly exhaust hoods to 

remove oil and purify air with photolysis purification function and the activated carbon filter and air ioniser to neutralise odors. 

The emission of cooking fumes is in compliance with the PRC national standards GB18483-2001.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEnergy Saving Measures taken in our Data Centres

We endeavour to fulfil our responsibility to protect the environment by applying innovative technology to our data centres and 

be the exemplar of green data centres in the PRC industry.

T-block technology (comprising (i) photovoltaic + High Voltage Direct Current (“HVDC”) technology for electrical design; (ii) 

indirect evaporative cooling units; (iii) Tnebula smart control system; and (iv) fully commercialised project delivery solution) has 

been used in the fourth generation of our data centres, including the new data centre in Shenzhen, Gui’an and Chongqing.

We have adopted the T-base large-scale data centre campus construction model which has placed us at the leading position 

in  terms  of  the  efficient  use  of  space  and  the  standardisation  of  the  construction  process.  It  does  not  only  shorten  the 

construction cycle but also minimise the impact on the environment and increase the power usage effectiveness (“PUE”) of 

our data centres. The annual average PUE of our data centres which are located in a low-altitude climate zone (including the 

one in Shenzhen) is below 1.25. Our new data centre in Gui’an is an advanced data centre with a high level of privacy, defence 

and security. It completed the test run during which the PUE was 1.12. We expect that it will serve as a highly reliable and 

environmentally friendly data centre for our Group and our business partners. We have achieved standardised application of 

the T-block technology in this project.

We have shared our experience and technology in building green data centres with other industry players so that HVDC, micro 

module and indirect evaporative cooling technologies have been widely adopted in the PRC data centre business. We have 

also helped to establish the industry standards for HVDC and micro module technologies in order to enhance energy saving 

efforts among the industry players. In the future, we will further promote T-block technology. We will strive to enhance the 

power usage effectiveness while improving the efficiency of the data centre construction process.

The Group’s GHG inventory includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. GHG emissions data is presented in carbon 
dioxide equivalent and is based on the “2015 Baseline Emission Factors for Regional Power Grids in China” issued by the National 
Development and Reform Commission of China, and the “2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” issued by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scope of GHG emission data covers the Group’s office buildings located 
in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu and Wuhan, and the main data centres which were built over the past four 

years in Mainland China.

Diesel was consumed for backup generators.

Hazardous waste produced by the Group’s operation mainly includes waste toner cartridge and waste ink cartridge from printing 
equipment at office buildings, as well as waste lead-acid accumulators at data centres. Waste toner cartridge and waste ink 
cartridge are collected and disposed of by printing suppliers, whereas lead-acid accumulators are disposed of by qualified waste 

recycling vendors. In 2018, there were no waste lead-acid accumulators.

Non-hazardous  waste  produced  by  the  Group’s  operation  mainly  includes  domestic  waste  and  non-hazardous  office  waste. 
Domestic waste is disposed of by the property management company and kitchen waste recycling vendors, and its data is not 
available for statistics, so we made estimation of domestic waste produced at the Group’s office buildings located in Shenzhen, 
Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu and Wuhan with reference to  “Handbook on Domestic Discharge Coefficiencies for 
Towns in the First Nationwide Census on Contaminant Discharge” published by the State Council. Non-hazardous office waste is 
recycled by waste recycling vendors.

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWORKPLACE

Employee Development and Training

We have a well-established performance management system. A performance assessment for each employee is conducted by 

that employee’s supervisor every six months and employees are required to work with their supervisors to set a performance 

target after each assessment. Supervisors are encouraged to provide constructive feedback from time to time to assist the 

personal growth of each employee.

As  our  staff  is  one  of  our  most  important  assets,  we  invest  heavily  in  employee  development  and  training.  We  encourage 

employees to attend external and internal trainings. We have adopted relevant policies to ensure that employee trainings are 

provided and managed in a systematic manner. For example, supervisors are required to assist in designing the professional 

development plans for the employees and evaluate the effectiveness of the trainings received by the employees. To ensure the 

quality of the trainings, we have also developed policies which set out requirements for the qualifications and experience of the 

instructors and the objectives of the programmes and worked with external educational institutions from time to time to jointly 

develop training programmes.

In 2007, we founded our own corporate university, Tencent Academy. It offers different training programmes for each stage of 

an employee’s career, including an induction, on-the-job training and leadership training. It has also set up an online learning 

platform and a mobile learning system in order to allow employees to learn anytime and anywhere. In 2017, one of our training 

programmes won the ATD Excellence in Practice Award by the Association for Talent Development.

As at 31 December 2018, there were approximately 700 face-to-face courses, 7,400 online courses and over 1,000 internal 

part-time instructors. Over the past decade, we ran face-to-face courses over 8,000 times per year and over 1,500 courses 

were livestreamed per year. The aggregate number of training hours of our employees in the past 10 years exceeds 5 million. 

Throughout 2018, the number of the average in-house training hours per employee was 37.1 and the percentage of employees 

who received training is 99%.

We also intend to open up our training resources to our business partners and industry players in order to enhance the market 

standard.

109

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEqual Opportunities and Diversity

We had 54,309 employees as at 31 December 2018. Our employment practice is in compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations  (including  but  not  limited  to  those  which  prohibit  child  and  forced  labour)  and  does  not  discriminate  on  the 

grounds of gender, ethnicity, race, disability, age, religious belief, sexual orientation or family status. Diversity is well supported 

in our corporate culture.

The recruitment process strictly abides by the guidelines of the Group’s Human Resources Department. Every job applicant 

is  required  to  provide  information  on  his/her  education  background,  qualification  and  job  experience  in  a  recruitment 

questionnaire, which is reviewed by Human Resources Department and verified by professional background check agency. 

This allows the Group to hire suitable candidate in accordance with the job requirements and, to the extent possible, avoid 

child and forced labour.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation

We  offer  competitive  pay  and  employee  benefits  to  attract  and  retain  talent.  The  remuneration  and  bonus  system  is 

performance-based and designed to reward employees with high performance and great potential.

Benefits

The basic benefits system was built and is maintained in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and market practice. In 

addition, certain special benefits are created to motivate employees and implement our strategy.

We were awarded by zhaopin.com as the best employer in the PRC in 2018. We have also been voted as one of the best 

employers in the PRC for 13 consecutive years since 2006 in a survey jointly conducted by zhaopin.com and the Institute of 

Social Science Survey, Peking University.

We care for the growth of our employees and provide benefits with Tencent characteristics to our employees. For example, 

we celebrate special occasions of our employees (e.g. work anniversary, wedding and festivities). We strive to create work-

life balance and a safe and comfortable work environment for employees. Employees have the flexibility to choose the most 

suitable insurance plans and benefits for themselves and their families.

Promotion

Employees may apply for promotion during their interim and year-end performance reviews, provided  that they satisfy the 

requirements with regard to the length of service and performance. Depending on the practice area, the promotion will be 

reviewed and considered by different internal committees. The promotion review process is fair and open – there is a formal 

channel for our employees to provide and receive feedback. The promotion review is conducted in compliance with applicable 

laws and regulations.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEmployee Departure

All of our employees enter into written employment contracts which detail, among other things, the grounds for termination of 

the employment.

We value our relationship with our employees and handle employee departure (whether by resignation or dismissal) strictly 

in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We arrange an exit interview with each of the departing employees to 

understand the reasons for his/her departure and welcome any suggestions for improvement.

Work-Life Balance

We have implemented various initiatives such as flexi-time arrangements and volunteer service leave to help employees strike 

a good work-life balance. The leave scheme allows employees to enjoy annual leave, fully-paid sick leave, half-paid leave of 

absence and fully-paid special Chinese New Year leave which are above the statutory standard. Also, female employees are 

entitled to take fully-paid maternity leave, while male employees are also entitled to take fully-paid paternity leave. Employees 

can also apply for one day of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

We  also  organise  a  wide  variety  of  recreational  and  leisure  activities  (e.g.  running,  photography,  music,  dance,  language 

classes) for employees.

Occupational Health and Safety

We strive to provide a safe and comfortable work environment for our employees. There are well-established security and fire 

service systems and food safety monitoring system.

We have a designated team in charge of the physical and mental health of employees. We arrange annual medical checkups 

for  employees  and  organise  health  seminars,  fitness  sessions,  on-site  medical  consultations  as  well  as  face-to-face  and 

telephone counselling from time to time.

Our contribution to social insurance in the PRC is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and we offer various 

supplemental  insurance  benefits  to  employees  and  their  families  (including  medical  insurance,  critical  illness  insurance, 

accident insurance and life insurance).

Communication

We  strive  to  create  casual  yet  sophisticated  communication  channels  with  customised  contents  for  our  employees.  There 

are  annual  rallies  for  employees  and  management,  face-to-face  discussion  forums,  featured  magazines  and  social  media 

platforms. The corporate strategy and culture are communicated and reinforced through these products and communication 

channels.

Community Investment

We  set  up  the  Tencent  Charity  Foundation  (the  “Tencent  Foundation”)  on  26  June  2007.  It  is  a  non-public  fundraising 

foundation incorporated in the PRC and a separate legal entity. We commit to donating certain portion of our profits to the 

Tencent Foundation every year for the purpose of supporting charitable works. As of 31 December 2018, our Group and our 

employees donated approximately RMB3.5 billion and RMB68 million in total to the Tencent Foundation respectively since 

its establishment. During the year 2018, our Group and our employees donated RMB730 million and RMB840,000 to the 

Tencent Foundation respectively.

The Tencent Foundation believes that everyone can participate in charity work anytime and anywhere through technology. 

In June 2007, the Tencent Foundation leveraged on our Internet technical capabilities and online platforms to build the first 

online public fundraising platform. It is designed, developed and operated by the Tencent Foundation while we provide server, 

broadband  and  other  technical  support  for  free.  The  platform  is  open  for  eligible  charitable  organisations  free  of  charge. 

It  allows  charitable  works  to  be  performed  more  conveniently,  smoothly  and  transparently.  This  is  a  good  example  of  the 

application of the concept of “Internet+”. As of 31 December 2018, there had been over 6,000 active charitable organisations 

and close to 16,000 charity projects in different locations with different focuses.

The Tencent Foundation has also applied technology to various charitable initiatives such as WeCountry for rural development 

and Tencent Three-dimensional Disaster Relief Programme in response to recent natural  disasters in China via  the  online 

platform. In 2018, the total number of donations made by the Internet users was approximately 69 million and the total amount 

of the funds raised was over RMB1.7 billion.

The  highlight  of  the  Tencent  Foundation’s  charity  efforts  is  the  annual  “99  Charity  Day”  campaign  where  it  matches  the 

donations made by the Internet users between 7 September and 9 September via its online platform. In 2018, the Tencent 

Foundation donated RMB300 million for the campaign, of which 35.2% was for education initiatives, 34.5% for medical care, 

26.1% for poverty relief and the remaining 4.2% was for environmental protection initiatives and others.

In addition to promoting philanthropy through the online charity platform, the Tencent Foundation makes direct donation in the 

following areas: (i) disaster relief; (ii) rural development; (iii) education; (iv) ecological conservation and cultural preservation; (v) 

community development; and (vi) poverty relief.

Disaster relief

In response to the recent natural disasters in the PRC as well as globally, the Tencent Foundation has created a multifaceted 

disaster  relief  model  by  combining  our  various  products  including  online  platforms,  instant  messengers,  online  payment 

and Internet search to help the public follow the latest news, participate in rescue efforts and make donations. In addition, 

the Tencent Foundation has made donations to support the rescue missions and post-disaster reconstructions. In 2018, it 

donated an aggregate of approximately RMB4.5 million to the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, the China Children and 

Teenagers’ Fund and other charitable organisations in response to the earthquake in Xinjiang and the landslides in Sichuan 

and for the post-disaster child care programme following the earthquake in Ya’an city.

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportRural development

In  2015,  WeCountry,  our  open  platform  built  on  the “Internet  +  Village”  model,  was  launched  to  offer  villagers  access  to 

digital technology which would benefit their communities. As of 31 December 2018, 28 provincial administrative areas with 

approximately 10,000 villages (or communities) joined WeCountry platform. The number of verified villagers was approximately 

2.34 million as of 31 December 2018.

Education

The Tencent Foundation has set up scholarships to promote education in the PRC and other countries throughout the years. 

There are also specific donations for different education initiatives. In 2018, the Tencent Foundation donated approximately 

RMB119 million in education related projects. For example, it had cooperations with the funds set up by universities (including 

Peking  University,  Shenzhen  University  and  Nanjing  University)  on  higher  education  and  with  UNICEF  on  cybersecurity 

education. It also sponsored the projects led by Beijing Hefeng Art Foundation in relation to online art education.

Ecological conservation and cultural preservation

The  Tencent  Foundation  is  keen  on  environmental  protection  and  cultural  preservation.  In  2018,  the  Tencent  Foundation 

donated approximately RMB5.8 million to the China Foundation For Cultural Heritage Conservation, the Paradise International 

Foundation  and  other  ecological  conservation  organisations  to  continue  to  preserve  and  repair  the  Great  Wall  and  for  the 

ecological conservation project in the PRC.

In 2018, the Tencent Foundation raised approximately RMB120 million on the “99 Charity Day” to promote philanthropy and 

innovation in charity work.

Poverty relief

In 2018, the Tencent Foundation donated approximately RMB125 million to support poverty relief initiatives through various 

charitable organisations, in addition to the matching donation made by the Tencent Foundation on the “99 Charity Day” on the 

same area.

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportVolunteering

In  2006,  some  of  our  employees  founded  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  on  their  own  initiative  in  response  to  our 

corporate  vision  of  being  “the  most  respected  Internet  company”.  Since  then,  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  has 

contributed more than 120,000 hours of voluntary services and the total number of participants is more than 60,000. There 

are more than 20 sub-divisions at the city level (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Guangzhou and 

Hefei) and at the regional level (such as Hebei, Guangdong, Guizhou, Gansu and Yunnan).

Over the last decade, the Tencent Volunteer’s Association has been involved and contributed in the areas of online charity, 

promotion of unhindered Internet access, information technology popularisation, cybersecurity, emergency support, poverty 

relief,  scholarship,  environmental  protection,  care  for  elderly  and  children  with  special  needs  and  animal  protection.  It 

has  launched  more  than  200  volunteering  activities.  In  2016,  it  was  awarded  a  spot  in  the  list  of  Top  10  Best  Volunteer 

Organisations in Guangdong Province.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association combines its expertise in technology to help the community. For example, it has been 

broadcasting information on missing persons via Weixin/WeChat and QQ and with the latest facial recognition and blockchain 

technologies, the number of successful cases increased year by year.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association also established the China IT-Philanthropy Union which promotes the “Internet + Charity” 

model by holding summits and publishing white papers on the successful examples of how the information technology has 

changed the landscape of charity work.

In order to encourage employees to participate in volunteer service, employees, since April 2012, have been granted one day 

of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

Anti-Corruption

Tencent embraces the value of integrity, proactivity, collaboration and innovation. To promote integrity, we have developed 

robust  systems  and  measures  to  prevent,  detect  and  deter  corruption  or  any  other  fraudulent  activities.  Internal  audit  is 

conducted  and  risk  management  and  risk  control  have  been  further  strengthened  to  ensure  the  Group’s  compliance  with 

ethical standards which we promote and strive to uphold.

114

Tencent Holdings Limited

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportRisk Management and Internal Control Policy

In 2016, we updated the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy (the “Policy”) with a system comprising three lines of 

defence. The first line is business and functional departments. The risk management and internal control departments serve 

as the second line while the internal audit department and anti-fraud investigation department act as the third line of defence. 

The Policy sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in risk management and control (including those 

in relation to frauds). It is emphasised in the Policy that the management of each business  group  is primarily responsible 

for the risk management and internal controls of its department. If any fraudulent activity is detected, the management of 

the relevant department shall improve the control procedures promptly to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The risk 

management and internal control departments have dedicated a team to each business group to provide internal control and 

risk management support. We also apply continuous auditing to key businesses in order to detect irregularities and identify 

risks in a timely and systematic manner and to improve the effectiveness of fraud risk management and control.

Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct

All employees of the entire Group are required to follow and to strictly comply with the Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct (the 

“Sunshine Code”). It expressly prohibits all kinds of fraudulent activities, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation, extortion, 

falsification  of  information  and  any  other  activities  which  are  not  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  The 

Sunshine Code shall be reviewed annually against the changing needs of the Group and revised when appropriate, in order to 

ensure that it caters for our business development, reflects the positions under applicable laws and regulations and captures 

all kinds of fraudulent activities. In 2018, we have revised the Sunshine Code to include more specific stipulations in relation to 

each category of fraudulent activities so that our employees can understand better our expectations under the Sunshine Code. 

The revised Sunshine Code emphasises the responsibilities of the management. The immediate supervisor will be demoted 

if an employee under his management has committed a fraudulent act as a result of deficiency in the management process, 

unclear delineation of responsibilities or loopholes in the business operation. The immediate supervisor will also be required 

to  come  up  with  a  remedial  plan  with  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  departments  and  implement  such  plan 

within three months. The Internal Audit Committee has the discretion to make the final decision on whether such immediate 

supervisor can be resumed to his original role after the implementation of the remedial plan.

In 2018, in order to ensure our employees comply with the requirements and ethical standards stipulated in the Sunshine 

Code, we have requested all employees to complete the e-learning programme with a view to understanding the updated rules 

and standards of the Sunshine Code. For positions with high risk of fraud, they are required to attend face-to-face training 

course at least once a year. We also promote job rotation for these employees on a regular basis in order to minimise the risk of 

fraud.

115

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy

We have published an Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy (the “Whistleblowing Policy”), which clearly conveys the message 

of zero tolerance  in relation to fraudulent activity to all the employees and suppliers/business partners.  All employees  and 

suppliers/business partners are encouraged to report genuine concerns about any existing or potential fraudulent activities and 

non-compliance. The Whistleblowing Policy expressly outlines the multiple whistleblowing channels and how the Group should 

deal with such concerns, so that employees and suppliers/business partners can report their good faith concerns without fear 

of reprisal or potential retaliation. Since 2016, we have maintained an Official Account under the name of “Sunshine Tencent” 

on Weixin to promote our anti-fraud policy and whistleblowing channels with a function to allow our business partners to report 

directly to us.

Fraud Detection and Corruption Prevention

When  a  report  of  suspected  fraudulent  activities  is  received,  the  anti-fraud  investigation  department,  which  consists  of 

professionals who used to be part of the anti-corruption function at a governmental authority or private enterprise and have 

profound knowledge in fraud risk management and solid fraud investigation experiences, is assigned to handle the investigation 

independently. After an investigation has been completed, the employee found and proven to have committed such fraud 

shall be subject to immediate dismissal. At the same time, the department in question must, with the assistance of the risk 

management and internal control departments, take corrective actions in response to the business risk or loophole identified 

during the investigation. If we find any supplier or business partner engaging in corruption or any other fraudulent activities, 

we will terminate the contracts with them immediately and never work with them again. In the event that any fraudulent activity 

violates any relevant laws or regulations, such cases shall be reported to government authorities in accordance with applicable 

laws and regulations. In order to convey a message regarding our determination to fight against fraud and to introduce our 

whistleblowing system externally, we send a letter to our suppliers and business partners and request them to complete a 

questionnaire annually. The questionnaire sets out our corporate values, the Whistleblowing Policy and the various reporting 

channels. We will understand from each of our suppliers and our business partners whether our employees have requested for 

any gift, cash or benefit during the course of business and whether it has been treated unfairly. Upon receipt of the feedback, 

we will ensure that the questions or concerns raised by our suppliers and our business partners will be addressed promptly. If 

necessary, the anti-fraud investigation department will commence an investigation formally.

Our risk management and internal control departments have established a procurement management control unit to optimise 

the Group’s supplier management system. A new supplier synergy system has been launched for the online management of 

the entire procurement life cycle, from sourcing, selection and onboarding of suppliers, performance assessment to retiring 

suppliers. The system serves as an open platform where the suppliers can provide its corporate information to us and we 

can manage the entire bidding process online. Through a centralised system, the bidding process can be standardised and 

become  more  transparent.  The  supplier  management  system  also  provides  the  suppliers  with  a  communication  channel 

so that we can collect their feedback or complaints. Complaints in relation to fraudulent activities will be passed to the anti-

fraud investigation department directly for follow-up and those non-fraud related complaints (such as unfair treatment) will be 

handled by the procurement risk management unit. The goal is to ensure that the complaints and concerns of our suppliers 

can be addressed promptly and the risk of fraud can be minimised.

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-Money Laundering

The  Group  is  subject  to  and  strictly  abides  by  applicable  laws  and  regulations  in  relation  to  cross-border  and  domestic 

money  transmission,  anti-money  laundering  (“AML”)  as  well  as  counter-terrorist  financing  (“CFT”)  in  the  PRC  and  other 

countries where we provide payment processing services. We have fulfilled not only our legal obligations but also our social 

responsibilities.

As a result of the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance in multiple jurisdictions, we have dedicated more resources 

(including  but  not  limited  to  human  resources  and  system  capabilities)  to  the  compliance  work  in  the  following  areas:  (i) 

recruiting more AML/CFT professionals for the know-your-customer process, suspicious transaction review and analysis, and 

system  infrastructure  enhancement  in  order  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  and  professionalism  of  AML/CFT  measures;  (ii) 

strengthening the implementation of internal control measures in relation to sanctions compliance in order to minimise the 

relevant risks; (iii) enhancing the cooperation with regulators and law enforcement bodies on AML investigations; (iv) actively 

participating in the combats against money laundering, terrorism, tax evasion and corruption activities internationally, in order 

to prevent money laundering and upstream criminal activities; and (v) carrying out various forms of training, education, and 

public relation activities on AML for our executives, employees and users.

In  2018,  Tencent  has  established  an  Anti-Money  Laundering  Programme  (the  “AML  Programme”)  to  ensure  that  money 

laundering risks identified by Tencent are appropriately mitigated and to protect Tencent, its employees, shareholders and 

users  from  money  laundering  risks.  The  AML  Programme  provides  guidance  to  all  Tencent  employees,  requiring  them  to 

conduct business in accordance with applicable AML laws, rules and regulations.

The key aspects of the AML Programme include but are not limited to the following:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

Appointing AML specialists at global and country levels;

Establishing a comprehensive Customer Due Diligence Programme;

Establishing processes and systems which are designed to monitor customer transactions for the purpose of identifying 

suspicious activities;

Investigating and subsequently reporting suspicious activities to the applicable regulatory bodies;

Conducting regular independent testing on our AML system and providing regular AML trainings to our employees and 

counterparties; and

Prohibiting the onboarding of any anonymous users or users using an obviously fictitious name for our services.

117

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Our  supply  chain  management  programme  attaches  supreme  importance  to  managing  the  ethics  risk  associated  with  the 

relationship between our procurement employees and our business partners. It also focuses on teaching those employees who 

are involved in procurement to recognise and mitigate the inherent risks.

To  enhance  the  social  responsibility  awareness  of  our  employees,  we  have  formulated  a  code  of  conduct  which  those 

employees engaging in procurement activities must adhere to. To minimise the ethics risks, such employees are also required 

to declare any relationship they may have with our suppliers in writing.

In  the  course  of  supplier  engagement,  potential  suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  self-assessment  on  their  commitment, 

amongst other things, to environmental protection, social responsibility, and health and safety at work (the “Self-Assessment”).

Suppliers which are formally engaged by us are also required to agree to the terms of a declaration and undertaking in relation 

to anti-commercial bribery in doing business with our Group (the “Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration”).

During the year ended 31 December 2018, all suppliers which were formally engaged had completed the Self-Assessment 

and signed the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration. We were not aware of any material commercial bribery engaged by our 

suppliers.

The procurement department looks for qualified suppliers in the market and conducts standard or simplified verification on the 

suppliers depending on the duration of the cooperation, the order volume and the nature of the request. We have maintained a 

database of qualified suppliers which are ready to take orders from us.

We have an internal policy which sets out the procedures for supplier onboarding. Before engaging a supplier, we will form 

a supplier assessment team to conduct the background check (including site visit) on the supplier. The team will consist of 

members from the procurement department, the requesting department, the technology department (if applicable) and the risk 

management department. The assessment results will be reported to the procurement department for a final determination.

We normally ask for price quotations from at least three vendors. Other factors including delivery time and technical capabilities 

of the vendors will be taken into consideration when selecting vendors. If there is only one vendor available for selection as it 

dominates the relevant market or it is the only vendor with access to the required goods/services, the exclusive procurement 

arrangement  with  such  vendor  will  require  special  approval  with  a  satisfactory  justification  provided  by  the  technology 

department or the requesting department.

We evaluate the performance of our suppliers from time to time and take appropriate steps to address any issues with the 

quality of the suppliers as part of our supply chain management. For suppliers with unsatisfactory performance, subject to 

applicable contractual arrangements, we may (i) discuss with them on the remedial steps to be taken by them; (ii) suspend the 

cooperation; (iii) reduce the order volume; (iv) impose penalties; or (v) suspend payment. The procurement department may 

disqualify a supplier for the following events: (i) we suffer from material economic losses as a result of the delayed delivery, 

quality issue or breach of contract by the supplier; (ii) the supplier has received the lowest rating in the rating scale for two 

consecutive quarters; and (iii) the supplier has in serious breach of business ethics.

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportPRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

We strive to provide the best user experience and pay high attention to the quality of our products and services. We conduct 

strict reviews of our product and service offerings and related sales, marketing and advertising strategies and materials  to 

ensure their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We also build in safeguards on user privacy, product safety and 

IP rights as described below.

User Privacy

To uphold our dedication to value creation for our users, amongst other user specific aims, one of our important missions is to 

protect the privacy of user data and other sensitive information. We comply with all applicable laws on privacy protection, and 

incorporate applicable legal and regulatory requirements on privacy protection into our internal compliance policies taking into 

account the specific features of our products and services. We have also devised specific procedures to collect and process 

user data to ensure that our products and services are in compliance with applicable legal requirements.

We have a dedicated privacy team within the Legal Department which is responsible for handling data protection matters. We 

evaluate specific products from the perspective of privacy protection on a regular basis and perform privacy risk assessments 

before the launch of new products to ensure that our products are not exposed to the risk of privacy infringement or leakage of 

user data.

We provide training to our employees to enhance their privacy protection awareness and build up the cultural awareness of the 

importance of privacy protection.

To ensure that our users understand how we protect their personal information and enhance  the  transparency of how  we 

collect  and  process  the  data,  we  promote  the  concept  of “Data  for  Social  Good”.  We  have  published  the  Tencent  Privacy 

Protection  Whitepaper  and  launched  the  Tencent  Privacy  Platform  (https://www.qq.com/privacy.htm)  to  give  our  users  a 

comprehensive  understanding of the privacy protection measures  taken by Tencent. We also  make our  privacy  protection 

policies available on our product websites and in-app products, and provide communication channels for our users to file 

complaints and raise enquiries whenever they are in doubt.

The  privacy  policies  of  our  various  applications  have  been  considered  top-ranked  in  the  joint  review  by  the  Cyberspace 

Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, the Ministry of Public Security of 

the PRC and the Standardisation Administration of the PRC and in the review by China Consumers Association among 100 

selected applications. Furthermore, we actively participate in shaping the development of the industry framework on privacy 

protection. For example, we are a member of the International Association of Privacy Professionals. Many of our products have 

been accredited with privacy certifications from TrustArc. Our network and data security managements have been recognised 

in the PRC and internationally and ISO certified.

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportCustomer Service

The Tencent Customer Service Centre consists of more than 2,500 staff members and is responsible for handling complaints 

and responding to enquiries from customers for our businesses. We commit to providing solutions to our customers in a timely 

manner through different means including customer service hotline, online customer support, intelligent customer service, 

Weixin/WeChat and face-to-face meeting.

We have established the following management system to handle complaints from our customers effectively:

1. 

There is a designated team within the customer service department to handle complaints and deal with compensation 

requests. The team is responsible for conducting investigation based on the information provided by the complainant, 

explaining the relevant procedures to the complainant and notifying the complainant of the investigation results with the 

aim of providing him with a satisfactory solution.

2. 

For  better  user  experience,  we  have  established  a  set  of  complaint  handling  procedures  which  set  out  clearly  the 

responsibilities  within  the  customer  service  department  and  the  timeframe  within  which  a  complaint  needs  to  be 

resolved.

3.  We have strengthened our system infrastructure which allows classification of complaints by urgency and risk level so 

that the customer service staff can better prioritise the cases and deal with the complaints in a timely manner.

4.  We have a designated team of staff who is responsible for handling complaints from customers who visit our offices and 

for better risk control, we have designed a set of protocols for different types of incidents.

Healthy Environment for our Users

One  of  our  important  businesses  is  our  online  gaming  business.  We  need  to  comply  with  the  laws,  regulations  and  policy 

requirements in relation to online gaming in the PRC.

The authorities in the PRC which regulate online gaming mainly include: (i) the State Administration of Press and Publication; (ii) 

the Ministry of Culture and Tourism; (iii) the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (iv) the State Administration 

for Market Regulation.

The laws, regulations and policies relating to online gaming mainly include: (i) “The Regulation on Internet Information Service 

of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China”  promulgated  by  the  State  Council;  (ii)  “The  Provisions  on  the  Administration  of  Online 

Publishing Services” promulgated by the former State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the 

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (iii) “The Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Culture”, 

“The Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Games” and “The Notice on Regulating Online Game Operation and 

Strengthening Concurrent and Ex-Post Supervisions” promulgated by the former Ministry of Culture. The aims of such laws 

include the regulation of the qualifications of operating entities of online games, the regulation of the operation of online games, 

the  protection  for  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  online  game  users  and  adolescents  and  the  privacy  protection  of  the 

personal data of users.

120

Tencent Holdings Limited

Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe have been actively implementing various measures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies. 

For instance, we have already obtained the relevant credentials for operating online games, such as the Telecommunication 

Business Operation Permit, the Online Publishing Service Licence and the Internet Culture Business Permit.

To safeguard the  physical and mental health of online game users and adolescents, we have implemented  the real  name 

system and anti-addiction system in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the PRC and strengthened the promotion 

of healthy gaming and anti-addiction through various channels. In February 2017, we launched a series of services on “Tencent 

Game  Guardian  Platform”  (http://jiazhang.qq.com)  which  assists  parents  to  monitor  the  gaming  habits  of  their  underage 

children. This is the platform dedicated to healthy gaming of underage children in the online game industry. In July 2017, we 

implemented the Healthy Gameplay System on Honour of Kings, which sends reminders to players or forces logout from the 

game if players spend too much time on the game in one day. In 2018, we have upgraded the Healthy Gameplay System, 

tightened the requirements for identity verification and made the system available for more games. We have also launched a 

customer service which sends reminders when a game player may have engaged in overspending and provides subsequent 

counselling.

In addition, we have worked with School of Brain and Cognitive Science of Beijing Normal University and Data Centre of the 

China  Internet  (DCCI)  to  publish “Guide  on  Healthy  Use  of  the  Internet  for  Teenagers”  and “Research  on  Online  Gaming 

Behaviours of and Online Protections for Teenagers”. Parents, education institutions and industry players can download these 

documents free of charge for their reference.

Monitoring of and Protection for Original User-generated Content

Each of Weixin/WeChat and QQ provides a mechanism for users to report any fake or inappropriate content circulated on its 

platform. To protect the original user-generated content, Weixin/WeChat has launched a new feature in December 2017 for the 

Weixin/WeChat official account holders to declare the originality of the content generated by them on Weixin/WeChat so as to 

help identify and deter copyright infringement more effectively.

Intellectual Property Rights

We are a technology-oriented company and we stress the importance of the observation and protection of intellectual property 

(“IP”) rights. We have established a dedicated IP team with approximately 80 employees as of 31 December 2018 that is 

responsible for the day-to-day management of legal matters involving trademark, patent, copyright, domain names and other 

IP rights.

121

Annual Report 2018Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe began a comprehensive programme for the management of IP at an  early stage. We have consistently applied for  the 

registration of IP rights since the early stages of its establishment. With the successful development of our business, we have 

expanded our global IP portfolio to cover more than 100 countries and regions. As of 31 December 2018, we had obtained 

over 19,000 officially registered trademarks and over 9,000 issued patents. Coupled with our creation of a vast amount of 

copyrighted  content,  we  have  accumulated  IP  assets  of  considerable  value.  Our  IP  team  has  developed  a  comprehensive 

database for our patents, trademarks and copyrights and our strong data analytical skills enable us to manage and monitor 

our IP rights in a meticulous and efficient manner. To combat infringement of IP rights, our IP team has also established a 

comprehensive and efficient monitoring and maintenance system, and has devised various civil, criminal and administrative 

enforcement measures to protect our IP rights. Please see further details on the Company Website (https://www.tencent.com/

legal/html/en-us/property.html).

We  actively  participate  in  public  affairs  and  strive  to  promote  the  awareness  of  IP  protection  in  the  Internet  industry.  As 

members of the China National Information Technology Standardisation Committee, the China Intellectual Property Society, 

the Patent Protection Association of China, the World Wide Web Consortium, the International Trademark Association and 

the China Trademark Association, we have participated in the consultations on legislative amendments to the PRC laws and 

regulations  relating  to  patents,  trademarks  and  anti-competition  and  have  made  recommendations  in  the  development  of 

industry standards.

Within  the  past  decade,  we  had  several  times  been  awarded  “China  Patent  Gold  Awards”  by  the  State  Intellectual 

Property  Office  of  the  PRC,  “China  Trademark  Gold  Awards”  jointly  by  World  Intellectual  Property  Organisation  and  the

financial statements

The  Group  has  recognised  revenue  from  sales  of  virtual 

products/items to the users in respect of value-added services 

rendered  on  the  Group’s  online  platforms.  The  relevant 

revenue is recognised over the lifespans of respective virtual 

products/items  which  was  determined  by  the  management, 

on  an  item  by  item  basis,  with  reference  to  the  expected 

users’ relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity 

of the relevant virtual products/items, depending on the terms 

of the virtual products/items.

During the year ended 31 December 2018, a majority of the

from online games and was predominately derived from the 

sales of virtual products/items.

judgment on key assumptions in determining the estimated 

lifespans of the virtual products/items that were based on the 

expected users’ relationship periods.

We  tested,  on  a  sample  basis,  key  controls  in  respect  of 

the  recognition  of  revenue  from  sales  of  virtual  products/

items,  including  management’s  review  and  approval  of 

(i)  determination  of  the  estimated  lifespans  of  new  virtual 

products/items prior to their launches; and (ii) changes in the 

estimated  lifespans  of  existing  virtual  products/items  based 

on periodic reassessment on any indications triggering such 

changes.  We  also  assessed  the  data  generated  from  the 

Group’s  information  system  supporting  the  management’s 

review,  including  tested  the  information  system  logic  for 

generation of reports, and checked, on a  sample basis, the

users’  relationship  periods  for  certain  virtual  products/

items.  These  judgment  included  (i)  the  determination  of 

key assumptions applied in the expected users’ relationship 

We  assessed,  on  a  sample  basis,  the  expected  users’ 

relationship  periods  adopted  by  management  by  testing 

the  data  integrity  of  historical  users’  consumption  patterns 

and  calculation  of  the  churn  rates.  We  also  evaluated  the 

periods,  including  but  not  limited  to  historical  users’ 

consideration  made  by  management  in  determining  the 

consumption patterns, churn rates and reactivity on marketing 

underlying  assumptions  for  expected  users’  relationship 

activities,  games  life-cycle,  and  the  Group’s  marketing 

periods with reference to historical operating and marketing

basis, the historical accuracy of the management’s estimation 

process by comparing the actual users’ relationship periods 

for the year against the original estimation for selected virtual

Impairment assessments of goodwill, investments in associates 

and joint ventures

Refer  to  Notes  2.13(a),  2.15,  4(b),  19,  20  and  21  to  the 

We  tested  management’s  assessment  including  periodic 

consolidated financial statements

As at 31 December 2018, the Group held significant amounts 

of  goodwill,  investments  in  associates  and  joint  ventures 

amounting to RMB32,605 million, RMB219,215 million and 

RMB8,575  million,  respectively.  Impairment  provision  of 

RMB784 million, RMB14,069 million and RMB2,328 million 

had  been  recognised  during  the  year  ended  31  December 

2018 against the carrying amounts, respectively.

We focused on this area due to the magnitude of the carrying 

amounts of these assets and the fact that significant judgment 

were  required  by  management  (i)  to  identify  whether  any 

impairment  indications  evaluation  as  to  whether  indicators 

of  impairment  exist  by  corroborating  with  management  and 

market information.

We also tested, on a sample basis, key controls in respect of 

the impairment assessments, including the determination of 

appropriate  impairment  approaches,  valuation  models  and 

assumptions  and  the  calculation  of  impairment  provisions, 

which we found no material exceptions.

Management adopted different valuation models, on a case 

by case basis, in carrying out  the impairment assessments, 

mainly including discounted cash flows and market approach. 

We  assessed,  on  a  sample  basis,  the  basis  management 

impairment indicators existed for any of these assets during

market approach, for the impairment assessments.

In respect of the impairment assessments of cash generating 

units  that  contain  goodwill,  investments  in  associates  and 

investments  in  joint  ventures  using  discounted  cash  flows, 

we assessed the key assumptions adopted including revenue 

growth  rates,  profit  margins,  discount  rates  and  other 

assumptions  by  examining  the  approved  financial/business 

forecast  models,  and  comparing  actual  results  for  the  year 

against  the  previous  period’s  forecasts  and  the  applicable 

industry/business  data  external  to  the  Group.  We  assessed 

certain  of  these  key  assumptions  with  the  involvement  of 

our  internal  valuation  experts.  We  considered  that  the  key 

assumptions  adopted  by  management  are  in  line  with  our 

expectation and evidence obtained.

In respect of the impairment assessments of cash generating 

units  that  contain  goodwill,  investments  in  associates  and 

investments  in  joint  ventures  using  market  approach,  we 

assessed  the  valuation  assumptions  including  the  selection 

of  comparable  companies,  recent  market  transactions,  and 

liquidity discount for lack of marketability, etc. We assessed 

these  key  assumptions  adopted  by  management  with  the 

involvement  of  our  internal  valuation  experts  based  on  our 

industry  knowledge  and  independent  research  performed 

by us. We considered that the key assumptions adopted by 

management  are  in  line  with  our  expectation  and  evidence

We independently tested, on a sample basis, the accuracy of 

mathematical calculation applied in the valuation models and 

the calculation of impairment charges. We did not identify any

financial statements

As  at  31  December  2018,  the  Group’s  financial  assets  and 

financial liabilities which were carried at fair value comprised 

financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  financial

in  relation  to  the  valuation  process  including  the  adoption 

of  applicable  valuation  methodology  and  the  application 

of  appropriate  assumptions  in  different  circumstances,  by

RMB43,519  million  and  RMB4,506  million,  respectively,  of 

which  approximately  RMB83,934  million  of  these  financial 

assets and approximately RMB4,466 million of these financial 

liabilities  were  measured  based  on  significant  unobservable 

inputs and classified as “Level 3 financial instruments”.

We focused on this area due to the high degree of judgment 

required in determining the respective fair values of Level 3 

financial instruments, which do not have direct open market 

quoted  values,  with  respect  to  the  adoption  of  applicable 

valuation  methodology  and  the  application  of  appropriate 

assumptions in the valuation.

We  involved  our  internal  valuation  experts  to  discuss  with 

management  and  assess  the  appropriateness  of  valuation 

methodology and assumptions used. We tested, on a sample 

basis,  valuation  of  Level  3  financial  instruments  as  at  31 

December  2018  by  evaluating  the  underlying  assumptions 

and  inputs  including  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility, 

relevant  underlying  financial  projections,  and  market 

information  of  recent  transactions  (such  as  recent  fund 

raising transactions undertaken by the investees) as well as 

underlying  supporting  documentation.  We  also  tested,  on 

a  sample  basis,  the  arithmetical  accuracy  of  the  valuation 

computation.  We  found  that  the  valuation  methodology 

of  Level  3  financial  instruments  is  acceptable  and  the 

assumptions  made  by  management  are  supported  by 

available evidence.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Independent Auditor’s ReportOTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

129

Annual Report 2018Independent Auditor’s Report As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

(cid:127) 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

(cid:127) 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

(cid:127) 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

(cid:127) 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

(cid:127) 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

(cid:127) 

Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

130

Tencent Holdings Limited

Independent Auditor’s ReportWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

Tencent Holdings Limited

Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsFor the year ended 31 December 2018 
 
 
 
1 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  value-added  services  (“VAS”)  and  online  advertising  services  to  users  in  the 

People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interests in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

(cid:127) 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

(cid:127) 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer; and

(cid:127) 

the right to control the management, financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

143

Annual Report 2018Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20181 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.3(a) and Note 46) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 46.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit 

or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, other financial liabilities and derivative 

financial instruments, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 

are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

144

Tencent Holdings Limited

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20182 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(a)  New and amended standards adopted by the Group

The following standards and amendments have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year beginning on 1 January 2018:

IFRS 9

IFRS 15

Financial instruments

Revenue from contracts with customers

IFRS 2 (amendment)

Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions

IAS 40 (amendment)

Transfers of investment property

IFRIC 22

Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration

The Group has changed its accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. Except IFRS 

9, the adoption of these new and amended standards does not have significant impact on the consolidated 

financial statements of the Group, details of which are disclosed in Note 2.2.

(b)  New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective

A number of new standards and interpretations have not come into effect for the financial year beginning 

1  January  2018,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of 

the Group, except IFRS 16 “Lease” as set out below:

Nature of change

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of 

financial position by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the 

new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. 

The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.

Impact

The Group has set up a project team which has reviewed all of the Group’s leasing arrangements effective as 

of the year of ended 31 December 2018 in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16. The standard 

will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases.

As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of RMB12,294 million, 

see Note 42. Of these commitments, approximately RMB189 million relate to short-term leases which will be 

recognised on a straight-line basis as expense in profit or loss.

145

Annual Report 2018Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20182 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective (Cont’d)

For the remaining lease commitments, based on management’s preliminary assessment, the Group expects 

to recognise right-of-use assets of approximately RMB10 billion and lease liabilities of approximately RMB10 

billion on 1 January 2019. The Group expects that net profit will not be materially changed as a result of 

adopting  the  new  rules.  It  will  result  in  reclassification  of  operating  cash  flows  and  financing  cash  flows 

relating to the payments of lease liabilities.

The  Group’s  activities  as  a  lessor  are  not  material  and  hence  the  Group  does  not  expect  any  significant 

impact on the consolidated financial statements. However, some additional disclosures will be required from 

the financial year beginning on 1 January 2019.

Date of adoption by Group

The Group will apply the standard from its mandatory adoption date of 1 January 2019. The Group intends 

to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first 

adoption. All right-of-use assets will be measured at the amount of the lease liabilities on adoption (adjusted 

for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses).

2.2  Changes in accounting policies

This  note  explains  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  IFRS  9 “Financial  Instruments”  and  IFRS  15  “Revenue  from 

Contracts with Customers” on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(a) 

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of 

financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets 

and hedge accounting.

The  Group’s  adoption  of  IFRS  9  from  1  January  2018  resulted  in  changes  in  accounting  policies  and 

adjustments  to  the  amounts  recognised  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  new  accounting 

policies are set out in Note 2.16 and 2.17 below. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, 

comparative figures have not been restated. As a result, any adjustments to carrying amounts of financial 

assets  or  financial  liabilities  were  recognised  at  the  beginning  of  the  current  year,  with  the  difference 

recognised in opening retained earnings.

Management has assessed the business model and the terms relating to the collection of contractual cash 

flows applicable to the financial assets held by the Group at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 

2018) and has classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories, which are those 

to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through profit or 

loss), and those to be measured at amortised cost. The main effects resulting from this reclassification are as

Certain equity investments and debt instruments previously classified as AFS at an aggregated amount of 

RMB68,703  million  were  reclassified  from  AFS  to  FVPL  on  1  January  2018,  and  accumulated  fair  value 

gains of RMB16,210 million were transferred from the AFS reserves to retained earnings on 1 January 2018.

Certain equity investments of RMB58,515 million were reclassified from AFS to FVOCI on 1 January 2018, 

because these investments are not held for trading and meet the definition of equity instruments from the 

perspective of the issuer. The Group elected to classify them as FVOCI. As a result, accumulated fair value 

gains of RMB14,942 million were transferred from the AFS reserves to FVOCI reserves on 1 January 2018.

Investments  in  RCPS  of  RMB22,976  million  with  embedded  derivatives  of  RMB3,818  million  previously 

recorded in OFA were considered in their entirety as a single instrument and were reclassified to FVPL as at 

1 January 2018. They do not meet the definition of equity instruments from the perspective of the issuer and 

they are not eligible to be classified as at amortised cost in accordance with IFRS 9, because their cash flows 

do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. There was no impact on the amounts previously 

recognised in profit or loss in relation to these assets from the adoption of IFRS 9.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Changes in accounting policies (Cont’d)

(a) 

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Cont’d)

Classification and measurement (Cont’d)

There was no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect 

the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss, while the Group 

did not have any such liabilities.

Derivative and hedging activities

In prior years, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts to hedge its exposure arising from 

its borrowings carried at floating rates, which were qualified as hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps in 

place as at 31 December 2017 qualified as cash flow hedges under IFRS 9 and have been thus treated as 

continuing hedges upon the adoption of the standard.

Impairment of financial assets

The Group has the following types of financial assets subject to the new expected credit loss model under 

IFRS 9:

(cid:127)  

(cid:127)  

Accounts receivable; and

Deposits and other receivables.

For accounts receivable, the Group applies the simplified approach for expected credit losses prescribed 

by IFRS 9. Based on the assessments performed by management, the changes in the loss allowance for 

accounts receivable were not significant.

Impairment on deposits and other receivables is  measured  as either 12-month  expected credit losses  or 

lifetime  expected  credit  loss,  depending  on  whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk 

since the initial recognition. Based on the assessments performed by management, the changes in the loss 

allowance for deposits and other receivables were insignificant.

(b) 

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The Group has adopted IFRS 15  from  1 January 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies 

and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 15 establishes a 

comprehensive framework for determining when to recognise revenue and how much revenue to recognise 

through  a  five-step  approach,  provides  specific  guidance  on  contract  costs  and  license  arrangements, 

and  also  includes  a  cohesive  set  of  disclosure  requirements  about  revenue  and  cash  flows  arising  from 

the  contracts  with  customers  of  which  details  are  disclosed  in  Note  5.  In  accordance  with  the  transition 

provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new rules retrospectively,  and since the impact is  not 

material to the consolidated financial statements of the Group, comparative figures have not been restated.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

2.3  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations (Cont’d)

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as 

equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or financial asset. In 

addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 46(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.4  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally 

but  not  necessarily  accompanying  a  shareholding  of  between  20%  and  50%  of  the  voting  rights.  Investments 

in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 

Group’s investments in associates include underlying goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated 

impairment loss.

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates  are recognised as  a reduction  in the 

carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests 

in the associate, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 

unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including investments in associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.5), are impaired. 

If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference  between  the  recoverable 

amount of the investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the 

consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.4  Associates (Cont’d)

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

2.5  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint venture (which includes any long-term receivables that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  venture),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interests  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.6 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The cost of associates/joint ventures acquired in stages, except for the change from an associate to a joint venture, 

is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interests  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any  additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interests is taken to the consolidated income statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised in prior periods in relation to  the previously held interests  is  also  taken  to  the  consolidated  income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.7  Disposal of associates

When the Group loses significant influence over an associate, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A 

gain or loss is recognised at any difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus any proceeds from 

disposing part of the interests in the associate and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity 

method of accounting was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income by an 

associate should be reclassified to the consolidated income statement or transferred to another category of equity 

as specified and permitted by applicable IFRSs when the Group loses significant influence over the associate.

2.8  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.9  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.9  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange 

rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried 

at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-

monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss 

are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation 

differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equity instruments classified as FVOCI, are included 

in other comprehensive income.

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at  average  exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 

taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.10 Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the reporting period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings

Computer equipment

Furniture and office equipment

Motor vehicles

20 ~ 50 years

2 ~ 5 years

2 ~ 5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease term

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction costs less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.15).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.11 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.12 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease.

2.13 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  represents  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred 

plus acquisition-date fair value of the equity interests previously held by the Group and the non-controlling 

interests in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately under “Other gains/(losses), net” and is not subsequently reversed.

(b) 

Licensed online contents

Licensed  online  contents  mainly  include  video  and  music  contents.  They  are  initially  recognised  and 

measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  as  acquired  through  business  combinations.  Licensed  online 

contents are amortised using a straight-line method or an accelerated method which reflects the estimated 

consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include game licences, copyrights, computer software and technology and 

non-compete  agreements.  They  are  initially  recognised  and  measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  of 

intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally one to ten years) using the 

straight-line method which reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic benefits are 

expected to be consumed.

2.14 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 46(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might 

be impaired. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 

carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 

costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 

which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill 

that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.16 Investments and other financial assets

(a)  Classification and measurement

From 1 January 2018, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

‧ 

those  to  be  measured  subsequently  at  fair  value  (either  through  other  comprehensive  income,  or 

through profit or loss), and

‧ 

those to be measured at amortised cost.

The  classification  depends  on  the  entity’s  business  model  for  managing  the  financial  assets  and  the 

contractual terms of the cash flows.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 

asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 

of  the  financial  asset.  Transaction  costs  of  financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are 

expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 

cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

Debt instruments

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group’s business model 

for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three categories 

into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

‧ 

Amortised cost: Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash 

flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are classified as and measured at amortised 

cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment measured at amortised cost which is not part of a hedging 

relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income 

from these financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the  recognition of impairment losses  or 

reversals,  interest  income  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or 

loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in “Other gains/

(losses),  net”  in  the  consolidated  income  statement.  Interest  income  from  these  financial  assets  is 

recognised using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented 

in “finance costs, net” and impairment losses or reversals for “Other gains/(losses), net”.

‧ 

FVPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are classified as and 

measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  debt  investment  measured  at  fair 

value through profit or loss which is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and 

presented in “Other gains/(losses), net” for the period in which it arises.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets 

changes.

Equity instruments

The Group initially recognises and subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Upon initial 

recognition,  the  Group’s  management  can  elect  to  classify  irrevocably  its  equity  investments  as  financial 

assets at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity instrument under IAS 32 and are not held for trading. 

The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Where  the  Group  has  made  an  irrevocable  election  to  present  fair  value  gains  and  losses  on  equity 

investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and 

losses  to  profit  or  loss  following  the  derecognition  of  the  investments.  Dividends  from  such  investments 

continue to be recognised in profit or loss as  “Other gains/(losses), net” when the Group’s right to receive 

payments is established. Equity instruments designated as FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

FVPL  include  financial  assets  designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and 

financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI. Changes in the fair value of FVPL 

are recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment

From 1 January 2018, the Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated 

with  its  debt  instruments  carried  at  amortised  cost  and  FVOCI.  The  impairment  methodology  applied 

depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, 

which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised since initial recognition.

Impairment on deposits and other receivables  is  measured  as either 12-month expected credit losses  or 

lifetime expected credit losses, depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 

since initial recognition. If a significant increase in credit risk of a deposit or receivable has occurred since 

initial recognition, the impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.

(c)  Accounting policies applied until 31 December 2017

The Group has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, but has elected not to restate comparative information. As a 

result, the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for in accordance with the Group’s 

previous accounting policy.

Classification

Until 31 December 2017, the Group classified its financial assets in the following categories: FVPL, loans 

and receivables and AFS. The classification depended on the purpose for which the financial assets were 

acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets are quoted in an active market. Management 

determined the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

(i) 

FVPL

FVPL are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 

principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives  are classified  as held for trading 

unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this  category  are  classified  as  current  assets  if 

expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.

Classification (Cont’d)

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated statement of 

financial position.

(iii)  AFS

Investments  are  designated  as  AFS  if  they  do  not  have  fixed  maturities  and  fixed  or  determinable 

payments, and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-term. Financial assets that 

are not classified into any of the other categories are also included in the available-for-sale category. 

They  are  included  in  non-current  assets  unless  management  intends  to  dispose  of  the  investment 

within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Subsequent measurement

The measurement at initial recognition did not change on adoption of IFRS 9, see description above.

Subsequent  to  the  initial  recognition,  AFS  and  FVPL  are  subsequently  carried  at  fair  value.  Loans  and 

receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Changes in the fair value of AFS are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired 

or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 

When AFS are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive 

income are included in the consolidated income statement as “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Interest  on  loans  and  receivables  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement  as  part  of  interest  income.  Dividends  on  AFS  equity  instruments  are 

recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Impairment

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is 

objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 

of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows 

of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

(cid:127) 

Assets carried at amortised cost

Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtor or a group of debtors is experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability 

that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate 

that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or 

economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables category, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding 

future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 

interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is 

recognised in the consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount 

rate  for  measuring  any  impairment  loss  is  the  current  effective  interest  rate  determined  under  the 

contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s 

fair value using an observable market price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of  the impairment loss decreases and  the  decrease  can  be 

related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement 

in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in 

the consolidated income statement.

Impairment (Cont’d)

(cid:127) 

Assets classified as AFS

For equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost 

is also considered as an indication that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence of impairment 

exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current 

fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the consolidated 

income  statement  -  is  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement. 

Impairment  losses  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  on  equity  instruments  are  not 

reversed through the consolidated income statement.

For  debt  securities,  if  any  such  evidence  exists,  the  cumulative  loss  -  measured  as  the  difference 

between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and the current fair 

value,  less  any  impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  the  consolidated 

income statement - is reclassified from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement. If, 

in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and 

the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised 

in  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed  through  the  consolidated 

income statement.

Hybrid financial instruments

Hybrid financial instruments held by the Group comprise instruments with redemption features of associates 

that can be converted to ordinary shares at the option of the holder.

The Group either (i) accounts for different components of the hybrid financial instruments separately or (ii) 

designates the entire financial instruments as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 

The host component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the hybrid financial 

instrument as a whole and the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The subsequent measurement of the 

host component and embedded derivatives follow the respective accounting policy of financial instruments 

as stated in Notes 2.16(c) above and 2.17.

2.17 Derivative and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive 

and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The  method of  recognising  the  resulting  gain or loss 

depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being 

hedged.

The  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  as  hedges  of  a  particular  risk  associated  with  the  cash  flows  of  a 

recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges). The Group documents 

at the inception of the hedging relationship the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 

items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The 

Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the 

inception of each hedge relationship.

A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the hedge effectiveness requirements under 

IFRS 9. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 

flow  hedges  is  recognised  through  other  comprehensive  income  within  equity,  while  any  ineffective  portion  is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss, within “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in the 

cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item 

(‘aligned time value’) are recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within 

equity.

Amounts accumulated in equity are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, 

as follows:

‧  Where  the  hedged  item  subsequently  results  in  the  recognition  of  a  non-financial  asset,  the  amounts 

accumulated  in  equity  are  removed  from  other  reserves  and  included  within  the  initial  cost  of  the  asset. 

These deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss.

‧ 

For  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  effective  portion  of  the  derivatives  is 

reclassified to profit or loss at the same time when the hedged cash flows affects profit or loss.

When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 

hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remain 

in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 

cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging included in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or 

loss.

2.18 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and  there  is  an intention  to 

settle on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 

must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in certain 

circumstances, such as default, insolvency, bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

2.19 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily  accounted for  using  the  weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.20 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.21 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, money market funds and other 

short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

The  Group  does  not  recognise  cash  amounts  deposited  with  banks  (which  are  received  under  its  payment 

business) under users’ entrustment in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group holds these 

cash amounts as a custodian according to the relevant users’ agreements.

2.22 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  Group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  instruments,  the  consideration  paid,  including 

any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 

as  treasury  shares  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued, 

any  consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.23 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair  value and subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the 

effective interest method.

2.24 Put option arrangements

Put options are financial instruments granted by the Group which permit the holders to put back to the Group their 

shares in certain subsidiaries for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are met. If the Group does 

not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or other financial assets under the put option, a financial 

liability is initially recognised at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows on exercise under the put 

option. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying amount of 

the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying 

amount based on the present value of revised estimated future cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original 

effective  interest  rate  and  the  adjustment  will  be  recognised  as  “Other  gains/(losses),  net”  in  the  consolidated 

income  statement.  In  the  event  that  the  put  option  expires  unexercised,  the  liability  is  derecognised  with  a 

corresponding adjustment to equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option first becomes exercisable 12 months after the 

end of the reporting period.

2.25 Financial guarantee contracts

The Group has a financial guarantee contract that represents guarantee provided by the Group in respect of a put 

arrangement granted by an investee to the employees of its subsidiary.

The  financial  guarantee  contracts  are  initially  recognised  as  a  financial  liability  at  fair  value  on  the  date  the 

guarantee is given. The liability is subsequently measured at the higher of:

‧ 

‧ 

the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9 and

the  amount  initially  recognised  less,  where  appropriate,  the  cumulative  amount  of  income  recognised  in 

accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

167

Annual Report 2018Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20182 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.25 Financial guarantee contracts (Cont’d)

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows 

between the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required 

without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of the investees are provided for no compensation, the fair 

value is accounted for as contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

2.26 Borrowings, notes payable and borrowing costs

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their terms using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan facilities to the 

extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 

draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 

down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the term of the facility to 

which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction  of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 

added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 

sale. During the year ended 31 December 2018, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.27 Current and deferred income tax

The income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax, which is recognised in the consolidated 

income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 

in equity. In this case, the income tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  However, 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 

a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable 

profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 

substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax 

asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to 

utilise those temporary differences and tax losses.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the 

Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally, the 

Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only when there is an agreement 

in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, 

deferred tax liability in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from the associate’s undistributed profit is 

not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied 

by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 

settle the balances on a net basis.

2.28 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate fund. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior years. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants  as  consideration  for  equity  instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of 

the Group. The fair value of the employee services and other qualifying participants’ services received in 

exchange  for  the  grant  of  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  is  recognised  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting 

period, i.e. the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied, and credited to 

equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 

the  options  granted  by  using  option-pricing  model, “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the “Binomial 

Model”), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) 

but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award 

shares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s 

shares at the grant date. The Group also adopts valuation techniques to assess the fair value of other equity 

instruments of the Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

2.28 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From the perspective of the Company, the grants of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries are 

made in exchange for their services related to the subsidiaries. Accordingly, the share-based compensation 

expenses are treated as part of the  “Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial 

position.

At each reporting period end, the Group revises the estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 

consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

If  the  Group  repurchases  vested  equity  instruments,  the  payments  made  to  the  employees  and  other 

qualifying  participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the 

payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. 

Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense  is recognised  for  any  modification that increases  the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

2.29 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.29 Provisions (Cont’d)

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.30 Revenue recognition

The Group generates revenues primarily from provision of VAS, online advertising services and other online related 

services in the PRC. Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer. 

Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the goods and services 

may be transferred over time or at a point in time.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  primarily  include  revenues  from  the  provision  of  online  games  and  social  networks 

services. Online games revenues are mainly derived from sales of in-game virtual items, and social networks 

revenues are mainly derived from sales of virtual products such as VAS subscriptions across various online 

platforms, and games revenues attributable to social networks business. The Group offers virtual products/

items to users on the Group’s online platforms. The VAS fees are paid directly by end users mainly via online 

payment channels.

Revenue from VAS is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services. 

Giving there is an explicit or implicit obligation of the Group to maintain the virtual products/items operated 

on the Group’s platforms and allow users to gain access to them, revenue is recognised over the estimated 

lifespans of the respective virtual products/items. The estimated lifespans of different virtual products/items 

are determined by the management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated 

period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items depending on the respective term of virtual products/

items.

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to 

each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the 

prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.30 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

In respect of the Group’s VAS services directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various 

third  parties  platforms,  these  third  party  platforms  collect  the  relevant  service  fees  (the  “Online  Service 

Fees”) on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of platform provider fees 

(as part of “Channel and distribution costs”). Such Channel and distribution costs are withheld and deducted 

from  the  gross  Online  Service  Fees  collected  by  these  platforms  from  the  users,  with  the  net  amounts 

remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Online Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis, given it 

acts as the principal in these transactions based on the assessment according to the criteria stated in (d) 

below, and recognises such Channel and distribution costs as cost of revenues.

The  Group  also  opens  its  online  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  under  certain  co-

operation  agreements,  of  which  the  Group  pays  to  the  third-party  game/application  developers  a  pre-

determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from the users of the Group’s online platforms for 

the  virtual  products/items  purchased.  The  Group  recognises  the  related  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis 

depending on whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction.

The Group adopts different revenue recognition methods based on its specific responsibilities/obligations in 

different VAS offerings.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from media advertisements and from social 

and others advertisements, depending on the placement of advertising properties and inventories.

Advertising contracts are signed to establish the prices and advertising services to be provided based on 

different arrangements, including display-based advertising that are display of ads for an agreed period of 

time, and performance-based advertising.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.30 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(b)  Online advertising (Cont’d)

Revenue from display-based advertising are recognised on number of display/impression basis or ratably 

over  the  respective  contractual  term  with  the  advertisers  or  their  advertising  agencies  depending  on  the 

contractual measures. Revenue from performance-based advertising are recognised when relevant specific 

performance measures are fulfilled. Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group 

allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, 

which is determined based on the prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

(c)  Other revenues

The  Group’s  other  revenues  are  primarily  derived  from  provision  of  FinTech  services,  cloud  services, 

television series and film production services and other businesses. The Group recognises other revenues 

when the respective services are rendered, or when the control of the products are transferred to customers.

(d)  Principal agent consideration

The Group reports revenue on a gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as a principal 

or an agent in a transaction. The Group is a principal if it controls the specified product or service before 

that product or service is transferred to a customer or it has a right to direct others to provide the product or 

service to the customer on the Group’s behalf. Indicators that the Group is a principal include but not limited 

to whether the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in establishing the selling 

price; (iii) has discretion in supplier selection; (iv) changes the product or performs part of the service, and (v) 

has involvement in the determination of product or service specifications.

2.30 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(e)  Contract liabilities and contract costs

A contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group 

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. The Group’s contract 

liabilities mainly comprise of unamortised pre-paid tokens or cards, virtual items, Internet traffic and other 

support to be offered to certain investee companies in the future periods measured at their fair value on the 

inception dates (Note 5(c)), and customer loyalty incentives offered to the customers.

Contract  costs  include  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  costs  to  fulfil  a  contract  with  the 

customers.  The  contract  costs  are  amortised  using  a  method  which  is  consistent  with  the  pattern  of 

recognition of the respective revenues.

(f) 

Practical expedients and exemptions

The transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, 

has not been disclosed, as substantially all of the Group’s contracts have a duration of one year or less. The 

unsatisfied performance obligation related to cooperation arrangements with  certain investees have  been 

included in deferred revenue.

2.31 Interest income

Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial 

asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 

the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss 

allowance). Interest income is presented as “Interest income” where it is mainly earned from financial assets that 

are held for cash management purposes.

Accounting policies applied until 31 December 2017

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.32 Dividend income

Dividends are received from FVPL and FVOCI (2017: from AFS). Dividends are recognised in “Other gains/(losses), 

net” in the consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established. This applies even if 

they are paid out of pre-acquisition profits, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of 

an investment. In this case, the dividend is recognised in other comprehensive income if it relates to an investment 

measured at FVOCI. However, the investment may need to be tested for impairment as a consequence.

2.33 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

and expenses which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.34 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.35 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate.

2.36 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency exposures, primarily with respect to Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”), USD and Euro (“EUR”). 

Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  when  future  commercial  transactions  or  recognised  assets  and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

subsidiaries. The functional currency of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures by using foreign currency forwards.

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group entered into foreign currency forward contracts 

in  relation  to  projected  purchases  that  qualify  as  “high  probable”  forecast  transactions  and  hence 

satisfy  the  requirements  for  hedge  accounting.  Under  the  Group’s  policy  the  critical  terms  of  the 

forwards must align with the hedged items.

The Group only designates the spot component of foreign currency forwards in hedge relationships. 

The  spot  component  is  determined  with  reference  to  relevant  spot  market  exchange  rates.  The 

differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as the 

forward points. It is discounted, where material.

The  changes  in  the  forward  element  of  the  foreign  currency  forwards  that  relate  to  hedged  items 

are  deferred  in  the  costs  of  hedging  reserve.  The  effects  of  the  foreign  currency  related  hedging 

instruments are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  the  Group  reported  exchange  gains  of  approximately 

RMB229  million  (2017:  RMB152  million)  within “Finance  costs,  net”  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement.

As at 31 December 2018, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange 

rates  of  the  above  currencies  against  the  two  major  functional  currencies  would  not  result  in  a 

significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities 

denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency are considered 

to be not significant, given the exchange rate peg between HKD and USD. Accordingly, no sensitivity 

analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(ii)  Price risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  mainly  arising  from  investments  held  by  the  Group  that 

are  classified  either  as  FVPL  (Note  23)  or  FVOCI  (Note  24).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from 

the investments, the Group diversifies its investment portfolio. The investments are  made  either for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity analysis is performed by management to assess the exposure of the Group’s financial results 

to equity price risk of FVPL and FVOCI (2017: AFS) at the end of each reporting period. If prices of the 

respective instruments held by the Group had been 5% (31 December 2017: 5%) higher/lower as at 

31 December 2018, profit for the year would have been approximately RMB4,794 million higher/lower 

as a result of gains/losses on financial instruments classified as at FVPL, other comprehensive income 

would have been approximately RMB2,147 million higher/lower as a result of gains/losses on financial 

instruments classified as at FVOCI (2017: RMB4,069 million).

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 25, 28 and 30.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 34 and 35, representing a substantial portion 

of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group to cash 

flow interest-rate risk whereas those carried at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate 

risk.

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (Cont’d)

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts 

to hedge its exposure arising from borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate swap 

contracts, the Group agreed with the counterparties to exchange, at specified interval, the difference 

between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed 

notional amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings 

from  floating  rates  to  fixed  rates  and  were  qualified  for  hedge  accounting.  Details  of  the  Group’s 

outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2018 have been disclosed in Note 26.

The effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s financial position and performance are as follows:

interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to 

cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after 

considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is 

presented for interest rate risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, accounts receivable, other receivables, as well as short-term investments measured at amortised 

cost  and  at  FVPL.  The  carrying  amount  of  each  class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the  Group’s 

maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

(i) 

Credit risk of cash and deposits and short-term investments

To  manage  this  risk,  the  Group  only  makes  transactions  with  state-owned  banks  and  financial 

institutions in the PRC and reputable international banks and financial institutions outside of the PRC. 

There has been no recent history of default in relation to these banks and financial institutions. The 

expected credit loss is close to zero.

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable

To manage this risk, the Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues of credit terms are made 

to  counterparties  with  an  appropriate  credit  history  and  the  management  performs  ongoing  credit 

evaluations of its counterparties. In addition, the Group has a large number of customers and there is 

no concentration of credit risk.

The  Group’s  online  advertising  that  are  sales  to/through  advertising  agencies  or  directly  to  the 

advertisers are at term of full advances, partial advances or sales on credit according to the Group’s 

credit policies. The credit period granted to the customers is usually not more than 90 days and the 

credit quality of these customers are assessed, which takes into account their financial position, past 

experience and other factors.

The Group’s revenues from VAS are generally paid by end users mainly via online payment channels, 

whereas the revenues from VAS delivered to its end users through third party platforms are collected 

by  these  third  party  platform  providers  and  remitted  to  the  Group  under  a  credit  period  within  60 

days. In addition, the Group also sells prepaid credits through various channels such as sales agents, 

telecommunication operators, third party platform providers and Internet cafes, etc. Apart from certain 

credit  periods  granted  to  the  telecommunication  operators  and  third  party  platform  providers,  full 

advances are required from other channels.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk (Cont’d)

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable (Cont’d)

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 

9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all accounts receivable. In view of 

the sound financial position and collection history of receivables due from these counterparties and 

insignificant  risk  of  default,  to  measure  the  expected  credit  losses,  accounts  receivable  have  been 

grouped  based  on  shared  credit  risk  characteristics  and  the  days  past  due.  A  default  on  accounts 

receivable is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 90 days of when they 

fall due. Accounts receivable are written off, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical 

recovery  efforts  and  has  concluded  that  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  of  recovery.  Indicators 

that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the  failure  of a debtor 

to engage in a repayment plan within the Group, and its failure to make contractual payments for a 

period of greater than 3 years past due. Impairment losses on accounts receivables are presented as 

net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 

are credited against the same item. Management believes that the expected credit loss is immaterial 

and the credit risk inherent in the Group’s outstanding accounts receivable balances due from these 

counterparties is not significant.

(iii)  Credit risk of other receivables

Other  receivables  at  the  end  of  each  of  the  years  are  mainly  comprised  of  loans  to  investees  and 

investees’ shareholders, rental deposits and other receivables. The Group considers the probability of 

default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been significant increase in credit risk 

on an ongoing basis throughout each of the years. To assess whether there is a significant increase in 

credit risk, the Group compares risk of default occurring on the assets as at the reporting date with the 

risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Especially the following indicators are incorporated:

–  

actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that 

are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations;

–  

actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the debtor;

–  

significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the debtor, including changes 

in the payment status of the debtor.

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk (Cont’d)

(iii)  Credit risk of other receivables (Cont’d)

Management considers the credit risk of other receivables is insignificant when they have a low risk of 

default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near 

term, and the loss allowance recognised is therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. In view 

of insignificant risk of default and credit risk since initial recognition, management believes that the 

expected credit loss under the 12 months expected losses method is immaterial.

Previous accounting policy for impairment of accounts receivable and other receivables is described in note 

2.16(c).

(c) 

Liquidity risk

The  Group  aims  to  maintain  sufficient  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities.  Due  to  the 

dynamic  nature  of  the  underlying  businesses,  the  Group  maintains  flexibility  in  funding  by  maintaining 

adequate cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital  refers  to  equity  and  external  debts  (including  borrowings  and  notes  payable).  In  order  to  maintain  or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The  Group  monitors  capital  by  regularly  reviewing  debts  to  adjusted  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation 

and amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflects 

financial health and liquidity position. The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts 

by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

The  fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined  with  reference  to  quoted  market 

prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly 

available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices 

represent  actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.  These  instruments  are 

included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include:

(cid:127) 

(cid:127) 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

(cid:127) 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2018, there was no transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value 

measurements.  For  transfers  in  and  out  of  level  3  measurements  see  the  following  table,  which  presents  the

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

Valuation processes inputs and relationships to fair value (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who performs valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting 

purposes.  The  team  performs  valuation,  or  necessary  updates,  at  least  once  every  quarter,  which  coincides 

with the Group’s quarterly reporting dates. On an annual basis, the team adopts various valuation techniques to 

determine the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and 

consulted when it is necessary.

The components of the level 3 instruments mainly include investments in unlisted companies classified as FVPL 

or  FVOCI,  and  other  financial  liabilities.  Other  financial  liabilities  mainly  include:  (i)  contingent  consideration 

payable related to business combination of the Group; and (ii) guarantee provided by the Group on certain put 

arrangements of an associate and put options issued by the Group to certain investors of the associate, at a pre-

determined pricing formula. As these investments and instruments are not traded in an active market, majority of 

their fair values have been determined using applicable valuation techniques including comparable transactions 

approach  and  other  option  pricing  approach.  These  valuation  approaches  require  significant  judgment, 

assumptions and inputs, including risk-free rates, expected volatility, relevant underlying financial projections, and 

market information of recent transactions (such as recent fund raising transactions undertaken by the investees) 

and other exposure, etc.

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 

3 fair value measurements.

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

For  the  fair  value  of  the  Group’s  investments  in  unlisted  companies,  the  sensitivity  analysis  is  performed  by 

management, see Note 3.1 (a) (ii) for details.

For the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combination, if growth rate of net profit had been 

5% higher or lower as at 31 December 2018, the fair value would have increased approximately RMB150 million 

or  decreased  approximately  RMB171  million.  If  the  expected  volatility  had  been  5%  higher  or  lower  as  at  31 

December 2018, the fair value would have decreased approximately RMB90 million or increased approximately 

RMB92 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual products/items provided on the Group’s online platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.30(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  on  the  Group’s 

online platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the estimated lifespans of the virtual products/

items. The estimated lifespans of different virtual products/items are determined by the management based on 

either the expected users’ relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/

items depending on the respective terms of virtual products/items.

Significant  judgments  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  including  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespans 

of  virtual  products/items  on  a  regular  basis  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of  change  in  the  expected  users’ 

relationship periods.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespans of the virtual products/items. The results may differ from 

the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different 

basis from that in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed for impairment 

whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  The 

recoverable  amounts  have  been  determined  based  on  value-in-use  calculations  or  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell. 

These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgment is required to identify any impairment indicators  existing for  any  of the Group’s  goodwill, other non-

financial assets to determine appropriate impairment approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value 

in use, for impairment review purposes, and to select key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, 

including  discounted  cash  flows  and  market  approach.  Changing  the  assumptions  selected  by  management 

in assessing impairment could materially affect the result of the impairment test and in turn affect the Group’s 

financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  If  there  is  a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  key  assumptions 

applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment charge to the consolidated income statement.

(c)  Fair value measurement of FVPL, FVOCI and other financial liabilities

The fair value assessment of FVPL, FVOCI and other  financial liabilities that are  measured  at level  3 fair  value 

hierarchy  requires  significant  estimates,  which  include  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility,  relevant  underlying 

financial  projections,  market  information  of  recent  transactions  (such  as  recent  fund  raising  transactions 

undertaken  by  the  investees)  and  other  assumptions.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could 

materially affect the respective fair value of these investments.

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.28(c),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants.  The  directors  have  adopted  the  Binomial  Model  to  determine  the  total  fair  value  of  the  options 

granted, which is to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant judgment on parameters, such 

as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the 

Binomial Model (Note 33).

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Binomial Model was approximately HKD3,533 million (equivalent to approximately  RMB2,868 million) in  2018 

(2017: HKD2,691 million (equivalent to approximately RMB2,373 million)).

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements (Cont’d)

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2018, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

88%-97% (31 December 2017: 88%-97%).

(e) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the 

worldwide provision for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax in the period 

in which such determination is made.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUES

(a)  Description of segments and principal activities

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s 

internal reporting in order to assess performance, allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based 

on these reports.

The Group has following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017:

–  

VAS;

–  

Online advertising; and

–  

Others.

“Others”  segment  primarily  comprises  FinTech  services,  cloud  services,  television  series  and  film  production 

services and other services.

The chief operating decision-makers assess the performance of the operating segments mainly based on segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore, they 

are  not  included  in  the  measure  of  the  segments’  performance  which  is  used  by  the  chief  operating  decision-

makers  as  a  basis  for  the  purpose  of  resource  allocation  and  assessment  of  segment  performance.  Interest 

income, other gains/(losses), net, finance income/(costs), net, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures 

and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

(iii)  PRC corporate income tax

PRC corporate income tax has been provided for at the applicable tax rates under the relevant regulations 

of  the  PRC  after  considering  the  available  preferential  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and  allowances,  and  on 

the estimated assessable profit of entities within the Group established in the PRC for the years ended 31 

December 2018 and 2017. The general PRC corporate income tax rate is 25% in 2018 and 2017.

Certain subsidiaries of the Group in the PRC were approved as High and New Technology Enterprise, and 

accordingly, they were subject to a preferential corporate income tax rate of 15% for the years ended 31 

December  2018  and  2017.  Moreover,  according  to  the  announcement  and  circular  issued  by  relevant 

government authorities, for the year of 2015 and beyond, a software enterprise that qualifies as a national 

key software enterprise is subject to a preferential corporate income tax rate of 10%.

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Company are entitled to other tax concessions and they are exempt from corporate income tax for two years, 

followed by a 50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the next three years, commencing from the first 

year of profitable operation, after offsetting tax losses generated in prior years.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other countries

Income  tax  on  profit  arising  from  other  jurisdictions,  including  the  United  States,  Europe,  East  Asia  and 

South America, has been calculated on the estimated assessable profit for the year at the respective rates 

prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions, ranging from 12.5% to 35%.

(v)  Withholding tax

According to applicable tax regulations prevailing in the PRC, dividends distributed by a company established 

in the PRC to a foreign investor with  respect to profit  derived after 1 January 2008  are generally subject 

to  a  10%  withholding  tax.  If  a  foreign  investor  is  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong,  under  the  double  taxation 

arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong, the relevant withholding tax rate applicable to the 

Group will be reduced from 10% to 5% subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.

Dividends  distributed  from  certain  jurisdictions  that  the  Group’s  entities  operate  in  are  also  subject  to 

withholding tax at respective applicable tax rates.

by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. During the years ended 31 December 2018 and 

2017, these share options and restricted shares had either anti-dilutive effect or insignificant dilutive effect to the 

Group’s diluted EPS.

13  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES (Cont’d)

Note:

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 are listed 

below:

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  amortisation  of  RMB24,698  million  (2017:  RMB17,837  million)  and 

RMB918 million (2017: RMB785 million) were charged to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses, 

respectively.

During the year ended 31 December 2018, impairment losses of RMB1,181 million (2017: RMB239 million) on goodwill 

and  other  intangible  assets  were  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement  under “Other  gains/(losses),  net”, 

resulting from revisions of financial/business outlook and changes in the market environment of the underlying business.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill was allocated to VAS segment with RMB25,672 million (31 December 2017: RMB23,608 million) and Others 

segment with RMB6,933 million (31 December 2017: Nil). The Group carries out its impairment testing on goodwill by 

comparing the recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of CGUs to their carrying amounts. For the purpose of goodwill 

impairment review, the recoverable amount of a CGU (group of CGUs) is the higher of its value in use and fair value less 

costs of disposal.

The key assumptions used for the calculation of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs under impairment testing were as 

follows:

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s online music business, online literature business and television series and film 

production business, value in use was determined using discounted cash flows calculations which derived from the five-

year financial projections plus a terminal value related to cash flows beyond the projection period extrapolated using an 

estimated terminal growth rate of not more than 5% (2017: not more than 5%). Management leveraged their experiences 

in the industries and provided forecast based on past performance and their anticipation of future business and market 

developments. Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 15% to 25% (2017: 20% to 25%) were applied in the discounted 

cash  flows  calculations,  which  reflected  assessments  of  time  value  and  the  specific  risks  relating  to  the  respective 

industries.

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s online game business, fair value less costs of disposal was determined based on 

ratios of EV (enterprise value) divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of several 

comparable public companies (ranging with 11-21x) (2017: ranging with 16-23x) multiplied by the EBITDA of the related 

CGU (group of CGUs) and discounted for the lack of marketability at a range of 10% to 20% (2017: 10% to 20%). The 

comparable public companies were chosen based on factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and 

financial risks.

When  determining  the  recoverable  amounts,  management  has  not  identified  reasonably  possible  change  in  key 

assumptions that could cause the CGU’s (group of CGUs’) carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group’s additions to investments in associates mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

an additional investment in an eCommerce company in the PRC of approximately RMB7,456 million. As at 31 December 

2018, the Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 17% on an outstanding basis;

(ii) 

an additional investment in a media and entertainment company in the PRC of approximately RMB4,800 million which 

was previously recognised as FVPL. Subsequently, such investment of approximately RMB3,461 million was transferred to 

investment in a subsidiary through an acquisition made by a non-wholly owned subsidiary (Note 40(a));

(iii) 

an additional investment in a media and entertainment company in the PRC of approximately RMB3,998 million. As at 31 

December 2018, the Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 43% on an outstanding basis;

(iv) 

an  new  investment  in  an  online  game  company  in  the  PRC  of  approximately  RMB2,985  million  to  subscribe  for 

approximately 12% of its equity interests on an outstanding basis;

(v) 

subscription  of  certain  additional  shares  of  a  leading  eCommerce  platform  for  services  in  the  PRC  upon  its  IPO  of 

approximately  RMB2,757  million.  Immediately  before  its  IPO,  the  Group’s  investment  in  this  investee  company  of 

approximately RMB48,173 million was classified as FVPL (Note 20(b)), and subsequently transferred to investment in an 

associate due to the conversion of preferred shares held by the Group to ordinary shares with board representation upon 

its IPO. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 19% on an 

outstanding basis;

(vi) 

an investment in an investment bank in the PRC of approximately RMB2,316 million to subscribe for approximately 5% of 

its equity interests on an outstanding basis; and

(vii)  new  investments  in  other  associates  and  additional  investments  in  existing  associates,  with  an  aggregate  amount  of 

approximately RMB16,606 million. These associates are principally engaged in online games, smart retails, technology 

and other Internet-related business.

Note: (Cont’d)

(b) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, transfers comprised of associates achieved in stages of an aggregate amount of 

approximately RMB75,931 million, and associates transferred to financial instruments or subsidiaries of an aggregate amount 

of approximately RMB4,338 million. In addition to the transfer described in Note 20(a) (v) and Note 23(a) (iii), the transfers in 

relation to associates achieved in stages mainly include:

(i) 

an acquisition of approximately 4% in a commercial property company in the PRC at a consideration of approximately 

RMB10,266 million was carried out in certain tranches and completed in September 2018. The board representation was 

effective upon the completion of final tranche and the investment was transferred from FVPL accordingly;

(ii) 

an investment in an Indian eCommerce company of approximately RMB5,386 million was transferred from FVPL, due to 

certain contractual rights attached to this investment having been changed;

(iii) 

the Group transferred several investments from FVPL to investments in associates at an aggregate amount of approximately 

RMB5,426 million upon the conversion of the redeemable instruments or preferred shares into ordinary shares upon their 

IPOs, mainly comprising investee companies that are principally engaged in automotive industry; and

(iv) 

the Group also transferred several other investments from FVPL to investments in associates at an aggregate amount of 

approximately RMB2,009 million as a result of obtaining board representation.

(c) 

Both external and internal sources of information of associates are considered in assessing whether there is any indication that 

the investment may be impaired, including but not limited to financial position, business performance and market capitalisation. 

The Group carries out impairment assessment on those investments with impairment indications, and the respective recoverable 

amounts of investments are determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

In  respect  of  the  recoverable  amount  using  value  in  use,  the  discounted  cash  flows  calculations  were  based  on  cash  flow 

projections estimated by management and the key assumptions adopted in these cash flow projections include revenue growth 

rate, profit margins and discount rate. The pre-tax discount rates adopted range from 15% to 20%. In respect of the recoverable 

amount based on fair value less costs of disposal, except for those listed associates using their respective market prices, the 

fair value less costs of disposal was calculated using certain key valuation assumptions including the selection of comparable 

companies, recent market transactions and liquidity discount for lack of marketability.

As a result, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB14,069 million (2017: RMB1,277 million) against the 

carrying amounts of certain investments in associates during the year ended 31 December 2018, which includes impairment loss 

of approximately RMB15,684 million recognised and approximately RMB1,615 million reversed. The impairment losses mainly 

resulted from revisions of financial/business outlook of the associates and changes in the market environment of the underlying 

business.

(d) 

The associates of the Group have been accounted for by using equity method based on the financial information of the associates 

prepared under the accounting policies generally consistent with the Group.

representation or other arrangements made, and it has no control or joint control over such investees as the Group has 

no  power  to  direct  relevant  activities  due  to  other  arrangements  made.  Consequently,  these  investments  have  been 

classified as associates.

(a) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group’s additions to FVPL mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

an investment in a commercial property company in the PRC which was carried out in certain tranches and completed in 

September 2018 as detailed in Note 20(b) (i);

(ii) 

an additional investment in a real estate O2O platform of approximately RMB3,478 million. As at 31 December 2018, the 

Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 7% on an outstanding basis;

(iii) 

an investment in a media and entertainment company of approximately RMB2,922 million to subscribe for approximately 

35% of its equity interests in form of preferred shares, on an outstanding basis. Immediately before its IPO, the Group’s 

investment  in  this  investee  company  of  approximately  RMB4,671  million  was  classified  as  FVPL  and  subsequently 

transferred to investment in an associate due to the conversion of preferred shares held by the Group to ordinary shares 

upon its IPO. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 32% on 

an outstanding basis;

(iv) 

additional  equity  interests  obtained  in  a  disposal  of  the  equity  interests  in  an  investee  company,  to  another  investee 

company of the Group at a total consideration of approximately USD551 million (equivalent to approximately RMB3,481 

million) comprised of cash and its equity interests. The acquirer is principally engaged in the provision of Internet-related 

services,  and  the  investment  in  this  acquirer  was  reclassified  to  investment  in  an  associate  due  to  the  conversion  of 

preferred shares held by the Group to ordinary shares with board representation upon its IPO as described in Note 20(a) (v) 

above;

(v) 

an  additional  investment  in  an  Asian  online  game  company  of  approximately  RMB2,799  million.  Subsequent  to  the 

additional investment, the Group obtained the board representation and the investment was transferred to investment in 

an associate accordingly;

(vi) 

an additional investment in a media and entertainment company of approximately RMB2,536 million. As at 31 December 

2018, the Group’s equity interests in this investee company are approximately 14% on an outstanding basis; and

(vii)  new investments and additional investments with an aggregate amounts of approximately RMB36,263 million in listed and 

unlisted entities mainly operated in the United States, the PRC and other Asian countries. These companies are principally 

engaged in online games, entertainment, technology and other Internet-related business.

(b) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, in addition to the transfers of FVPL to investments in associates with an aggregate 

amount of approximately RMB75,931 million described in Note 20(b) above, the transfers mainly include:

(i) 

the Group designated certain investments with an aggregate amount of approximately RMB3,577 million as FVOCI upon 

their  IPOs,  and  these  investments  were  previously  recorded  as  FVPL  due  to  the  form  of  redeemable  instruments  or 

preferred shares; and

(ii) 

the  Group  also  transferred  certain  investments  with  an  aggregate  amount  of  approximately  RMB692  million  from 

investments in associates to FVPL as a result of changes in nature of these investments.

(c) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group disposed of certain investments with an aggregate amount of RMB14,805 

million, which are mainly engaged in the provision of Internet-related services.

(d) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group made a large number of individual investments recognised as FVPL, but 

none of them was significant enough to trigger the disclosure requirements pursuant to Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules at the 

time when the Group made such investments.

(e)  Management has assessed the level of influence that the Group exercises on certain FVPL with shareholding exceeding 20%. 

Since  these  investments  are  either  held  in  form  of  redeemable  instruments  or  interests  in  limited  life  partnership  without 

significant influence, these investments have been classified as FVPL.

Some  online  advertising  customers  and  agencies  are  usually  granted  with  a  credit  period  within  90  days  after  full 

execution  of  the  contracted  advertisement  orders.  Third  party  platform  providers  usually  settle  the  amounts  due  by 

them within 60 days. Other customers, mainly including content production related customers and FinTech and cloud 

customers, are usually granted with a credit period within 90 days.

As of 31 December 2017, impairment provision was recognised after assessment of the financial condition and credit 

quality with reference to the past history. Beginning from 1 January 2018, the Group applies the simplified approach 

permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the assets. The 

provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivables with 

similar credit risk characteristics and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. The historical observed default rates are 

updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed at year end. For the year ended 31 December 2018 

and 2017, loss allowance made against the gross amounts of accounts receivable were not significant, and provision 

matrix is not presented.

As at 31 December 2018, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable approximated their fair values.

32  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with  limited  liabilities  in  the  PRC,  appropriation  of  net  profit  (after  offsetting  accumulated  losses  from  prior  years)  should  be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profit (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 33(d)).

(d) 

The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investment in equity instruments in other comprehensive 

income,  as  explained  in  Note  2.16.  These  changes  are  accumulated  with  FVOCI  reserve  with  equity.  The  Group  transfers 

amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity instruments are derecognised.

(e) 

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the dilution of interests in subsidiaries mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

a non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, Tencent Music Entertainment Group (“TME”), have undergone initial public 

offering by listing of certain of its new shares on the New York Stock Exchange with proceeds of approximately RMB3,520 

million, and thus the Group’s equity interest in TME was diluted. Given TME remains a subsidiary of the Group following 

the said initial public offering, this transaction was accounted for as transaction with non-controlling interest with a gain of 

RMB1,312 million directly recognised in equity; and

(ii) 

an equity transaction of a non-wholly owned subsidiary described in Note 7(d), which results in the transaction with non-

controlling interests of approximately RMB1,121 million.

Annual Report 2018Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 2018 
 
33  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted five share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II, the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme II expired on 31 

December 2011, 23 March 2014 and 16 May 2017, respectively. Upon the expiry of these schemes, no further 

options would be granted under these schemes, but the options granted prior to such expiry continued to be valid 

and exercisable in accordance with provisions of the schemes.

In  respect  of  the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  III  and  the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  IV  which  continue  to  be  in 

force, the Board may, at its discretion, grant options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the 

Company, subject to the terms and conditions stipulated therein. The exercise price must be in compliance with 

the requirement under the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange. In addition, the option 

vesting period is determined by the Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 10-year period for 

the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and a 7-year period for the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV after the date of grant of 

option.

The outstanding share options as of 31 December 2018 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal 

basis as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised after a specified period ranging from ten 

months to three years from the grant date, and then the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each 

subsequent year.

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Binomial Model to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2018 was HKD127.43 per share (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB103.46  per  share)  (2017:  HKD71.30  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately 

RMB62.86 per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend  yield  and  expected  volatility,  are  required  to  be  made  by  the  directors  in  applying  the  Binomial 

Model, which are summarised as below.

The expected volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is determined based on the 

average daily trading price volatility of the shares of the Company.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted two share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”) as of 31 December 2018, 

which are administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group. The vesting period of the awarded 

shares is determined by the Board.

Movements in the number of awarded shares for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

33  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Share award schemes (Cont’d)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  39,500  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent  non-

executive  directors  of  the  Company  (2017:  60,000  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent  non-

executive directors of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2018  was 

HKD374.32  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB316.30  per  share)  (2017:  HKD274.02  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB238.37 per share)).

The  outstanding  awarded  shares  as  of  31  December  2018  were  divided  into  one  to  five  tranches  on  an  equal 

basis as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging 

from four months to three years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each 

subsequent year.

(c)  Employee investment schemes

For  aligning  the  interests  of  key  employees  with  the  Group,  the  Group  established  six  employees’  investment 

plans in the form of limited liability partnerships in 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (the  “EIS”) respectively. 

According to the term of the EISs, the Board may, at its absolute discretion, invite any qualifying participants of the 

Group, excluding any director of the Company, to participate in the EISs by subscribing for the partnership interest 

at cash consideration. The participating employees are entitled to all the economic benefits generated by the EISs, 

if any, after a specified vesting period under the respective EISs, ranging from four to seven years. Wholly-owned 

subsidiaries of the Company acting as general partner of these EISs administer and in essence, control the EISs. 

These EISs are therefore consolidated by the Company as structured entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 were 

insignificant to the Group.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 201833  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the respective board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion. 

The  share  options  or  restricted  shares  of  the  subsidiaries  granted  are  normally  vested  by  several  tranches. 

Participants of some subsidiaries have the right to request the Group to repurchase their vested equity interests 

of  the  respective  subsidiaries  (“Repurchase  Transaction”).  The  Group  has  discretion  to  settle  the  Repurchase 

Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Company or by cash. For the Repurchase Transaction which 

the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company are currently of the view that they would be settled 

by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are accounted for using the equity-settled share-based 

payment method.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31

40  BUSINESS COMBINATION

(a)  Step-up acquisition of New Classics Media

On 31 October 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiary, China Literature Limited 

(“China  Literature”),  acquired  entire  equity  interests  in  New  Classic  Media  Holdings  Limited  (“New  Classics 

Media”), an existing associate of the Group, which is engaged in the production and distribution of television series, 

web series and films in the PRC (the “Step-up Acquisition”). The investment in New Classics Media was initially 

accounted for as FVPL, and subsequently reclassified as an associate of the Group due to additional investments 

and board representation. Immediately before the Step-up Acquisition, the Group held 44.08% equity interests 

in New Classics Media (the “Previously Held Interests”). Upon completion of the Step-up Acquisition, the Group 

indirectly held approximately 56% equity interests in New Classics Media through China Literature and accounted 

for it as a subsidiary of the Group. The Group expects the acquisition of New Classics Media to further increase its 

market share in entertainment industry.

Goodwill of approximately RMB6,933 million was recognised as a result of the Step-up Acquisition. It was mainly 

attributable  to  the  operating  synergies  and  economies  of  scale  expected  to  be  derived  from  combining  the 

operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose. The Group chose to record 

the non-controlling equity interests in New Classics Media at fair value on Acquisition Date.

The following table summarises the purchase consideration, fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and 

the non-controlling interest recognised as at the Acquisition Date.

40  BUSINESS COMBINATION (Cont’d)

(a)  Step-up acquisition of New Classics Media (Cont’d)

Note:

Pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the consideration will be settled by a combination of cash and new shares paid and 

issued by China Literature and will be subject to the earn-out mechanism set forth in the share purchase agreement.  “Monte 

Carlo Simulation Method” was used in this exercise to measure the value of the contingent consideration. The future net profit 

of New Classics Media was simulated in numerous scenarios based on the assumptions of growth rate and volatility of net profit 

of New Classics Media. For each scenario, the consideration to be paid in the form of cash and shares would be determined in 

accordance with the earn-out mechanism set out in the share purchase agreement. Such consideration was then discounted 

at a rate that reflects the associated risk of the payment to arrive the present value of consideration in a scenario. The value of 

contingent consideration was obtained by the average of the present value of considerations in these scenarios. As at 31 October 

2018, other financial liabilities of approximately RMB3,301 million in relation to this arrangement was recognised in the Group’s 

consolidated statement of financial position based on the earn-out mechanism.

The revenue and the results contributed by New Classics Media to the Group for the period since the Acquisition Date were 

insignificant. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different should the Step-up Acquisition have 

otherwise occured on 1 January 2018.

The financial impacts recorded as “Other gains, net” during the year ended 31 December 2018 for the difference between the 

fair value of the Previously Held Interests and the existing carrying amount of investment in an associate at the Acquisition Date 

were insignificant.

The related transaction costs of the Step-up Acquisition are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(b)  Other business combination

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  the  Group  also  acquired  certain  insignificant  subsidiaries.  The 

aggregate  considerations  for  these  acquisitions  was  approximately  RMB3,077  million,  fair  value  of  net  assets 

acquired  (including  identifiable  intangible  assets),  non-controlling  interests  and  goodwill  recognised  were 

approximately RMB1,426 million, RMB1,003 million and RMB2,654 million, respectively.

The revenue and the results contributed by these acquired subsidiaries for the period since respective acquisition 

date were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different 

if these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2018.

The  related  transaction  costs  of  these  business  combinations  were  not  material  to  the  Group’s  consolidated 

financial statements.

46  SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTROLLED STRUCTURED ENTITIES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non-wholly owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(c) 

All  subsidiaries’  undertakings  are  included  in  the  consolidation.  The  proportion  of  the  voting  rights  in  the  subsidiary’s 

undertakings held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company 

further does not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As at 31 December 2018, cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB86,468 

million were held in Mainland China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and treasury regulations. 

The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment of dividends, share 

repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 33(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 33(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes 

  which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2018,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB2,187  million  (2017:  RMB2,232 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
