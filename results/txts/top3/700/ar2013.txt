Chairman

I am pleased to present our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012 to the shareholders.

RESULTS

The  Group’s  audited  profit  attributable  to  equity  holders  of  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2012  was 

RMB12,732 million, an increase of 25% compared with the results for the previous year. Basic and diluted earnings per share 

for the year ended 31 December 2012 were RMB6.965 and RMB6.833 respectively.

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

2012 was a year of challenge and change, during which Tencent sharpened its focus on mobile Internet experiences.

From  a  macro  perspective,  China  experienced  slower  GDP  growth  amid  economic  uncertainties  in  Europe  and  the  US. 

China’s Internet user growth continued to decelerate during the year as the scale of Internet user base expanded further and 

penetration  reached  42%  at  the  end  of  2012  according  to  China  Internet  Network  Information  Center,  limiting  the  simple 

growth brought about by new Internet users. Nevertheless, engagement per user increased further as the Internet deepened its 

penetration into users’ daily lives and the value chains of different business sectors in China. As a result, business opportunities 

available on the Internet continued to broaden. We have been and will continue making substantial investment in our platforms 

and services to better serve our users and to catalyse the emergence of these business opportunities.

During the year, there was a significant shift in user activity from PC to mobile, driven by rapid expansion of China’s mobile 

Internet user base, enhanced capabilities of smartphones and increased adoption of compelling mobile applications. Offering a 

revolutionary user experience, the mobile Internet is reshaping existing business models and the industry value chain. Against 

this backdrop, Tencent and some peers have been aggressively investing in products and marketing to build their mobile user 

base, although business models on the mobile Internet remain uncertain and, in areas such as advertising and value-added 

services, monetisation lags behind traffic growth.

2012 witnessed the continued evolution of other major Internet sectors in China. For the online games sector, mobile games 

and web games increasingly supplemented client games as drivers of industry user growth, albeit from a relatively low base. In 

the online advertising sector, advertisers shifted part of their spending to video advertising and, more notably, to performance-

based social advertising. For the e-Commerce sector, B2C competition was intense but showed signs of moderation towards 

the end of the year, while transaction volumes maintained rapid growth.

Overall Financial Performance

We achieved significant growth in revenues and earnings in 2012. Our diversified business portfolio, focus on building user 

platforms, and commitment to creating healthy industry value chains have enabled Tencent to remain resilient despite rapid 

and unpredictable value migration within the Internet industry.

– 

IVAS. Our online game business extended its leadership in China via new game genres, and achieved significant revenue 

contributions from international markets. For our community and open platforms, the year saw healthy revenue growth, 

primarily driven by a strong increase in item-based sales within applications on our open platforms.

–  MVAS. The business benefited from revenue growth in mobile games and our bundled SMS packages. Mobile books 

also demonstrated promising growth potential.

–  Online advertising. We achieved above-industry-average revenue growth rates, primarily due to performance-based social 

advertising, as well as market share gains in portal and online video advertising.

5

Annual Report 2012– 

e-Commerce transactions. In 2012, we stepped up the scale of our B2C e-Commerce transactions business. Despite a 

highly competitive environment, we achieved significant growth in transaction volume and revenues through the year.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the year-on-year growth rates of our revenues and earnings remained robust.

– 

IVAS. On a year-on-year basis, our online game business benefited from increased activity of our major titles, higher 

contributions from international markets and new self-developed titles launched during 2012. Item-based sales on our 

open platforms enjoyed strong year-on-year revenue growth.

–  MVAS. Overall year-on-year revenue growth rate of the business reduced mainly due to slower subscriptions growth for 

our bundled SMS packages. Mobile games and mobile books continued to grow significantly compared to the same 

period last year.

–  Online advertising.  The  business  sustained  significant  revenue  growth  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  mainly  driven  by 

performance-based social advertising, video advertising and search advertising on our e-Commerce platforms. Traditional 

brand display advertising also registered solid growth.

–  e-Commerce transactions. Principal transactions grew sequentially as a result of seasonal promotions and geographic 

expansion  in  southern  China  from  the  original  eastern  China  base.  Transaction  volume  on  our  marketplaces  also 

increased on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

Strategic Highlights

In 2012, we established strong presence in a wide range of mobile application categories such as communications, social 

networking, media, security and browser. We have developed some of China’s most popular mobile applications, including 

Wireless  QQ  and  Weixin.  While  we  will  continue  to  invest  aggressively  in  developing  and  marketing  independent  mobile 

services such as our security product and web browser, we are also organically integrating new applications into Weixin, which 

can enhance our users’ experience while leveraging their existing social connections.

We reinforced and extended our social leadership during the year, with continued user expansion on our core platforms. We 

also deepened the integration of these platforms to further improve user engagement and enhanced the mobilisation of PC-

oriented platforms to cater for increasing usage of the mobile Internet. Meanwhile, our open platforms continued to grow and 

create value for users and third-party developers.

In  May  2012,  we  announced  a  re-organisation  of  our  business  units  into  six  new  business  groups  and  a  wholly-owned 

subsidiary focusing on e-Commerce business. This allows us to optimise resource allocation, to reinforce our entrepreneurial 

spirit, execution and innovation, and to sharpen our focus on users’ needs. Each business line continues to leverage company-

wide synergies under the new organisational structure.

6

Tencent Holdings LimitedOur  business  is  increasingly  benefitting  from  investments  we  have  made  in  companies  whose  products  or  services  are 

complementary to our own. For example, Riot Games’ LoL has attained widespread popularity, strengthening our game portfolio 

in  China  and  broadening  our  game  revenue  internationally.  During  2012,  we  continued  to  selectively  invest  in  companies 

where we see opportunities for long-term strategic benefits, notably businesses which can supply first-class products into our 

platforms, and businesses which we see as driving change in the Internet industry. For example, we purchased minority stakes 

in  Epic  Games,  a  US-based  development  team  with  a  long  history  of  creating  popular  games  and  a  market-leading  game 

development engine, and in Kakao, a leading mobile messaging service provider in Korea.

We completed a USD600 million senior unsecured notes offering in September 2012. This is our second international bond 

issue,  following  our  first  tranche  in  December  2011,  reflecting  investors’  confidence  in  our  business  model  and  financial 

performance. We remain firmly committed to maintaining our strong credit profile and investment grade credit ratings.

Divisional and Product Highlights

Communications Platforms

QQ  IM,  the  largest  online  community  in  China,  grew  steadily  in  2012.  MAU  reached  798  million  at  the  end  of  2012, 

representing a year-on-year growth rate of 11%, which was broadly in line with the Internet user growth rate in China. PCU 

increased by 16% year-on-year to 176 million. Driven by increasing adoption of the mobile Internet, our mobile user base grew 

more rapidly compared to our PC user base.

Weixin  enjoyed  substantial  user  growth  in  2012,  thanks  to  its  innovative  features  and  compelling  user  experience.  It  has 

quickly become a major communications and social platform for smartphone users in China. Beyond the domestic market, we 

have launched the product “WeChat” which leverages Weixin’s technology to serve the international markets. Recently, total 

registered user accounts of Weixin and WeChat have exceeded 300 million.

Social Platforms

Our leading social networks registered solid growth, with increase in the scale and activity of mobile users. MAU of Qzone 

increased by 9% year-on-year to 603 million at the end of 2012, while MAU of Pengyou increased by 22% to 247 million. 

Weixin Moments, a feature within Weixin which enables users to share experiences with friends on their Weixin contact lists, 

enjoyed rapid user adoption.

Media Platforms

In 2012, our media platforms expanded further with enhanced media influence and brand position. QQ.com maintained its 

position as the most-visited portal in China with solid traffic growth, leveraging the opportunities presented by the London 

Olympic Games. We also extended our vertical channels, such as news and finance, to the mobile Internet via vertical-specific 

smartphone applications. Tencent Microblog reached 87 million DAU at the end of 2012. As the growth of microblog users in 

China decelerates, we are exploring integration points between Tencent Microblog and Weixin to deepen our differentiation. 

Tencent  Video  gained  significant  audience  share  during  the  year  riding  on  content  enrichment  and  user  experience 

enhancement, and has become one of the leading online video platforms in China in terms of unique visitors and video views.

7

Annual Report 2012IVAS

Our IVAS registered subscriptions count declined during 2012, primarily due to stringent measures we launched in the second 

quarter, which aimed to improve the quality of our subscriber base by cleaning up certain user accounts acquired through 

mobile channels, for whom fee collection was unlikely. To cater for users’ increasing activity on mobile, we are enriching the 

mobile-related features and privileges of our IVAS subscription services.

We operate multiple open platforms providing third-party application developers with access to a large user base across our 

diverse product portfolio, including Qzone, QQ Game, and Tencent Microblog. In 2012, we increased significantly the number 

of third-party applications on our open platforms by collaborating with more developers and enhancing the support we provide 

to them. With increased user base and user activity, we achieved rapid growth in item-based sales within applications. To 

position for future growth opportunities, we are extending our open platforms to the mobile Internet and enriching our platforms 

with a greater diversity of applications.

Our online game business extended its domestic leadership, supported by growth in our major titles and contribution from self-

developed titles launched during the year, including Legend of Yulong and Legend of Xuanyuan. We also achieved significant 

growth in international markets riding on the success of LoL. Our QQ Game Platform benefited from increased user activity and 

its PCU reached 8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. In the future, we will focus on strengthening our market leadership 

by further enriching our game portfolio and by increasing our penetration into the web game and mobile game sectors. We will 

also continue to explore opportunities in international markets.

MVAS

In 2012, our MVAS business registered steady revenue increase, mainly driven by our bundled SMS packages and mobile 

games. In addition, mobile books registered strong revenue growth, albeit from a relatively low base.

During the year, we increased our focus on mobile games and expanded our game portfolio as we believe that the sector 

presents one of the key business opportunities on the mobile Internet. In addition, our mobile browser and mobile security 

product enhanced their market positions with significant user growth.

For certain key services such as QQ IM, Qzone and games, we managed the PC and mobile versions separately in the past. To 

deliver a unified user experience across platforms, we are now aligning the product development and management of these 

services between PC and mobile versions.

Online Advertising

Our online advertising business achieved strong revenue growth in 2012, underpinned by growth in brand display advertising 

and performance-based social advertising. In addition, search advertising registered growth.

8

Tencent Holdings LimitedIn  brand  display  advertising,  we  achieved  healthy  revenue  growth  and  market  share  gains  against  a  challenging  macro 

environment. We also leveraged the London Olympic Games to better penetrate selected up-scale brand advertisers. Riding 

on the rapid user and traffic growth of Tencent Video, our online video advertising revenues grew strongly during the year. 

Traditional brand display advertising experienced solid growth along with increased traffic and the enhanced media influence 

of our platforms.

In performance-based social advertising, we benefited significantly from the launch of our targeted advertising system on social 

networks, which was well-received by advertisers such as e-Commerce companies and application developers. Supported by 

greater impression volume and improved click-through rates, performance-based social advertising has become a significant 

revenue contributor to our online advertising business.

In search advertising, we benefited from the rapid growth of e-Commerce search and new contributions from mobile search. 

We  are  in  the  process  of  revamping  our  search  business  and  will  focus  on  improving  our  basic  search  experience  and 

operations.

e-Commerce Transactions

In  2012,  we  stepped  up  the  scale  of  our  B2C  e-Commerce  transactions  business  in  certain  product  categories,  such  as 

consumer electronics, and registered significant growth in transaction volume. During the year, we expanded our geographical 

coverage and increased investments in logistics and fulfillment infrastructure. Our business structure was also re-organised to 

enable more focused and efficient management.

Although the e-Commerce industry is highly competitive, we believe that it is an appealing downstream opportunity to leverage 

our competitive advantages which include our massive logged-in user base, our existing billing and payment relationships with 

consumers, our insight into our users’ interests, and our network’s ability to enhance “word-of-mouth” effect by users. Looking 

ahead, we will continue to expand our geographic presence in China, to improve user experience by investing in our business 

infrastructure and to explore new opportunities such as mobile commerce.

Outlook for 2013

During 2013, we intend to:

– 

Extend our communications and social leadership from PC to smartphone via applications such as Wireless QQ and 

Weixin, and enrich user experience by integrating additional services into these applications. Such additional services 

may include content applications, games, and location-based activities, among others.

– 

Take advantage of the disruptive opportunities which the mobile Internet creates to expand our product range and reach 

with users beyond what we have achieved on PC. In China, we are investing aggressively in our mobile security software 

and mobile browser services. Internationally, we are stepping up our marketing investment to acquire users for WeChat.

9

Annual Report 2012– 

Serve our users relevant content, products, and advertising by making appropriately targeted recommendations at the 

right time and under the right circumstances. We believe our logged-in relationship with users, together with our users’ 

desire to share experiences with friends via our communications and social platforms, will enable us to provide highly 

relevant recommendations and customisation, which represent competitive advantages in downstream activities such as 

e-Commerce, digital entertainment, and media content. We will continue to invest heavily in such downstream activities, 

including e-Commerce and advertising, so as to fully capture the revenue opportunities surrounding our platforms.

In view of the increasing integration between the PC and mobile Internet, we will combine the IVAS and MVAS segments in 

our financial reports and merge related revenue categories under IVAS and MVAS from the first quarter of 2013 onwards. We 

believe that this adjustment in financial reporting better reflects current market trends and our future business development.

DIVIDEND

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD1.00 per share (2011: HKD0.75 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2012, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the AGM. Such proposed dividend will be payable on 

30 May 2013 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 23 May 2013.

APPRECIATION

On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation and wholehearted gratitude to 

our employees for their dedication, commitment and their unabated innovation which keep the Group competitive and strong. 

The same thanks should also extend to our shareholders and stakeholders for their support and confidence which are highly 

valued both in the past and for the years to come.

–  QQ IM. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the user base of our core IM platform experienced organic growth compared to the 

same period last year and the previous quarter, mainly driven by the increase in Internet penetration and the expansion 

of mobile Internet user base in China.

–  Qzone. MAU of Qzone registered organic growth, both compared to the same period last year and the previous quarter.

–  QQ Game Platform. Peak simultaneous online user accounts of QQ Game Platform registered organic growth compared 

to the same period last year. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was primarily due to weaker seasonality and reduced 

promotional activities.

– 

IVAS subscriptions. IVAS registered subscriptions decreased as compared to the same period last year and the previous 

quarter. This mainly reflected stringent measures we launched in the second quarter of 2012, which aim to improve the 

quality of our subscriber base by cleaning up certain user accounts acquired through telecommunications operators, for 

whom fee collection was unlikely.

–  MVAS subscriptions. MVAS registered subscriptions increased compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by 

growth in our bundled SMS packages and mobile books. Sequentially, MVAS registered subscriptions remained broadly 

stable as growth in mobile books was offset by a decrease in our bundled SMS packages and the closure of certain niche 

applications.

Total revenues

– 

Revenues from our IVAS business increased by 1% to RMB8,456 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third 

quarter  of  2012.  Online  game  revenues  amounted  to  RMB5,990  million,  broadly  stable  compared  to  the  previous 

quarter.  We  registered  growth  in  revenues  from  international  markets  and  new  self-developed  titles.  These  factors 

were largely offset by the impact of weaker seasonality in China and our focus on future expansion packs for several 

major titles. Revenues from our community and open platforms climbed by 3% to RMB2,466 million. This primarily 

reflected an increase in revenues from item-based sales within applications on our open platforms. Revenues from QQ 

Membership also increased as a result of promotional activities.

– 

Revenues from our MVAS business decreased by 1% to RMB934 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third 

quarter  of  2012.  This  mainly  reflected  a  decrease  in  revenues  from  our  bundled  SMS  packages,  partially  offset  by 

revenue growth from our mobile games and mobile books.

– 

Revenues  from  our  online  advertising  business  decreased  by  7%  to  RMB947  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2012 

from the third quarter of 2012. This primarily reflected a decrease in brand display advertising revenues driven by the 

absence of the positive impact arising from the London Olympic Games, as well as weaker seasonality, partially offset 

by increased revenues from performance-based social advertising on our social networks and search advertising on our 

e-Commerce platforms.

– 

Revenues from our e-Commerce transactions business increased by 48% to RMB1,684 million for the fourth quarter of 

2012 from the third quarter of 2012. This mainly reflected an increase in volume of principal e-Commerce transactions 

as a result of seasonal promotional activities and geographic expansion in southern China from the original eastern China 

base. Fees generated from transactions on our marketplaces also increased.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 10% to RMB5,273 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter 

of 2012. This mainly reflected greater cost of merchandise sold and higher bandwidth and server custody fees, partially offset 

by lower sharing and content costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 43% for the fourth quarter 

of 2012 from 41% for the third quarter of 2012. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of business for the

Total cost of revenues

– 

Cost of revenues for our IVAS business increased by 2% to RMB2,800 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the 

third quarter of 2012. This mainly reflected an increase in bandwidth and server custody fees as well as equipment 

depreciation as a result of our business expansion. Sharing and content costs declined mainly due to a mix shift towards 

self-developed games.

– 

Cost of revenues for our MVAS business decreased by 2% to RMB381 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the 

third quarter of 2012. This was broadly in line with the change in revenues.

– 

Cost of revenues for our online advertising business decreased by 5% to RMB484 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 

from the third quarter of 2012. This mainly reflected the absence of content costs related to the London Olympic Games 

as well as lower commissions payable to advertising agencies accompanying the decrease in revenues, partially offset by 

an increase in bandwidth and server custody fees.

– 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  e-Commerce  transactions  business  increased  by  42%  to  RMB1,540  million  for  the  fourth 

quarter of 2012 from the third quarter of 2012. This was primarily driven by increased cost of merchandise sold due to 

growth in principal e-Commerce transactions.

Tencent Holdings Limited 
 
 
 
Other losses, net. Other losses, net amounted to RMB202 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to RMB15 million 

for the third quarter of 2012. This primarily reflected the absence of a special dividend income of RMB390 million from our 

investee company Mail.ru which was recognised in the previous quarter.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 34% to RMB1,095 million for the fourth quarter 

of 2012 from the third quarter of 2012. This primarily reflected seasonal e-Commerce promotions, increased marketing of 

online games as well as more intense marketing initiatives for WeChat in Asian markets, partially offset by a decrease in the 

spending  on  our  online  media  platforms  due  to  the  absence  of  the  London  Olympic  Games  as  compared  to  the  previous 

quarter. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expenses increased to 9% for the fourth quarter of 2012 from 7% 

for the third quarter of 2012.

General and administrative expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  5%  to  RMB2,124  million  for  the 

fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter of 2012. This was mainly driven by increases in staff costs and administrative 

expenses as a result of our business expansion. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses was 17% 

for the fourth quarter of 2012, broadly stable compared to the third quarter of 2012.

Finance costs, net. Finance  costs,  net  decreased  by  37%  to  RMB63  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2012  from  the  third 

quarter of 2012. This primarily reflected the recognition of foreign exchange gain on our foreign currency denominated debts 

resulting from exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense amounted to RMB151 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to RMB756 

million for the third quarter of 2012. This mainly reflected a reversal of income tax expense for a subsidiary in China which 

was qualified in the fourth quarter of 2012 to enjoy a lower CIT rate, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities 

recognised  in  respect  of  withholding  taxes  applicable  on  unremitted  retained  earnings  expected  to  be  paid  by  our  PRC 

subsidiaries to their overseas parent companies.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 8% to 

RMB3,464 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company increased by 15% to RMB4,068 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter of 2012.

Revenues  from  our  IVAS  business  increased  by  39%  to  RMB31,995  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2012 

from the year ended 31 December 2011. Online game revenues increased by 44% to RMB22,849 million. This was 

primarily driven by growth in our major titles, contributions from new titles launched in 2012, increased contributions 

from international markets, and continued growth in our QQ Game  Platform. Revenues from our community and open 

platforms increased by 27% to RMB9,146 million, mainly riding on growth in our open platforms and QQ Membership 

subscription service. Revenues from our open platforms grew primarily due to a significant increase in usage of third-

party applications, and consequently sales of virtual items within such applications. Revenues from QQ Membership 

benefited from the expansion in our IM user base as well as enhancements in privileges and value-added functions.

– 

Revenues  from  our  MVAS  business  increased  by  14%  to  RMB3,723  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2012 

from the year ended 31 December 2011. This was primarily driven by growth in revenues from mobile games and our 

bundled SMS packages. Mobile books also contributed to the growth of the business.

– 

Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 70% to RMB3,382 million for the year ended 31 December 

2012 from the year ended 31 December 2011. This mainly reflected new revenue contribution from performance-based 

social  advertising  and  growth  in  video  advertising.  Traditional  brand  display  advertising  and  search  advertising  also 

contributed to our business growth.

Total cost of revenues

– 

Cost of revenues for our IVAS business increased by 39% to RMB10,596 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 

from the year ended 31 December 2011. This was mainly driven by sharing costs for licensed game titles. Staff costs as 

well as bandwidth and server custody fees also increased as our business scale grew.

– 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  MVAS  business  increased  by  17%  to  RMB1,468  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December 

2012 from the year ended 31 December 2011. This primarily reflected increases in bandwidth and server custody fees, 

equipment depreciation as well as sharing costs.

– 

Cost of revenues for our online advertising business increased by 118% to RMB1,733 million for the year ended 31 

December 2012 from the year ended 31 December 2011. This mainly reflected the allocation of a significant proportion 

of costs related to our online video platform, which include content costs as well as bandwidth and server custody fees, 

to the online advertising segment since the fourth quarter of 2011. It also reflected increases in staff costs, sharing costs 

for our search advertising business and commissions payable to advertising agencies.

– 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  e-Commerce  transactions  business  amounted  to  RMB4,193  million  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2012.

Other (losses)/gains, net. We recorded other losses, net of RMB284 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, compared 

to other gains, net of RMB421 million for the year ended 31 December 2011. The change primarily reflected the absence 

of deemed disposal gains of RMB708 million recognised in the previous year as a result of the Riot Games Acquisition and 

the Gamegoo Acquisition, and an increase in impairment provision against selected investee companies. These factors were 

partially offset by the recognition of a special dividend income of RMB390 million from our investee company Mail.ru and an 

increase in subsidies and tax rebates in the year ended 31 December 2012.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 56% to RMB2,993 million for the year ended 

31 December 2012 from the year ended 31 December 2011. This mainly reflected an increase in advertising and promotional 

activities on products and platforms such as online games and mobile applications, as well as spending related to the London 

Olympic  Games.  Staff  costs  also  increased  along  with  our  business  expansion.  As  a  percentage  of  revenues,  selling  and 

marketing expenses was 7% for the year ended 31 December 2012, broadly stable compared to the year ended 31 December 

2011.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 47% to RMB7,765 million for the year 

ended 31 December 2012 from the year ended 31 December 2011. This was primarily driven by increases in research and 

development expenses, staff costs and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in intangible asset amortisation 

as certain intangible assets acquired through acquisition were fully amortised in the first quarter of 2012. As a percentage of 

revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 18% for the year ended 31 December 2012 from 19% for the 

year ended 31 December 2011.

Finance (costs)/income, net. We  recorded  finance  costs,  net  of  RMB348  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2012, 

compared to finance income, net of RMB36 million for the year ended 31 December 2011. The change was mainly driven 

by higher interest expense and the recognition of foreign exchange losses on our foreign currency denominated debts due to 

exchange rate movements in the year ended 31 December 2012.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 21% to RMB2,266 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 from 

the year ended 31 December 2011. This primarily reflected: 1) higher profit before income tax; 2) an increase in deferred 

tax liabilities recognised in respect of withholding taxes applicable on unremitted retained earnings expected to be paid by 

our PRC subsidiaries to their overseas parent companies; and 3) lower reversal of deferred tax liabilities arising from the Riot 

Games Acquisition. These factors were partially offset by a reversal of income tax expense for a subsidiary in China which was 

qualified in the fourth quarter of 2012 to enjoy a lower CIT rate.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 25% 

to  RMB12,732  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2012  from  the  year  ended  31  December  2011.  Non-GAAP  profit 

attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 31% to RMB14,286 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 

from the year ended 31 December 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To  supplement  the  consolidated  results  of  the  Group  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS,  certain  non-GAAP  financial 

measures, including non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP profit for the year/period, non-GAAP 

net margin and non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, have been presented in this annual report. 

These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the 

Company’s financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be 

defined differently from similar terms used by other companies.

held  in  deposits  and  investments  denominated  in  non-RMB  currencies.  Since  there  are  no  cost-effective  hedges  against 

the fluctuation of RMB and no effective manner to generally convert a significant amount of non-RMB currencies into RMB, 

which is not a freely exchangeable currency, there is a risk that we may experience a loss as a result of any foreign currency 

exchange rate fluctuations in connection with our deposits and investments.

Annual Report 2012 
 
Strong corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The Board views effective corporate 

governance practices as priority, with the aim of providing our investors a thorough understanding of the Group’s management 

and how the different businesses of the Group are managed. Our belief is that investors will recognise significant long-term 

value when the Group’s businesses are conducted in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in 

hand with strong corporate governance, and we believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will create trust with 

the public and ultimately create value for investors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The Company has complied with the applicable code provisions of the Code on Corporate Governance Practices as set out in 

former Appendix 14 to the Listing Rules from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012 (the “Former Code”) and has complied with 

the applicable code provisions as set out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from the code provisions A.2.1 regarding the 

segregation of the role of the chairman and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes at 

an appropriate time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s 

execution of this strategy.

By  discharging  its  responsibilities,  the  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be 

responsible, and these matters reserved for the Board have been separately defined, and are reviewed periodically, to ensure 

that the Company maintains the proper level of corporate governance. In this regard, the Board:

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual budget and business plan

appoints the CEO, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned

approves the Company’s financial statements, quarterly, interim and annual reports

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  dedicates  certain  matters  which  require  particular 

time, attention and expertise to be devoted to its Committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt 

with by the Committees as they require independent oversight and specialists input. As such, the Board has established five 

Committees  to  assist  the  Board:  Audit  Committee,  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  Nomination 

Committee and Remuneration Committee. Each of the Committees has terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers 

and authorities. All Committees report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

53

• 

• 

54

Tencent Holdings LimitedThe work of the Committees during the year 2012 is set out on pages 59 to 62.

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the Company Secretary, with a view to ensuring the Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expenses for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe ongoing education and training, as well as participation in director education programs, is important for maintaining 

a current and effective Board. In order to ensure the directors are aware of their responsibilities as directors of the Company, 

and for the Company to take advantage of their rich mix of knowledge and experience, it is our practice that new directors have 

to undergo an orientation programme and the existing directors have to attend a comprehensive, formal and tailored training 

on their duties and responsibilities as directors provided by external professional advisors that includes written materials, oral 

presentations and meetings with senior management team. New directors would also receive a directors’ handbook on their 

responsibilities under the Listing Rules, applicable legal requirements and other regulatory requirements and the business 

and governance policies of the Company, which was last updated in November 2012. Trainings will be provided by external 

advisors on a regular basis in relation to any updates of laws and regulations which relate to the Director’s responsibilities and 

the Company’s business to update the directors on the new amendments to the CG Code and Listing Rules.

Maintaining  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  integrity  cannot  depend  solely  on  the  Board’s  efforts,  each  of  the 

Group’s employees is also required to contribute to such cause. The Company thus distributes a code of conduct policy which 

emphasises on honesty and respect is distributed to all employees and forms part of their service contracts. This handbook is 

updated when necessary.

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  in 

compliance with the CG Code.

The Listing Rules and the CG Code have been amended in 2012. We welcome these changes as we believe as time evolves, 

the  investor  community  expects  a  higher  level  of  corporate  governance  and  transparency  of  listed  companies.  We  have 

improved and implemented the following changes to our corporate governance practices to address these amendments:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Formulation of a shareholders communication policy which was approved by the Board on 14 March 2012

Trainings have been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on 

any updates to the Listing Rules and the laws

Corporate Governance Committee was established on 14 March 2012

Company Secretary attends trainings in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements

Informal updates and structured monthly updates on the Company’s performance, position and prospects are provided 

to the directors

55

Annual Report 2012Chairman and CEO

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and CEO of the Company. This is at variance with code provision A.2.1 of the Former 

Code and the CG Code, which provides that the roles of Chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and CEO must be proficient in 

IT knowledge and be sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, in order to promote 

the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the role of the Chairman and CEO may 

create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate Committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time to 

make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board and 

Committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for discussion for 

all items. During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-executive directors (including 

the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive directors, presenting diversified perspectives 

for the Chairman to consider.

The Board is therefore of the view that there are adequate balance of power and safeguards in place. Nevertheless, the Board 

will continue to monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary changes at an appropriate time.

Composition

The Board currently comprises a total of eight directors, with three executive directors, two non-executive directors and three 

independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2012 and up to the date of this annual report, the 

changes to the composition of the Board were as follows:

• 

• 

Mr Antonie Andries Roux passed away on 24 June 2012 and ceased to be an non-executive director on the same date

Mr Jacobus Petrus Bekker was appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 14 November 2012

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 37 to 39 of this annual report.

In  order  for  the  Group  to  take  advantage  of  the  skills  and  experiences  and  in  order  for  the  directors  to  ensure  that  they 

give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request the directors to disclose to the Company quarterly  the 

number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant commitments. The Board’s 

composition is in compliance with the new requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that the number of independent 

non-executive  directors  must  represent  at  least  one-third  of  the  Board.  The  Board  believes  that  the  balance  between  the 

executive directors and non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient checks and balances that 

safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

56

Tencent Holdings LimitedThe Board values the importance of independent judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group 

by  expressing  their  views  and  actively  participate  in  Board  and  Committee  meetings  and  to  bring  independent  judgment 

and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, performance, conflicts of interest and management process, with the 

shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. Further, in compliance with Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules,  one 

of our independent non-executive directors has the appropriate professional qualifications or accounting or related financial 

management expertise, who provides valuable advice from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from 

each independent non-executive director a confirmation of his independence and the Nomination Committee of the Company 

has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all  independent  non-executive  directors  are  independent,  taking  into 

account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules. No independent non-executive director has 

served the Company for more than nine years.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

Appointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the right membership of the Board, we can benefit from the right set 

of skills and experience to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to maintain the established 

formal,  considered  and  transparent  procedure  for  the  appointment  of  new  directors  to  the  Board.  It  is  our  corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2012 Annual General Meeting, two directors (Mr Li Dong Sheng and Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce) retired and were re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

Since the Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by 

rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year, code provision A.4.2 of CG Code 

is deviated. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and development of the 

Group. At present, the Chairman’s continuing presence in the Board is vital to assure sustainable development of the Group. 

Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the relevant provision 

in the Articles of Association has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

As Mr Ian Charles Stone, who was re-elected in 2009 Annual General Meeting, was not considered at the 2012 Annual General 

Meeting, code provision A.4.2 of CG Code is deviated. Mr Ian Charles Stone’s re-election will be considered at the AGM. The 

Board considers that such deviation from code provision A.4.2 of CG Code does not have any material impact on the operation 

of the Group as a whole.

57

Annual Report 2012Board Activity

The Board meets four times during the year as a minimum and, during the year of 2012, it met five times. The attendance of

Mr Antonie Andries Roux passed away and ceased to be a non-executive director on 24 June 2012.

Mr Jacobus Petrus Bekker was appointed as a non-executive director on 14 November 2012.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed on a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial 

and operational performances, approved the annual, interim and quarterly results of the Group, the appointments of director, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The Company Secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agendas for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  Company  Secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The Company Secretary sends the agendas, 

board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least three days in advance of each 

Board meeting and Committee meetings, and to keep the directors updated on the Group’s financial performance and latest 

developments.  If  any  director  raises  any  queries,  steps  will  be  taken  to  respond  to  such  queries  as  promptly  and  fully  as 

possible. If there is a potential conflict of interest involving a substantial shareholder or a director, that particular matter will be 

discussed in a physical meeting instead of being dealt with by written resolutions, and such director will abstain from voting on 

matters in which he has an interest. The directors may approach the Company’s senior management team when necessary. 

The directors may also retain independent professional advisors at the Company’s expense if necessary.

58

and  the  Board  on  all  governance-related  matters  and  provides  general  advice  to  the  Board.  The  Company  Secretary  is

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

ACCOUNTS, RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects are presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position, to give the directors a balanced and understandable assessment of 

the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides all necessary and relevant 

information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and information it needs to discharge their responsibilities. 

The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the Auditor’s Report.

The Board also has the responsibility to oversee the risks undertaken by the Group, and to actively consider, analyse and 

formulate strategies to control the risks the Group is exposed to, and determines the level of risk the Company wishes to and is 

able to take. The senior management team monitors these risks and develops effective systems and mechanisms to mitigate 

risks to an acceptable level as determined by the Board. The senior management team reports to the Board periodically and 

whenever necessary on the risks the Group faces and the actions taken to mitigate them.

An  adequate  and  effective  internal  control  system  is  key  to  mitigate  risk  and  to  safeguard  shareholders’  interests  and  the 

Group’s assets against any unauthorised use or disposition. The internal control system should also ensure the maintenance 

of proper accounting records for the provision of reliable financial information for internal use or for publication and to ensure 

that the Group is in compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. The Board is responsible for maintaining such internal 

control system. The Board has established a set of procedures to provide effective internal controls, which includes:

• 

establishing a distinct organisational structure with defined lines of authority and control responsibilities. Relevant group, 

division or department heads actively participate in the preparation of strategic plans for achieving annual operational 

and financial targets. These plans serve as the foundation for the preparation of the Group’s annual budget by which 

resources are  allocated in accordance with identified and prioritised business opportunities. The Board approves the 

annual operating plan and budget on an annual basis

62

Tencent Holdings Limited• 

if  there  are  any  variances  against  the  annual  budget,  these  variances  will  be  analysed  and  actions  will  be  taken  if 

necessary to rectify any deficiencies noted

• 

IA performs independent review of the operational areas and presents its findings and prospective audit plan to the Audit 

Committee on a quarterly basis

• 

IC facilitates the senior management team to ensure controls in operational processes are efficient and effective, and 

regularly communicates with the Audit Committee

The  IA  and  IC  provide  valuable  support  to  the  Company’s  internal  control  system.  The  IA  reviews  different  business  and 

functional operations and activities of the Group with a special focus on high risk areas. The IA also conducts ad hoc reviews 

in  areas  of  concern  identified  by  the  senior  management  team.  If  the  IA  identifies  any  deficiencies,  the  relevant  group, 

division or department heads will be notified on such deficiencies and will be rectified, following up with the implementation 

of audit recommendations. If the IA considers that the deficiency is a significant internal control weakness, such matter will 

be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and the Board if necessary. The IC oversees the overall risk management 

and the effectiveness of internal control based on the COSO Framework. The IC also provides advice on the setting up and 

implementation  of  policies  and  processes  to  promote  effective  internal  control.  The  overall  risk  management  and  internal 

control status will be reported to the Audit Committee.

The  Audit  Committee  reviews  the  internal  control  system  annually  on  behalf of  the  Board.  The  Board  is  satisfied  that  the 

Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  function  is  adequately  resourced  with  staff  of  appropriate  qualifications 

and  experience,  and  they  receive  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and  development.  Based  on  the  report  from  the 

Audit Committee, the Board is satisfied that the Company’s internal audit function is adequately resourced to manage the 

Group’s  risks  and  safeguard  the  Group’s  assets,  and  that  the  external  audit  process  has  been  effective.  The  Board,  with 

the recommendation of the Audit Committee, is satisfied that the Group has complied with the provisions regarding internal 

controls as required under the CG Code and is not aware of any significant issues that would have an adverse impact on the 

effectiveness and adequacy of the internal control system.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of 

the Group’s operations, business and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in annual general meetings and other general meetings or other proper means. As such, the Company has developed and 

maintains a shareholders communication policy which is available on the Company Website.

63

Annual Report 2012The Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the senior management team, under 

usual circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to the Company in an open manner. 

Except for the absence of Mr Zhang Zhidong, Mr Antonie Andries Roux, Mr Li Dong Sheng and Mr Jacobus Petrus Bekker (who 

was appointed after the 2012 Annual General Meeting was held), all directors attended the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 

The Company’s external auditor will also attend the annual general meeting to answer questions relating to the conduct of the 

audit, the auditor’s report and auditor independence. The Company’s shareholders may also propose candidates for election 

as a director of the Company according to the procedures set out in the Company Website.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the 

requisition not less than one-tenth of the paid up capital of the Company carrying the right of voting at general meetings of 

the Company shall at all times have the right, by written requisition to the Board or the Company Secretary, to require an 

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, separate resolutions will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a poll, 

detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions from 

shareholder on the voting procedures can be answered before the poll voting started. An external scrutineer will be appointed 

to monitor and count the votes cast by poll. Poll results will be posted on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s 

website after each general meeting.

Apart from participating in the Company’s general meetings, the Company’s shareholders are provided with contact details of 

the Company, such as telephone number, email address and postal address which are also available on the Company Website, 

in order to enable them to make any query that they may have. Shareholders may send their enquiries to the Board directly 

through these means. Shareholders may also contact the Company’s Hong Kong branch share registrar, Computershare Hong 

Kong Investor Services Limited, if they have any enquiries about their shareholdings and entitlements to dividends.

65

Annual Report 2012To the shareholders of Tencent Holdings Limited

(incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)

We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Tencent  Holdings  Limited  (the  “Company”)  and  its  subsidiaries 

(together, the “Group”) set out on pages 68 to 181, which comprise the consolidated and company statements of financial 

position  as  at  31  December  2012,  and  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive 

income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 

and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong 

Companies  Ordinance,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of 

consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted 

our  audit  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing.  Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical 

requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 

statements are free from material misstatement.

66

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s Report An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated 

financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks 

of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements 

that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 

appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 

evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

OPINION

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 

the Group as at 31 December 2012, and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 

International Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements 

of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

OTHER MATTERS

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not 

assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent  Holdings  Limited  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  in  the  Cayman  Islands.  The  address  of  its  registered 

office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The shares of the 

Company have been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) since 

16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally engaged in the provision of Internet value-added services (“IVAS”), mobile and telecommunications value-

added services (“MVAS”), online advertising services and e-Commerce transactions services to users in the People’s 

Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interest in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

and recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer without 

making any payment; and

• 

the right to control the management and financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2012(All amounts in RMB unless otherwise stated)1 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a subsidiary and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted 

for as a business combination between entities under common control under a method similar to the uniting of interests 

method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in 

management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as subsidiaries of the Company 

and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  approved  for  issue  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the 

Company (the “Board”) on 20 March 2013.

2 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 

convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and derivative financial instruments.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with IFRS  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

The new or revised standards and amendments to the existing standards, which are mandatory for the financial 

year of the Group beginning 1 January 2012, are either not currently relevant or have no material impact on the 

Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report 2012Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2012(All amounts in RMB unless otherwise stated)2 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

The following new and revised standards have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 

January 2012, and have not been early adopted by the Group.

• 

IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets 

and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009. It replaces certain parts of IAS 39 that relate to 

the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified 

into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. 

The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model 

for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For 

financial liabilities, IFRS 9 retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where 

the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own 

credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates 

an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9 and intends to adopt  this 

standard no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015.

• 

IFRS  10  ‘Consolidated  Financial  Statements’  builds  on  the  existing  principles  by  identifying  the  concept 

of control as the determining factor for whether an entity should be included in the consolidated financial 

statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination 

of  control  in  situations  where  assessment  is  difficult.  The  Group  is  yet  to  assess  the  full  impact  of  IFRS 

10  and  will  adopt  this  standard  from  1  January  2013.  According  to  the  preliminary  assessment  made, 

management  of  the  Group  does  not  expect  the  adoption  of  IFRS  10  would  have  material  impact  on  the 

Group’s consolidated financial statements.

• 

IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ is a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights 

and  obligations  of  the  arrangement  rather  than  its  legal  form.  There  are  two  types  of  joint  arrangement: 

joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the assets and 

obligations  relating  to  the  arrangement  and  hence  accounts  for  its  interest  in  assets,  liabilities,  revenue 

and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint operator has rights to the net assets of the arrangement 

and hence equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed. 

The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 11 and will adopt this standard from 1 January 2013. 

According to the preliminary assessment made, management of the Group does not expect the adoption of 

IFRS 11 would have material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

• 

IFRS  12  ‘Disclosures  of  Interests  in  Other  Entities’  includes  the  disclosure  requirements  for  all  forms  of 

interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off 

balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 12 and will adopt this standard 

from 1 January 2013.

IFRS  13  ‘Fair  Value  Measurement’  aims  to  improve  consistency  and  reduce  complexity  by  providing  a 

precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for 

use across IFRS. The requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on 

how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS. The 

Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 13 and will adopt this standard from 1 January 2013.

There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and would be expected to have a material 

impact on the Group.

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and  all  of  its 

subsidiaries made up to 31 December.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has the power to govern 

the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting 

rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible  are 

considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. The group also assesses existence 

of control where it does not have more than 50% of the voting rights but is able to govern the financial and 

operating  policies  by  virtue  of  de-facto  control.  De-facto  control  may  arise  from  circumstances  such  as 

enhanced minority rights or contractual terms between shareholders.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is established to the group. They are de-

consolidated from the date that control ceases.

Inter-company transactions, balances, unrealised gain or losses between group companies are eliminated. 

Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to  ensure  consistency  with  the 

policies adopted by the Group.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i)  Business combinations

The  Group  uses  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  to  account  for  business  combinations.  The 

consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, 

the  liabilities  incurred  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group. The  consideration  transferred 

includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 

are  measured  initially  at  their  fair  values  at  the  acquisition  date.  On  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 

non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net 

assets.

The  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred,  the  acquisition-date  fair  value  of  any  previous  equity 

interest  in  the  acquiree,  and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree  over  the 

identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill (Note 2.11). If this is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change 

to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, 

and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

For a business combination achieved in stages, the Group applies acquisition method at the acquisition 

date. The previously held interest is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and a gain or loss 

is recognised in the income statement. Goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of identifiable 

net  assets  from  the  fair  value  of  the  previously  held  interest,  the  consideration  and  non-controlling 

interests.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(ii)  Transactions with non-controlling interests

The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the 

Group. For purchase from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and 

the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. 

Gains or losses on disposal to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Partial disposals

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is 

remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement. 

The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained 

interest as an associate, a jointly controlled entity or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 

recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group 

had  directly  disposed  of  the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts  previously 

recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a 

proportionate  share  of  the  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are 

reclassified to the income statement where appropriate.

(b)  Separate financial statements

In  the  Company’s  statement  of  financial  position,  the investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at 

cost less impairment. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries 

are  accounted  for  by  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  dividends  received  and  receivable.  In  addition,  the 

contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in Note 10(c)), a controlled special purpose 

entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust” first, and then will be transferred  to  the 

“Shares held for share award scheme” under equity when the contribution is used for the acquisition for the 

shares of the Company.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying 

a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using 

the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The group’s investment in associates includes 

goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.

The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and 

its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other  comprehensive 

income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. 

When the Group’s share of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other 

unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 

payments on behalf of the associate.

The  Group  determines  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  investments  in 

associates  are  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference 

between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount within “Other 

gains/(losses), net” in the income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.4  Jointly controlled entities

The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method, which is similar to 

that for associates in Note 2.3 above. The Group’s share of its jointly controlled entities’ post-acquisition profits or 

losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive 

income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 

against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of loss in a jointly controlled entity equals 

or exceeds its interest in the jointly controlled entity, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does 

not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the jointly controlled 

entity.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments in jointly 

controlled entities are impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 

between the recoverable amount of the jointly controlled entities and its carrying value and recognises the amount 

within “Other gains/(losses), net” in the income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.5 

Investment in associate/jointly controlled entity achieved in stages

The cost of an associate/a jointly controlled entity acquired in stages is measured as the sum of the fair value of 

the interest previously held plus the fair value of any additional consideration transferred as of the date when it 

becomes an associate/a jointly controlled entity. A gain or loss on remeasurement of the previously held interest 

is taken to the income statement. Any other comprehensive income recognised in prior periods in relation to the 

previously held interest is also taken to the income statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the 

period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.7  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated 

financial  statements  are  presented  in  RMB,  which  is  both  the  functional  currency  of  the  Company  and 

presentation currency of the Group.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-

sale financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised 

cost of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences 

related to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the income statement, and 

other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation 

differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, 

are included in other comprehensive income.

2.7  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(c)  Group companies

The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary 

economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are translated into 

the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); 

and

(iii)  All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive 

income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

2.8  Fixed assets

All fixed assets are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge. 

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  cost  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

3 - 5 years

5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to fixed assets when completed and ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.13).

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised 

within “Other gains/(losses), net” in the income statement.

2.9 

Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  costs  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives of 50 years.

Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each 

reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.10 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease or capitalised in 

construction in progress upon completion of construction.

2.11 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, and represents 

the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable 

assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in 

the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

2.11 Intangible assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include licence, licensed online contents, computer software and technology 

and non-compete agreements. They are initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value of 

intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally two to seven years) using 

the straight-line method or other method reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic 

benefits are expected to be consumed.

2.12 Shares held for share award scheme

The  consideration  paid  by  the  Share  Scheme  Trust  for  purchasing  the  Company’s  shares  from  the  market, 

including any directly attributable incremental cost, is presented as “Shares held for share award scheme” and 

deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs of 

the awarded shares vested are credited to “Shares held for share award scheme”, with a corresponding adjustment 

to share premium.

2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 

at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial 

assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 

reporting date.

2.14 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans 

and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which 

the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets are quoted in an active 

market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

(i)  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.

(ii)  Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

Loans and receivables are classified as “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, “Loans 

to associates”, “Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the statement 

of financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 

classified in any other category. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 

to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.14 Financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the Group 

commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs 

for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value 

through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income 

statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments 

have  expired  or  have  been  transferred  and  the  Group  has  transferred  substantially  all  risks  and  rewards 

of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 

subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective 

interest method.

When securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 

value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement as gains 

and losses from investment securities.

Dividends on available-for-sale financial assets equity instruments are recognised in the income statement 

when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

2.15 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when 

there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 

basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired 

and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or 

more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event  (or 

events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets 

that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss 

is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may 

measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income 

statement.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-

sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the securities below its cost is 

considered  as  an  indicator  that  the  securities  are  impaired.  If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-

sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and 

the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the  income 

statement  –  is  removed  from  other  comprehensive  income  and  recognised  in  the  income  statement. 

Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the 

income statement.

2.17 Derivative financial instruments

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently  remeasured  at  their  fair  value.  The  method  of  recognising  the  resulting  gain  or  loss  depends  on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are accounted for at fair value through 

profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 

recognised immediately in the income statement within “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.18 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted 

average method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.19 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for merchandise sold or services performed in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable and other receivables is expected in one year or 

less, they are classified as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.20 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term  highly 

liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

2.21 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  share  capital  (treasury  share),  the  considerations 

paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 

equity  holders  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued,  any 

consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.22 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.23 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request 

the Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are 

met. If the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial assets under 

the put option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows 

under the put option. The financial liability is initially debited to equity at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group 

revises its estimates of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual 

and revised estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present 

value of revised estimated future cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the 

adjustments will be recognised as income or expenses in the income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.24 Borrowings and long-term notes

Borrowings and long-term notes issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over their period using the effective interest 

method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Long-term notes are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle 

the liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.25 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 

except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this 

case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of 

an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither 

accounting nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 

have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 

related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.26 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The Group contributes on a monthly basis to various defined contribution benefit plans organised by the 

relevant governmental authorities. The Group’s liability in respect of these plans is limited to the contributions 

payable in each period. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. Assets of the plans are held 

and managed by government authorities and are separated from those of the Group.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The  Group  operates  a  number  of  share-based  compensation  plans  (including  share  option  scheme  and 

share award scheme), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity 

instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of  the  employee 

services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments of the Group is recognised as an expense 

over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  the  period  over  which  all  of  the  specified  vesting  conditions  are  to  be 

satisfied, and credited to share-based compensation reserve under equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 

options granted by using an option-pricing model – Black-Scholes valuation model (the “BS Model”), which 

includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) but excludes 

the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award shares, the total 

amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant 

date. The Group also adopts valuation technique to assess the fair value of other equity instruments of the 

Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

2.26 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation expenses, which are recognised in the consolidated financial statement, are treated as part of 

the “Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

At each reporting period end, the Group and the Company revise their estimates of the number of options 

and awarded shares that are expected to ultimately vest. They recognise the impact of the revision of original 

estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement of the Group and in the “Investments in subsidiaries” 

of the Company, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the remaining vesting period.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

2.27 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 

the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.28 Revenue recognition

The Group principally derives revenues from provision of IVAS, MVAS, online advertising services and e-Commerce 

transactions services in the PRC.

(a) 

IVAS and MVAS

Revenues  from  IVAS  are  derived  principally  from  the  provision  of  online  games,  community  value-added 

services and applications across various Internet platforms.

MVAS revenues are derived principally from providing users with bundled SMS packages, mobile games, 

and other mobile value-added services such as mobile music and mobile books.

The  IVAS  and  MVAS  can  be  paid  by  way  of  prepaid  cards  and  tokens  (represented  a  specific  amount 

of  payment  unit)  sold  by  the  Group  through  channels  such  as  sales  agents  appointed  by  the  Group, 

telecommunication operators, broadband service providers, Internet cafes and banks. The end users can 

register  the  prepaid  cards  and  tokens  to  their  user  accounts  in  the  Group’s  platforms  and  then  access 

the Group’s online products or relevant services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid cards and tokens are 

deferred  and  recorded  as  “Deferred  revenue”  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  (see  Note  27).  The 

amounts  are  then  recognised  as  revenue  based  on  the  actual  utilisation  of  the  payment  unit:  (i)  when 

the  payment  unit  is  used  to  purchase  services,  the  revenue  is  recognised  when  the  related  services  are 

rendered;  (ii)  when  the  payment  unit  is  used  to  purchase  virtual  products/items  in  the  Group’s  Internet 

platforms, the revenue is recognised over the estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/items or 

over the expected user relationship.

Certain  IVAS  and  MVAS  are  directly  delivered  to  the  Group’s  customers  through  the  platforms  of  various 

subsidiaries of telecommunication operators in the PRC, namely China Mobile Communications Corporation 

(“China Mobile”), China United Network Communications Corporation Limited (“China Unicom”) and China 

Telecommunications  Corporation  (“China  Telecom”).  These  operators  collect  the  relevant  service  fees 

(the  “Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees”)  on  behalf  of  the  Group  and  are  entitled  to  certain  percentages 

commission fee (defined as “Mobile and Telecom Charges”). The Mobile and Telecom Charges are withheld 

and deducted from the gross Internet and Mobile Service Fees collected by the operators from the users, 

with the net amounts remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Internet and Mobile Service Fees as 

revenue on a gross basis and treats the Mobile and Telecom Charges as cost of revenues.

2.28 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a) 

IVAS and MVAS (Cont’d)

The Group also opens its Internet platforms to third-party game/application developers. The Group enters 

into cooperation agreements with  third-party game/application developers, pursuant to which the games/

applications  designed,  developed  and  hosted  by  third-party  developers  are  available  to  the  users  on  the 

Group’s  Internet  platforms.  The  respective  third-party  game/application  developers  are  responsible  for 

the  users’  experiences.  Under  the  terms  of  the  cooperation  agreements,  the  Group  pays  the  third-party 

developers a pre-determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from end users for the  virtual 

products/items utilised in these games/applications. The Group recognises the related revenue on a net basis 

because it acts as an agent in the arrangement. The Group also defers the related revenue over an estimated 

period of the respective products/items as there is an implicit obligation of the Group to maintain and allow 

access of the users of the games/applications operated by third-party game/application developers through 

its platforms.

Revenues derived from games/applications hosted by third-party developers on the Group’s Internet platform 

is presented within revenue from IVAS.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues are mainly derived from display advertising on instant messaging clients, portals, 

social networks and other platforms, and search advertising through the self-developed search engines of the 

Group. Commissions payable to advertising agencies are recognised as a component of the cost of revenues.

For advertising contracts based on the actual time period that the advertisements appear on the Group’s 

instant messaging clients, portals and other platforms, the revenues are recognised ratably over the period in 

which the advertisements are displayed.

2.28 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(c) 

e-Commerce transactions business

Revenues  derived  from  e-Commerce  transactions  business  primarily  arise  from  sales  of  merchandise 

through the Group’s Internet platforms. The Group recognises revenues from merchandise sales transaction 

and related costs on a gross basis when it acts as a principal. Following the guidance under IAS 18 “Revenue”, 

whether the Group acts as a principal is based on a number of criteria, including whether it is a primary 

obligor, whether it is subject to inventory risk, whether it has latitude in establishing prices, whether it has 

latitude in selecting suppliers, in a transaction. When the Group is not a principal and is instead acting as an 

agent, revenues are recognised on a net basis which is based on a pre-determined percentage of the sales.

For merchandise sold under e-Commerce transactions business, the customers place their orders  online 

with a commitment made at a fixed selling price. Payment for the purchased merchandise is made either 

before delivery or upon delivery. When the Group is acting as a principal, revenues, net of discounts and 

return allowances and value-added tax, are recognised when the merchandise is physically delivered to the 

respective customers. Return allowances, which reduce the gross amount of revenues, are estimated based 

on historical experience.

2.29 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

2.30 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

2.31 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.32 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.33 Dividends distribution

Dividends  distribution  to  the  Company’s  shareholders  is  recognised  as  a  liability  in  the  Group  and  Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders.

2.34 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development  costs  previously  recognised  as  expenses  are  not  recognised  as  assets  in  subsequent  periods. 

Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the assets are ready for use on a straight-line 

basis over their useful lives, not exceeding five years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group is subject to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and 

interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the 

potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out by the senior 

management of the Group including the executive directors of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

i)  Foreign exchange risk

The Group mainly operates in the PRC with most of the transactions settled in RMB. The conversion 

of RMB denominated balances into foreign currencies is subject to the rates and regulations of foreign 

exchange control promulgated by the PRC government. Therefore, to maintain the flexibility in activities 

including payment of dividends, share repurchases and offshore investments, the Group holds some 

monetary assets denominated in USD, HKD or EUR subject to certain thresholds stated in its treasury 

mandate, and borrows some loans denominated in USD from time to time. This exposes the Group to 

foreign exchange risk.

There is no other written policy to manage the foreign exchange risk in relation to USD, HKD or EUR as 

management considers that such risk could not be effectively reduced in a low-cost way.

RMB20,956,000 (2011: exchange gains of RMB108,042,000) as a result of RMB appreciation. The 
losses were recorded in “Finance (costs)/income, net” in the consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2012.

At 31 December 2012, if USD, EUR and HKD had strengthened/weakened by 5% (2011: 5%) against 

RMB with all other variables held constant, the profit before income tax for the year would have been 
approximately  RMB221,123,000  lower/higher  (2011:  RMB301,869,000  lower/higher),  mainly  as  a 
result of net foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of net monetary liabilities denominated in 

USD, EUR and HKD.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group, classified as available-

for-sale financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The Group is not exposed to commodity 

price  risk.  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from  the  investments,  the  Group  diversifies  its  portfolio. 

The  investments  made  by  the  Group  are  either  for  the  purpose  of  improving  investment  yield  and 

maintaining high liquidity level simultaneously, or for strategic purpose. Each investment is managed 

by senior management, including the executive directors and with the involvement of non-executive 

directors on a case by case basis.

The available-for-sale financial assets are held for strategic rather than trading purposes. The Group 

does not actively trade these investments.

The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of available-for-sale 

financial assets at the end of the reporting period. If equity prices of the respective instruments held by 

the Group had been 5% (2011: 5%) higher/lower as at 31 December 2012, the other comprehensive 

income would have been approximately RMB272,330,000 (2011: RMB212,909,000) higher/lower.

iii)  Interest rate risk

The Group has interest-bearing assets including receivables in associates and a jointly controlled entity, 

term deposits with initial term of over three months and cash and cash equivalents, details of which 

have been disclosed in Notes 11, 16, 17 and 18.

The  Group’s  interest  rate  risk  arises  from  borrowings  and  long-term  notes  issued  by  the  Group. 

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially 

offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates and long-term notes expose the 

Group to fair value interest rate risk. There is no other written policy on managing the interest rate risk 

and management is to minimise its impact on the income statement.

Other financial assets and liabilities do not have material interest rate risk.

iii)  Interest rate risk (Cont’d)

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  if  the  average  interest  rate  on  variable  interest-bearing 

borrowings had been 5% (2011: 5%) higher/lower, the Group’s profit before income tax for the year 

would have been approximately RMB4,990,000 (2011: RMB3,165,000) lower/higher.

The Company had no variable interest-bearing liabilities.

(b)  Credit risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its cash and deposits (including restricted cash) placed with 

banks and financial institutions, other investments, as well as accounts and other receivables.

The carrying amount of each class of the above financial assets represents the Group’s maximum exposure 

to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

To  manage  this  risk,  deposits  are  mainly  placed  with  state-owned  financial  institutions  in  the  PRC  and 

reputable international financial institutions outside of the PRC. There has been no recent history of default 

in relation to these financial institutions.

For accounts receivable, a large portion of Internet and Mobile Service Fees is derived from the co-operative 

arrangements with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. If the strategic relationship with the 

telecommunications operators is terminated or scaled-back; or if the telecommunications operators alter the 

co-operative arrangements; or if they experience financial difficulties in paying us, the Group’s MVAS and 

IVAS might be adversely affected in terms of recoverability of receivables.

To manage this risk, the Group maintains frequent communication with the telecommunication operators 

to  ensure  the  co-operation  is  effective.  In  view  of  the  history  of  co-operation  with  the  telecommunication 

operators  and  the  sound  collection  history  of  receivables  due  from  them,  management  believes  that  the 

credit risk inherent in the Group’s outstanding accounts receivable balances from these telecommunications 

operators is low (see Note 15 for details).

For  accounts  receivable  from  advertising  customers,  which  are  mainly  advertising  agencies,  the  credit 

quality of each customer is assessed, which takes into account its financial position, past experience and 

other factors. Normally, prepayments representing a certain percentage of the total service fees for  each 

advertising service are required.

Liquidity risk

The  Group  aims  to  maintain  sufficient  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities.  Due  to  the 
dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group’s finance department maintains flexibility in funding 
by  maintaining  adequate  cash  and  cash  equivalent.  For  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  in  order  to 
improve liquidity, the Group also issued long-term notes (see Note 26).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 

structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

In  order  to  maintain  or  adjust  the  capital  structure,  the  Group  may  adjust  the  amount  of  dividends  paid  to 

shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or repurchase the Company’s shares.

The Group monitors capital by regularly reviewing the gearing ratio. The gearing ratio is calculated as total liabilities 

divided by total assets. The total capital is the “total equity” of the Group as shown in the consolidation statement 

of financial position, which is also equal to total assets less total liabilities.

The gearing ratios as at 31 December 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have 

been defined as follows:

• 

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The following table presents the Group’s assets that are measured at fair value as at 31 December 2012:

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on  an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

• 

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end 

of the reporting period, with the resulting value discounted back to present value; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 

definition, seldom equal to the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk 

of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 

addressed below:

(a)  Recognition of revenues and accounts receivable related to IVAS and MVAS

For IVAS and MVAS delivered through the platforms of telecommunication operators, the Internet and Mobile 

Service Fees and the Mobile and Telecom Charges, or the net amount of the two, are confirmed and advised 

by  these  operators  to  the  Group  on  a  monthly  basis.  For  those  Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees  not  yet 

confirmed/advised by the operators at the time of reporting the financial results of the Group, management of 

the Group estimates the amounts receivable based on the historical data.

As  at  31  December  2012,  the  balance  of  accounts  receivable  to  be  confirmed  by  China  Mobile, 

China  Unicom  and  China  Telecom  and  their  branches,  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  was  estimated  to  be 

RMB706,139,000 (2011: RMB746,471,000).

Were the actual outcome to differ by 5% (2011: 5%) from management’s estimates, the Group would need 

to:

• 

reduce  the  revenue  and  accounts  receivable  by  RMB35,307,000  (2011:  RMB37,324,000)  if 

unfavourable; or

• 

increase  the  revenue  and  accounts  receivable  by  RMB35,307,000  (2011:  RMB37,324,000)  if 

favourable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition of share-based compensation expenses

As mentioned in Note 2.26(c), the Group has granted share options to its employees. The directors have 

used the BS Model to determine the total fair value of the options granted, which is to be expensed over the 

vesting  period.  Significant  judgement  on  parameters,  such  as  risk  free  rate,  dividend  yield  and  expected 

volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the BS Model (Note 21).

The fair value of options granted for the year ended 31 December 2012 determined using the BS Model 

was approximately HKD14,572,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB11,902,000) (2011: HKD63,000,000 

(equivalent to approximately RMB52,290,000)).

In  addition,  the  Group  also  granted  awarded  shares  to  its  employees  at  fair  value  of  HKD1,861,663,000 

(equivalent to approximately RMB1,519,969,000) during 2012 (2011: HKD1,157,928,000 (equivalent  to 

approximately RMB957,258,000)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees of share options/awarded shares who 

will stay within the Group at the end of the vesting periods (“Expected Retention Rate of Grantees”) in order 

to determine the amount of share-based compensation expenses charged into the income statement. As at 

31 December 2012, the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees was assessed to be 91% (2011: 91%).

If the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees had been increased/decreased by 5% (2011: 5%), the amount 

of  share-based  compensation  expenses  would  be  increased/decreased  by  RMB64,414,000  (2011: 

RMB65,143,000).

(c)  The estimates of the lifespan of virtual products/items provided in the Group’s Internet platform

As mentioned in Note 2.28(a), the end users purchase certain virtual products/items provided in the Group’s 

Internet  platforms  and  the  relevant  revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  lifespan  of  the  virtual  products/

items. The Group uses the available information, including the historical user pattern and behavior and the 

stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items, to estimate the lifespan of these products/

items.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespan of the virtual products/items (provided and to be 

provided), which may differ from the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the 

revenue being recognised on a different basis than in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.1  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (Cont’d)

(d) 

Income taxes

The  Group  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  numerous  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgement  is  required  in 

determining  the  worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes.  There  are  many  transactions  and  calculations  for 

which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit 

issues  based  on  estimates  of  whether  additional  taxes  will  be  due.  Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these 

matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income 

tax and deferred income tax liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

Were the actual final outcome (on the judgement areas) to differ by 5% from management’s estimates, the 

group would need to:

• 

Increase the income tax liabilities by RMB20,994,000 (2011: RMB35,436,000) and the deferred tax 

liabilities by RMB65,578,000 (2011: RMB46,977,000), if unfavourable; or

• 

Decrease the income tax liabilities by RMB20,994,000 (2011: RMB35,436,000) and the deferred tax 

liabilities by RMB65,578,000 (2011: RMB46,977,000), if favourable.

(e)  Estimation of put option liabilities

The  Group  granted  some  put  options  to  the  non-controlling  interest  owners  that  they  have  the  right  to 

request the Group to repurchase their equity interest in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries when certain 

conditions are met. The repurchase prices were determined by making reference to the revenue or profit 

to be generated by those subsidiaries in future periods. The Group will initially recognise a financial liability 

at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the put option arrangement, and  at  the 

end of each subsequent period, the Group will revisit their estimations. If the Group revises its estimates 

of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised 

estimated  cash  outflows  and  the  adjustments  will  be  recognised  as  income  or  expenses  in  the  income 

statement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

4.2  Critical judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies

Recognition of deferred tax assets

Certain  intra-group  software  and  technology  sales  have  been  transacted  within  the  Group.  The  self-developed 

software and technology purchased by two subsidiary companies, Tencent Computer and Shiji Kaixuan Technology 

Limited  (“Shiji  Kaixuan”),  from  other  group  companies  have  been  initially  recorded  at  the  purchase  prices  as 

costs and then amortised over their contracted useful lives (the “Amortisation”) in their local statutory financial 

statements, while these transactions were eliminated at the group level.

The  Amortisation  has  been  treated  as  a  deductible  expense  in  ascertaining  the  assessable  profits  of  Tencent 

Computer and Shiji Kaixuan for tax reporting purposes while the costs of purchase of these assets were eliminated 

in preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. As a result, deferred tax assets have been 

recognised, based on temporary differences arising from the accounting base (at the group level, which is zero) 

and  the  tax  base  of  the  software  and  technology  involved  in  these  intra-group  transactions,  at  the  respective 

enacted corporate income tax rates of Tencent Computer and Shiji Kaixuan.

As  at  31  December  2012,  the  relevant  deferred  tax  assets  were  approximately  RMB161,589,000  (2011: 

RMB197,010,000) (Note 28), which are expected to be recovered by the tax profits to be generated from Tencent 

Computer and Shiji Kaixuan in future.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s internal 

reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based on these 

reports.

Due to the fact that the scale of e-Commerce transactions business of the Group increased significantly in 2012, the 

executive directors of the Company treated e-Commerce transactions business as a separate segment of the Group’s 

operations. As a result, a new line of segment information has been presented since 1 January 2012. No comparative 

figure of 2011 is presented since the amount involved was insignificant.

The Group has following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011:

– 

– 

– 

– 

– 

IVAS;

MVAS;

Online advertising;

e-Commerce transactions; and

Others.

SEGMENT INFORMATION (Cont’d)

Other segments of the Group mainly comprise of the provision of trademark licensing, software development services 

and software sales.

The  chief  operating  decision-makers  assess  the  performance  of  the  operating  segments  mainly  based  on  segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit/(losses)  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for the operating segments as a whole and therefore they are not 

included in the measure of the segments’ performance which is used by the chief operating decision-makers as a basis 

for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Interest income, other (losses)/gains, 

net, finance (costs)/income, net and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011. The revenues from 

external  customers  reported  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  are  measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that 

applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other information, together with the segment information, provided to the chief operating decision-makers, is measured 

in a manner consistent with that applied in this annual report. There were no segment assets and segment liabilities 

information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

The  segment  information  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  for  the  reportable  segments  for  the  years

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to operating segments. Most of the goodwill is related to 

the operating segment of IVAS.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The management 

calculates fair value less costs to sell based on ratios of EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA (earnings before interest,  tax, 

depreciation and amortisation) of several public comparable companies multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU 

and a discount for the lack of marketability.

The key assumptions used for the calculations of fair value less costs to sell in 2012 are as follows:

EV/EBITDA

Discount for the lack of marketability

2012

6.0-8.0x

25%

The public comparable companies are considered with factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and 

financial risk.

Based  on  the  assessment  made  by  management,  no  provision  for  impairment  on  goodwill  was  necessary  as  at  31 

December 2012.

INVESTMENTS  IN  SUBSIDIARIES,  AMOUNT  DUE  FROM/(TO)  SUBSIDIARIES  AND  A  CONTROLLED 
SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (Cont’d)

(a) 

Investments in subsidiaries (Cont’d)

Note:

(i) 

The amount represents share-based compensation expenses arising from grants of share options and awarded shares of 

the Company to employees of subsidiaries in exchange for their services provided to the subsidiaries, which were deemed 

to be investment made by the Company into these subsidiaries.

(ii) 

All these balances are unsecured and interest-free and their repayments are neither planned nor likely to occur in the 

foreseeable future.

(iii) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these subsidiaries. Nevertheless, under 

certain contractual agreements entered into with the registered owners of these subsidiaries, the Company and its other 

legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their financial and 

operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting the 

majority  of  votes  at  meetings  of  such  authorities.  In  addition,  such  contractual  agreements  also  transfer  the risks  and 

rewards of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as 

consolidating subsidiaries of the Company.

(b)  Amounts due from/(to) subsidiaries

The  amounts  due  from/(to)  subsidiaries  as  at  31  December  2012  represented  current  account  balances 

maintained  by  the  Company  with  certain  subsidiaries.  All  balances  are  unsecured  and  interest-free  and  the 

balances are repayable on demand. As at 31 December 2012, the amounts due from subsidiaries were neither 

past due nor impaired.

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (Cont’d)

(c)  Consolidation of a special purpose entity

In connection with the implementation of the share award scheme of the Group mentioned in Note 21(b),  the 

Company has set up a special purpose entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Special purpose entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares 

acquired for a share award scheme which is set 

up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Scheme

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can 

derive benefits from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the scheme, the 

directors of the Company consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB121,534,000  (2011: 

RMB314,064,000) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.

(d)  Disposal of a subsidiary

In October 2012, the Group entered into an agreement with a third party, a company listed in Shanghai Stock 

Exchange  (the  “Buyer”),  to  sell  all  its  equity  interest  (65.79%)  in  Beijing  Manyougu  Information  Technology  

Company Limited (“Manyougu”) to the  Buyer (“Manyougu Disposal”). Manyougu is a subsidiary of the  Group, 

which is principally engaged in online game development in PRC.

Manyougu  Disposal  is,  among  others,  subject  to  an  approval  by  China  Securities  Regulatory  Committee  (the 

“CSRC”) of the PRC and a successful non-public issuance of the shares of the Buyer for financing the transaction. 

As at 31 December 2012, the Manyougu Disposal had not been approved by the CSRC. Therefore, the Group 

continued to consolidate the financial statements of Manyougu and did not treat Manyougu as a disposal group 

and assets held for sale.

Pursuant to the agreement, the consideration for Manyougu Disposal is determined by certain multiple of the net 

profit to be generated by Manyougu in 2012 and the coming years.

Investments in associates (Cont’d)

Note:

(i) 

In January 2012, the Group acquired 619,400,000 ordinary shares of ChinaVision Media Group Limited (“ChinaVision”), 

representing approximately 8.0% of its then issued share capital, for a cash consideration of HKD247,760,000 (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB201,578,000).  ChinaVision  is  a  company  listed  on  the  main  board  of  the  Stock  Exchange,  and 

is principally engaged in production and licensing of film and television programmes, and printed media and television 

advertising businesses. Since the Group has the right to nominate a director to the board of ChinaVision, ChinaVision is 

accounted for as an associate of the Group.

(ii) 

In April 2012, the Group acquired 3,600,000 preference shares of Kakao Corp. (“Kakao”), a company principally engaged 

in developing and operating mobile messaging applications, representing approximately 13.8% of its then issued share 

capital,  for  a  cash  consideration  of  KRW72,000,000,000  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB401,053,000).  Since  the 

Group has significant influence in Kakao through its representative in the board of directors, Kakao is accounted for as an 

associate of the Group.

(iii) 

In July 2012, the Group acquired certain equity shares of Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic Games”), representing approximately 

48.4%  of  its  then  issued  share  capital,  for  a  cash  consideration  of  USD330,000,000  (equivalent  to  approximately 

RMB2,087,217,000).  Epic  Games  is  a  US  incorporated  company  principally  engaged  in  developing  game  engine 

technology, as well as game titles for personal computers, consoles and mobile devices. Since the Group has the right to 

nominate directors to the board of Epic Games, Epic Games is accounted for as an associate of the Group.

(iv) 

In addition to the above, the Group acquired some other associates or made additional investments in existing associates 

for  an  aggregate  consideration  of  RMB280,010,000  during  the  year  ended  31  December 2012.  They  are  principally 

engaged in provision of online community services, online game development and other Internet-related businesses.

(v) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  the  Group  made  impairment  provision  of  RMB194,859,000  (2011: 

RMB71,177,000) for investments in associates based on the assessment with reference to business performance and 

recoverable value of associates.

Note:

Although the Group holds less than 20% equity interest in these investees, the Group treated them as associates because the 

Group is able to exercise its significant influence on these investees through its representatives on their respective boards of 

directors.

(b) 

Investments in redeemable preference shares of associates

The Group held certain redeemable preference shares of the associates, which are principally engaged in online community 

services,  online  game  development  and  other  Internet-related  businesses.  The  redemption  prices  of  the  relevant  shares  are 

agreed at not less than their original subscription prices.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  the  Group  also  made  impairment  provision  of  RMB449,431,000  (2011: 

RMB94,000,000)  for  the  investments  in  redeemable  preference  shares  of  certain  associates  based  on  the  assessment  with 

reference to business performance and recoverable value of associates.

INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES (Cont’d)

Note: (Cont’d)

(c) 

Loans to associates

As at 31 December 2012, the carrying amount of the loans to associates of the Group amounted to RMB161,927,000 (2011: 

RMB95,299,000). The aggregate principal amount of the loans to associates is RMB159,993,000, which is required to be repaid 

in 2 years (2011: RMB92,631,000). These loans bear interest rates of 4.0% to 6.0% or are interest-free.

The Group presented the loans to its associates as a component of “Interests in associates” in 2012. The comparative figures 

have also been reclassified to conform to the presentation. Such reclassification has no impact on the Group’s net profit for the 

comparative year, as well as net assets of the Group as at 31 December 2011.

(d) 

Transactions with associates

During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group entered into cooperation agreements with certain associates, pursuant 

to which the associates operate their games/applications on the Group’s Internet platforms, which are available to the users of 

the Group. The Group pays the associates a pre-determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from end users for the 

virtual products/items utilised in their games/applications. In the whole arrangement, the Group acts as an agent and recognises 

the related revenue on a net basis. In 2012, the revenue recorded by the Group from the above cooperation with associates was 

not material.

As at 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Group was entitled to certain call options and conversion options associated with 

its interests in associates. The directors of the Company considered that the fair values of such options were insignificant 

and accordingly, the Group did not separately recognise these options in the consolidated financial statements.

value as at 31 December 2012.

20  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(i) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(ii) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with limited liabilities in the PRC, appropriation of net profits (after offsetting accumulated losses from prior years) should be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profits (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Funds. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With approvals obtained from their respective boards of directors of these companies, the Reserve Fund can be used to offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(iii) 

This share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by non-wholly 

owned subsidiaries (Note 21(d)).

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted four share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II and Post-IPO Option Scheme III, under which the directors may, at their 

discretion, grant options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms 

and conditions stipulated therein. No further options will be granted under the Pre-IPO Option Scheme and the 

Post-IPO Option Scheme I.

In respect of Post-IPO Option Scheme II and Post-IPO Option Scheme III, the exercise price must be at least the 

higher of: (i) the closing price of the Company’s shares as stated in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheet on 

the date of grant, which must be a business day; (ii) the average closing price of the Company’s shares as stated 

in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheets for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; 

and (iii) the nominal value of the Company’s shares. In addition, the option vesting period is determined by the 

Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year or 10-year period after the date of grant of option.

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(a)  Share option schemes (Cont’d)

(3)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the BS Model to determine the fair value of the options granted, 

which is to be expensed over the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 

the year ended 31 December 2012 was HKD87.89 per option (equivalent to approximately RMB71.78 per 

option) (2011: HKD81.69 per option (equivalent to approximately RMB67.81 per option)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgement on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the BS Model, 

which are summarised as below:

Weighted average share price at the grant date

HKD248.80

1.35%-2.31%

0.36%

48.1% 49.10%-49.90%

The expected volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is determined based on the 

average daily trading price volatility of the shares of the Company.

The outstanding share options as of 31 December 2012 were divided into two or five tranches on an equal 

basis as at their grant date. The first tranche can be exercised after a specified period ranging from one to 

five years from the grant date, and then the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(b)  Share award scheme

The  Company  has  adopted  a  share  award  scheme  (the  “Share  Award  Scheme”),  which  is  managed  by  an 

independent  trustee  appointed  by  the  Group  (the  “Trustee”).  The  vesting  period  of  the  awarded  share  is 

determined by the Board.

(b)  Share award scheme (Cont’d)

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2012  was 

HKD245.95  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB200.81  per  share)  (2011:  HKD193.14  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB159.67 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2012 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant date. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from six 

months to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(c)  Employee incentive scheme

In 2011, the Group established an employee incentive scheme in a form of limited liability partnership (the “EIS”) 

for incentive purpose pursuant to a shareholders’ resolution passed at the 2011 annual general meeting of the 

Company held on 11 May 2011. The Board may, at its absolute discretion, select any employees of the Group to 

participate in the EIS by subscribing for partnership interest at cash consideration. The total cash contribution by 

selected employees is limited to approximately RMB80,000,000. The participating employees are entitled to all 

the economic benefits generated by the EIS (if any) after a specified vesting period under the EIS, ranging from 4 

to 7 years. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which acts as a general partner of the EIS manages and in 

essence, controls it. The EIS is therefore consolidated by the Company. In addition, because certain continuous 

service conditions are attached to the partnership interest subscribed by the employees, the EIS is accounted for 

as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the expenses of which for the years ended 31 December 

2012 and 2011 were considered not material to the Group by the directors of the Company.

(d)  Share options and restricted share award scheme adopted by non-wholly owned subsidiaries

Other  than  the  above,  certain  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  operate  their  own  share-based 

compensation  plans  (share  option  and/or  restricted  share  award  schemes).  Their  exercise  prices  of  the  share 

options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and awarded shares are determined by the board of 

directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion. Similar to the share option/award schemes adopted by the 

Company,  the  share  options  or  restricted  shares  of  the  subsidiaries  so  granted  are  normally  vested  by  several 

tranches.

The  directors  of  the  Company  considered  that  the  fair  value  of  share  options/restricted  shares  granted  under 

the  share-based  compensation  plans  of  the  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  and  the  relevant  share-based 

compensation  expense  charged  into  the  consolidated  income  statement  of  the  Group  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2012, are not significant to the Group.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of vesting periods of the options and awarded shares (the “Expected Retention Rate”) in order to determine the 

amount of share-based compensation expenses charged to the income statement. As at 31 December 2012, the 

Expected Retention Rate was assessed to be 91% (31 December 2011: 91%).

Note:

The  deferred  tax  assets  recognised  are  mainly  related  to  the  temporary  differences  arising  from  certain  intra-group  software  and 

technology transfer transactions (Note 4.2). The credit to income statement represents tax impacts of originating temporary differences 

arising from these software and technology transfer, while the charge to income statement represents tax impacts of the reversal of the 

temporary differences as a result of the amortisation of the costs of these software and technology.

As  at  31  December  2012,  the  Group  did  not  recognise  deferred  income  tax  assets  of  RMB250,929,000  (2011: 

RMB347,355,000) in respect of cumulative tax losses amounting to RMB909,558,000 (2011: RMB1,102,264,000). 

These tax losses will expire from 2013 to 2017.

37  TAX EXPENSE

(a) 

Income tax

(i) 

Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands profits tax

The Group was not subject to any taxation in these jurisdictions for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 

2011.

(ii)  Hong Kong profits tax

Hong Kong profits tax provision has been provided at the rate of 16.5% on the estimated assessable profits 

for the year ended 31 December 2012. No such provision was made for the year ended 31 December 2011.

(iii)  PRC Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”)

CIT provision was made on the estimated assessable profits of entities within the Group incorporated in the 

PRC, calculated in accordance with the relevant regulations of the PRC after considering the available tax 

benefits from refunds and allowances.

Pursuant  to  the  PRC  Corporate  Income  Tax  Law  passed  by  the  Tenth  National  People’s  Congress  on  16 

March 2007 (the “CIT Law”), the CIT rate for domestic and foreign enterprises has been unified at 25%, 

effective from 1 January 2008.

The CIT Law also provides a five-year transitional period starting from its effective date for those enterprises 

which were established before the promulgation of the CIT Law and which were entitled to preferential CIT 

rates under the then effective tax laws or regulations.

On  26  December  2007,  the  State  Council  issued  the  “Circular  to  Implementation  of  the  Transitional 

Preferential Policies for the Corporate Income Tax”. Pursuant to this circular, the transitional CIT rates for 

the Group’s subsidiaries established in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone or the Beijing High Technology 

Zone before 16 March 2007 are 18%, 20%, 22%, 24% and 25% for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, 

respectively. Other tax preferential treatments such as reduction of 50% in CIT rates shall be based on the 

above transitional CIT rates for the respective years.

In  2011,  certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  in  the  PRC  were  approved  as  High  and  New  Technology 

Enterprise, and accordingly, they were subject to a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15% for a 3-year period 

from 2011 to 2013 according to the applicable CIT Law. Moreover, one of these subsidiaries was further 

approved as a national key software enterprise, and accordingly, its CIT rates in 2011 and 2012 were further 

reduced to 10%.

(a) 

Income tax (Cont’d)

(iii)  PRC Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) (Cont’d)

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Group are exempt from CIT for two years, followed by a 50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the 

next three years, commencing either from the first year of commercial operations or from the first year of 

profitable operation after offsetting tax losses generated from prior years.

(iv)  United States corporate income tax

United States corporate income tax provision was provided during the year ended 31 December 2012 for the 

entities within the Group which were incorporated in the United States with estimated assessable profits, at 

applicable tax rate of 36%. No such provision was provided for the year ended 31 December 2011.

(v)  Corporate income tax in other countries

Corporate income tax provision has been provided for the year ended 31 December 2012 for the entities 

within the Group which were incorporated in Europe, East Asia and South America to the extent that there 

were estimated assessable profits under these jurisdictions, at applicable tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 

35%. No such provision was made for the year ended 31 December 2011.

(vi)  PRC withholding tax

According to applicable PRC tax regulations, dividends distributed by a company established in the PRC 

to  a  foreign  investor  with  respect  to  profits  derived  after  1  January  2008  are  generally  subject  to  a  10% 

withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong and meets the conditions or requirements 

under  the  double  taxation  arrangement  entered  into  between  the  Mainland  China  and  Hong  Kong,  the 

relevant withholding tax rate will be reduced from 10% to 5%. Hence, the Group used 5% to accrue the 

withholding  tax  for  certain  Hong  Kong  intermediate  holding  companies  which  are  expected  to  fulfill  the 

aforesaid conditions.

this regard, some subsidiaries of the Group have been transformed from BT payers to VAT payers in 2012, and the applicable tax 

rate is 3-6%.

38  PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY

The profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 is dealt with in the 

financial statements of the Company to the extent of RMB3,263,692,000 (2011: RMB1,279,795,000).

39  EARNINGS PER SHARE

(a)  Basic

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 

by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. During the year ended 31 December 2012, these 

share options and restricted shares either had anti-dilutive effect or  their dilutive effect was insignificant to the 

Group.

The dividends paid in 2012 amounted to RMB1,107,889,000 (2011: RMB838,290,000), which excluded the dividends 

of RMB10,684,000 (2011: RMB6,720,000) related to the shares held by the Share Scheme Trust for the purposes of 

the Share Award Scheme.

A final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 of HKD1.00 per share (2011: HKD0.75 per share) 

was  proposed  pursuant  to  a  resolution  passed  by  the  Board  on  20  March  2013  and  subject  to  the  approval  of  the 

shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held on 15 May 2013. The consolidated financial statements do not 

reflect this dividends payable.

41  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(a)  The Level Up! Acquisition

Pursuant  to  an  agreement  dated  19  January  2012,  in  July  2012,  the  Group  acquired  49%  equity  interest 
in  Level  Up!  International  Holdings  Pte.  Ltd.  (“Level  Up!”),  a  publisher  and  operator  of  online  games,  from 
MIH  LatAm  Holdings  B.V.  (the  “Vendor”)  at  a  consideration  of  USD26,950,000  (equivalent  to  approximately 
RMB170,456,000) (the “Level Up! Acquisition”). The Level Up! Acquisition aligns well with the Company’s long 
term strategy to cooperate with leading local Internet companies in emerging markets through strategic investment 
and partnership. According to the terms of the Level Up! Acquisition, the Group also has a currently exercisable 
call option to acquire additional 18% equity interest (total 67% equity interest together with the aforesaid 49% 
interest) in Level Up! at a consideration of USD9,900,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB62,615,000) and its 
relevant interest accrued from the closing date of Level Up! Acquisition to the date of the exercise of the option. 
Upon  completion  of  the  Level  Up!  Acquisition,  Level  Up!  was  accounted  for  as  a  subsidiary  of  the  Group.  The 
Vendor is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Naspers Limited, which is the ultimate substantial shareholder 
of  the  Company.  Therefore,  the  Level  Up!  Acquisition  was  a  related  parties  transaction.  In  addition,  the  Level 
Up! Acquisition was also a connected transaction under the Chapter 14A of the Rules Governing the Listing of 
Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.

Goodwill of RMB133,928,000 was recognised as a result of the Level Up! Acquisition based on the finalisation of 
its fair value assessment. It was mainly attributable to the operating synergies and economies of scale expected to 
be derived from combining operations of the Group and Level Up!. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to 
be deductible for income tax purposes.

The Group chose to record the non-controlling equity interests in Level Up! at fair value on the closing date of Level 
Up! Acquisition, which was estimated by making reference to the purchase price paid for the acquisition.  The 
following table summarises the consideration paid for the acquisition and the fair value of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed or recognised as at the closing date of the transaction.

(a)  The Level Up! Acquisition (Cont’d)

Note:

The acquisition-related costs were included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the 

year ended 31 December 2012.

The revenues and net profit contributed by Level Up! from 1 January 2012 or its acquisition date to 31 December 

2012 were not material to the Group.

(b)  Acquisitions of equity interests in five companies

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2012,  the  Group  acquired  the  entire  equity  interests  in  two  companies. 

One of them is engaged in providing massively multi-players online game information and the other is engaged in 

developing utility programs on mobile device. In addition, the Group acquired 51% equity interest in a company 

engaged in book publication and online reading services.

The Group acquired certain additional interest in an associate engaged in e-Commerce business and held 58% 

equity interest in this company after the acquisition. The Group also acquired additional 60% equity interest in 

another associate engaged in developing mobile browser and held the entire equity interest in this company after 

the acquisition. The deemed disposal gains/(losses) derived from these step-up business combinations were not 

significant.

The considerations and the allocation of such considerations to the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 

and goodwill recognised as at the respective dates of these acquisitions are as follows:

Cash consideration paid

Fair value of the interests previously held by the Group

Fair value of the non-controlling interests
