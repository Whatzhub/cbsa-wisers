BUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Strategic Progress and Outlook

2021  was  a  challenging  year,  in  which  we  embraced  changes  and  implemented  certain  measures  that  reinforced  the 

Company’s  long-term  sustainability,  but  had  the  effect  of  slowing  our  revenue  growth.  Despite  financial  headwinds,  we 

continued  to  make  strategic  headway,  including  driving  widespread  adoption  of  our  enterprise  software  and  productivity 

tools, increasing content creation and consumption in our Video Accounts, and expanding our International Games business. 

We believe the China Internet industry is structurally shifting to a healthier mode characterised by a re-focus on user value, 

technology  innovation,  and  social  responsibility.  We  are  proactively  adapting  to  the  new  environment  by  managing  costs, 

increasing  efficiency,  sharpening  our  focus  on  key  strategic  areas,  and  repositioning  ourselves  for  sustainable  long-term 

growth. Below are some highlights from our key products and business lines during the reporting quarter:

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Chairman’s Statement

Communication and Social

Weixin Video Accounts’ time spent per user and total video views more than doubled year-on-year as we enriched content 

diversity  and  enhanced  our  product  experience.  Video  Accounts  Live  Streaming  achieved  significant  breakthroughs  in 

user  reach  and  engagement,  exclusively  hosting  popular  boy  band  Westlife’s  first-ever  online  concert,  which  drew  27 

million viewers. While our current focus is primarily on user engagement, we believe Video Accounts will provide significant 

monetisation opportunities, including short video feeds advertisements, live streaming tipping and live streaming eCommerce. 

Weixin Mini Programs facilitated independent merchants to thrive within their own private domains, with their physical goods 

GMV doubling in 2021. Our Health Code has served 1.3 billion users making 180 billion visits, becoming the most-used ePass 

for verifying health and travel status during the pandemic.

QQ  integrated  Unreal  Engine’s  graphics  capabilities  to  enable  real-time  rendering  and  physics  simulation,  providing  more 

attractive visuals and lifelike interactions for users. We are testing an application of Unreal Engine in Super QQ Show, which 

allows users to customise and dress up their 3D virtual avatars, for use in various social scenarios.

Digital Content

Our fee-based VAS subscriptions grew 8% year-on-year to 236 million. Tencent Video increased its subscription counts 1% 

year-on-year to 124 million, and cemented its number one position in China with diversified content across animated series, 

drama series and sports. In view of the latest market conditions, we are implementing a cost optimisation process to reduce 

financial losses at Tencent Video while maintaining its leading position. For music, we grew subscription counts 36% year-on-

year to 76 million, benefitting from expanded sales channels and high-quality content and services.

Domestic Games

We are cultivating our key IP franchises more deeply and broadly. For example, we are developing new games, animated series 

and a movie based on Honour of Kings’ characters. We provided events tied into the Winter Olympics in Peacekeeper Elite, QQ 

Speed Mobile and QQ Dancer Mobile, delivering lifelike sports experience across multiple genres.

Our industry-leading efforts in restricting time spent and spending by Minors yielded effective results. In the fourth quarter of 

2021, total time spent by Minors reduced by 88% year-on-year, and contributed 0.9% of the total time spent on our Domestic 

Games. Total grossing receipts from Minors reduced by 73% year-on-year, and contributed 1.5% of the total grossing receipts 

of our Domestic Games.

Looking ahead, we expect to fully digest the impact of Minor protection measures in the second half of 2022. We believe we 

will benefit from more new game launches when there are new releases of Banhao.

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Chairman’s Statement

International Games

We  achieved  notable  progress  across  different  platforms  and  genres.  Among  international  mobile  games,  we  developed 

and  operate  5  out  of  the  top  10  titles  measured  by  DAU.  League  of  Legends’  animated  series,  Arcane,  topped  Netflix’s 

English-language TV series viewership chart during the week following its release. League of Legends World Championship 

consolidated  its  leadership  as  the  world’s  most  popular  eSports  tournament,  attracting  a  record-high  of  approximately  74 

million peak concurrent viewers for its Finals. Clash Royale released one of the biggest updates in its history, boosting daily 

active users and grossing receipts. We launched our global game publishing brand, Level Infinite, to support our studios and 

partners in delivering games to international gamers.

Going  forward,  we  aim  to  grow  further  our  existing  titles  via  deepening  market  penetration,  product  enhancements  and 

operational  optimisation.  In  addition,  we  will  continue  to  release  new  titles,  which  we  expect  to  drive  additional  growth, 

particularly for 2023 and beyond.

Online Advertising

We  continued  to  enhance  our  differentiated  advertising  solutions,  while  adapting  to  regulatory  changes  and  the  evolving 

macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Weixin’s daily active advertisers expanded by over 30% year-

on-year. Over one-third of Moments’ advertising revenue was generated from advertisements using Mini Programs as landing 

pages  and  advertisements  connecting  users  to  customer  service  representatives  via  WeCom.  We  expect  our  advertising 

business to resume growth in late 2022, as we adapt to the new environment and further upgrade our advertising solutions.

FinTech

We  strengthened  our  payment  ecosystem  by  enhancing  user  security,  upgrading  transaction  and  customer  management 

functions for SMEs, as well as reducing merchants’ transaction friction via tools such as Weixin Pay Score. We now support 

e-CNY as an additional funding option within Weixin Pay, as part of the PBOC’s e-CNY pilot phase.

Cloud and Other Business Services

For  communication  and  collaboration  SaaS,  we  upgraded  the  integration  among  WeCom,  Tencent  Meeting  and  Tencent 

Docs to provide enhanced solutions for enterprises. We also enabled differentiated CRM functions in WeCom via deepened 

connection  with  Weixin.  While  we  are  currently  prioritising  scale  expansion  before  significant  revenue  generation,  the 

monetisation success of critical enterprise SaaS such as CRM software in international markets, as well as the significant size 

and fast growth of domestic PaaS spending, validate the monetisation potential of critical enterprise SaaS in China.

In view of the changes in market environment, we are repositioning our focus for IaaS and PaaS from revenue growth at all 

costs to customer value creation and quality of growth. We believe that the change in focus will benefit our customers, as well 

as our margins, over the longer term.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives

We are committed to harnessing technology to build a sustainable future for our consumers, enterprises, and society at large.

Environment

We announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations and supply chain, and to use green power 

for 100% of all electricity consumed by 2030. In our inaugural Tencent Carbon Neutrality Target and Roadmap Report, we 

outlined key approaches in reaching the net zero goal for scopes 1, 2 and 3. We will improve our power efficiency through 

technology  innovations,  increase  our  usage  of  renewable  energy,  actively  participate  in  green  power  trading,  and  explore 

investments  in  renewable  energy  projects.  We  joined  the  Science-Based  Carbon  Targets  initiative  (SBTi)  to  facilitate  the 

transition to a zero-carbon operation.

Social

In  2021,  we  established  the  Sustainable  Social  Value  (SSV)  Organisation  and  announced  our  commitment  to  common 

prosperity initiatives. We upgraded our charitable fundraising platform, extending the reach of our annual “99 Giving Day” to 

engage 69 million donations and 12,000 enterprises. Leveraging Internet of Things solutions and Weixin Mini Programs, we 

built a public emergency response platform which connects emergency control centres with volunteers and locates nearby 

Automated  External  Defibrillator  equipment  for  offering  first  aid.  We  adapted  many  of  our  apps  to  provide  elderly-oriented 

and barrier-free services for senior citizens. We set up dedicated funds to support basic scientific research, as well as critical 

healthcare and environmental technologies.

Governance

Supplementing  risk  management  and  internal  control  policies  we  already  have  in  place,  we  enhanced  our  internal  anti-

trust compliance system in 2021, including establishing a dedicated compliance department, updating guidelines for all our 

businesses, and strengthening staff training. We also updated our policies on anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance 

to  closely  follow  domestic  and  global  regulatory  requirements  and  trends.  Our  corporate  culture  supports  diversity  and 

inclusion. We collaborated with the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) to produce videos and articles promoting 

women leadership in the technology industry.

DIVIDENDS

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD1.60 per share (2020: HKD1.60 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2021, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Such proposed dividend will be 

payable on 6 June 2022 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 25 May 

2022.

On 23 December  2021, the Board resolved to declare a special interim dividend  in the  form of a distribution  in specie of 

approximately 457 million Class A ordinary shares of JD.com indirectly held by the Company to the shareholders whose names 

appeared on the register of members of the Company on 25 January 2022 in proportion to their then respective shareholdings 

in  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  1  Class  A  ordinary  share  of  JD.com  for  every  21  Shares  held  by  the  shareholders,  being 

rounded down to the nearest whole number of Class A ordinary shares of JD.com.

APPRECIATION

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like  to  thank  wholeheartedly  our  staff  and  management  team  for  their  dedication  and 

professionalism, which have been the cornerstone of the Group’s sustainable development. Further, I would like to extend our 

gratitude to all our shareholders and stakeholders for their continuous support and trust. We will continue to adhere to our 

strategy of promoting sustainable innovations for social value, alongside nurturing the consumer Internet and embracing the 

industrial Internet, and contribute more to the common good and value of our society.

Revenues from VAS1 increased by 10% to RMB291.6 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021 on a  year-on-

year basis. Domestic Games revenues grew by 6% to RMB128.8 billion, driven by games including Honour of Kings, 

Call of Duty Mobile and Moonlight Blade Mobile, partly offset by a decrease in revenues from DnF and Peacekeeper 

Elite.  We  implemented  a  comprehensive  set  of  measures  for  the  protection  of  Minors  within  our  Domestic  Games, 

which  impacted  revenue  growth  directly  (less  spending  by  Minors)  and  indirectly  (developer  resources  focused  on 

implementation  of  new  measures).  International  Games  revenues  grew  by  31%  to  RMB45.5  billion,  due  to  robust 

performance of games including PUBG Mobile, Valorant, Brawl Stars and Clash of Clans. Social Networks revenues 

increased by 8% to RMB117.3 billion, driven by our Video Accounts live streaming service, video subscription service, 

and contribution from consolidation of HUYA since April 2020.

From the third quarter of 2021, we disclose revenues from Domestic Games and International Games as new sub-segments under 

VAS,  reflecting  the  increasing  scale  of  our  International  Games  business.  Mobile  games  VAS  revenues  (including  mobile  games 

revenues attributable to our Social Networks business) increased by 12% year-on-year to RMB164.8 billion, while PC client games 

revenues grew by 2% year-on-year to RMB45.3 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021.

–  

Revenues from Online Advertising increased by 8% to RMB88.6 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021 on a 

year-on-year basis, with strong growth witnessed in the early half of the year, followed by significant slowdown and then 

decline in the latter half of the year as our advertisers and our own advertising services adapted to the new economic 

and regulatory environment, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. Online Advertising full year revenue growth 

reflected the relative resilience of the consumer staples category, as  well  as consolidation of Bitauto’s  and Sogou’s 

advertising revenues, partly offset by headwinds from regulatory changes in advertiser categories including education, 

property and insurance, as well as by regulatory measures on the online advertising industry itself, such as limitations 

on launch screen advertisements. Social and Others Advertising revenues grew by 11% to RMB75.3 billion, driven by 

increased advertiser demand for Weixin properties. Media Advertising revenues decreased by 7% to RMB13.3 billion, 

mainly due to lower advertising revenues from our media platforms including Tencent News and Tencent Video amid 

the challenging macro environment and delays to content launches.

–  

Revenues  from  FinTech  and  Business  Services  increased  by  34%  to  RMB172.2  billion  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2021 on a year-on-year basis. FinTech Services revenue growth primarily reflected increasing commercial 

payment  volume.  Business  Services  revenues  increased  rapidly  year-on-year,  due  to  digitalisation  of  traditional 

industries and videolisation of the Internet industry, as well as consolidation of Bitauto’s Business Services revenue 

since November 2020.

Cost of revenues.  Cost  of  revenues  increased  by  21%  to  RMB314.2  billion  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  on  a 

year-on-year basis, primarily driven by transaction costs to handle increased payment-related transaction volumes, content 

and infrastructure investments, cloud project deployment costs, as well as channel and distribution costs. As a percentage 

of  revenues,  cost  of  revenues  increased  to  56%  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  from  54%  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2020, reflecting our continuous investment in key strategic areas, as well as a revenue mix shift toward currently 

lower gross margin activities. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of business for the years ended 31

Cost  of  revenues  for  Online  Advertising  increased  by  20%  year-on-year  to  RMB48.1  billion  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2021, driven by increased server and bandwidth costs including those associated with our Video Accounts 

service, as well as increased content costs, primarily for our Tencent Video and Tencent Sports services.

–  

Cost  of  revenues  for  FinTech  and  Business  Services  increased  by  32%  year-on-year  to  RMB120.8  billion  for  the 

year ended 31 December 2021, reflecting increased transaction costs due to payment volume growth, as well as our 

continuous investment in cloud computing talent and operations.

Other gains, net.  We  recorded  net  other  gains  of  RMB149.5  billion  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  which  were 

primarily non-IFRS adjustment items such as net gains on deemed disposals and disposals of certain investee companies 

(including  a  RMB78.2  billion  gain  from  deemed  disposal  of  JD.com),  and  net  fair  value  gains  from  revaluation  of  certain 

investee  companies,  partly  offset  by  impairment  provisions  against  certain  investee  companies  reflecting  revisions  of  their 

financial outlooks and changes in their business environments.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 20% to RMB40.6 billion for the year ended 31 

December 2021 on a year-on-year basis, reflecting greater marketing spending on games and Business Services, including 

those associated with the consolidation of recently acquired subsidiaries. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing 

expenses was 7% for the year ended 31 December 2021, broadly stable compared to the year ended 31 December 2020.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 33% to RMB89.8 billion for the year 

ended 31 December 2021 on a year-on-year basis, mainly driven by increased R&D expenses and staff costs, including higher 

share-based compensation expenses, reflecting unusually intense competition for talent in 2020 and 2021, which we expect to 

moderate in 2022. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 16% for the year ended 31 

December 2021 from 14% for the year ended 31 December 2020.

Finance costs, net.  Net  finance  costs  decreased  by  10%  to  RMB7.1  billion  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  on  a 

year-on-year  basis,  primarily  due  to  net  exchange  gains  recognised  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  compared  to 

net exchange losses for the year ended 31 December 2020, partly offset by the increase in interest expenses as a result of 

increased indebtedness.

Share of loss/profit of associates and joint ventures, net.  We  recorded  share  of  losses  of  associates  and  joint  ventures  of 

RMB16.4 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021, compared to share of profits of RMB3.7 billion for the year ended 

31 December 2020. Non-IFRS share of losses of associates and joint ventures were RMB1.0 billion for the year ended 31 

December 2021, compared to non-IFRS share of profits of RMB6.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020, reflecting 

increased investments in community retail initiatives by certain associates, and losses recognised from an associate in the 

transportation services vertical.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 2% to RMB20.3 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021 on a

Revenues  from  VAS2  increased  by  7%  to  RMB71.9  billion  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  on  a  year-on-year  basis. 

Domestic Games revenues grew by 1% to RMB29.6 billion, driven by games including Honour of Kings, as well as 

recently launched titles such as Fight of The Golden Spatula and League of Legends: Wild Rift, partly offset by the 

decrease in revenues from Moonlight Blade Mobile and Peacekeeper Elite. International Games revenues grew by 34% 

to RMB13.2 billion, reflecting new content for Valorant and Clash Royale, a true-up adjustment to revenue of Supercell 

upon periodic review of our revenue deferral periods, and consolidation of Digital Extremes. Social Networks revenues 

grew by 4% to RMB29.1 billion, driven by our Video Accounts live streaming service, video and music subscription 

services.

–  

Revenues from Online Advertising decreased by 13% to RMB21.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-

on-year basis. The year-on-year decrease in Online Advertising revenues reflected weakness in advertiser categories 

including education, games and Internet services, partly offset by the consolidation of Sogou’s advertising revenue. 

Social  and  Others  Advertising  revenues  decreased  by  10%  to  RMB18.3  billion,  primarily  due  to  lower  advertising 

revenues from our mobile advertising network and Weixin Moments. Media Advertising revenues decreased by 25% to 

RMB3.2 billion, reflecting lower advertising revenues from Tencent Video and Tencent News services.

–  

Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 25% to RMB48.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 

on a year-on-year basis. FinTech Services revenue growth mainly reflected increasing commercial payment volume. 

Business Services revenue growth was primarily driven by increased use of our services by Internet services, public 

transportation and retail industries.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 15% to RMB86.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year 

basis,  driven  by  transaction  costs  to  handle  increased  payment-related  transaction  volumes,  cloud  project  deployment 

costs, server and bandwidth costs, as well as content costs, partly offset by decreased channel and distribution costs. As a 

percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 60% for the fourth quarter of 2021 from 56% for the fourth quarter of 

2020, reflecting costs growing faster than revenues in certain businesses and our continued investment in key strategic areas.

Cost  of  revenues  for  FinTech  and  Business  Services  increased  by  27%  to  RMB34.9  billion  for  the  fourth  quarter 

of  2021  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  reflecting  increased  transaction  costs  due  to  payment  volume  growth,  and  our 

continuous investment in cloud computing talent and operations.

Other gains, net. We recorded net other gains of RMB86.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, which were primarily non-IFRS 

adjustment items such as net gains on deemed disposals and disposals of certain investee companies (including a RMB78.0 

billion gain arising from the cessation of JD.com as an associate, due to the resignation of our board representative).

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 16% to RMB11.6 billion for the fourth quarter 

of 2021 on a year-on-year basis, reflecting increased marketing spending on games partly offset by decreased spending on 

digital content services. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expenses was 8% for the fourth quarter of 2021, 

broadly stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

General and administrative expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  23%  to  RMB24.4  billion  for  the 

fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year basis, mainly driven by increased R&D expenses and staff costs, including higher 

share-based compensation expenses, reflecting unusually intense competition for talent in 2020 and 2021, which we expect to 

moderate in 2022. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 17% for the fourth quarter 

of 2021 from 15% for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Finance costs, net. Net finance costs decreased by 17% to RMB1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year 

basis, primarily due to foreign exchange gains recognised this quarter compared to losses for the fourth quarter of 2020, partly 

offset by the increase in interest expenses as a result of increased indebtedness.

Share of loss/profit of associates and joint ventures, net.  We  recorded  share  of  losses  of  associates  and  joint  ventures  of 

RMB8.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to share of profits of RMB1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020. 

Non-IFRS share of losses of associates and joint ventures were RMB0.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 

non-IFRS share of profits of RMB2.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting increased investments in community retail 

initiatives by certain associates, and losses recognised from an associate in the transportation services vertical.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 5% to RMB3.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year 

basis.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 60% to 

RMB95.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year basis. Non-IFRS profit attributable to equity holders of the 

Company decreased by 25% to RMB24.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 as costs and expenses generally increased 

faster than revenues, and as net associate contributions moved from profits to losses, for the reasons cited above.

Revenues. Revenues increased by 1% to RMB144.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

–  

Revenues from VAS decreased by 4% to RMB71.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Domestic Games revenues 

decreased by 12% to RMB29.6 billion due to lower revenues from several of our existing games reflecting seasonally 

lower revenues in the fourth quarter as well as additional measures implemented in the quarter for the protection of 

Minors. This weakness was partly offset by revenue contributions from recently launched titles including League of 

Legends: Wild Rift and Fight of The Golden Spatula. International Games revenues increased by 16% to RMB13.2 

billion, reflecting revenue growth from games such as Valorant, Brawl Stars, and Clash Royale, as well as a true-up 

adjustment to revenue of Supercell upon periodic review of our revenue deferral periods. Social Networks revenues 

decreased by 4% to RMB29.1 billion, due to the decrease in revenues from in-game item sales, partly offset by revenue 

growth from our Video Accounts live streaming service.

–  

Revenues from Online Advertising decreased by 4% to RMB21.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting a 

slower-than-usual  seasonal  spending  upturn  in  advertiser  categories  such  as  eCommerce  and  consumer  staples, 

as  well  as  weakness  in  categories  such  as  Internet  services,  education,  and  games.  Social  and  Others  Advertising 

revenues decreased by 4% to RMB18.3 billion, reflecting lower advertising revenues from Weixin and QQ properties, 

as  well  as  our  mobile  advertising  network,  partly  offset  by  the  consolidation  of  Sogou’s  advertising  revenue.  Media 

Advertising revenues decreased by 8% to RMB3.2 billion, primarily due to lower advertising revenues from the Tencent 

Video service.

–  

Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 11% to RMB48.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021,

–  

Cost of revenues for FinTech and Business Services increased by 13% to RMB34.9 billion for the fourth quarter of

cloud project deployments, as well as increased transaction costs due to payment volume growth.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 11% to RMB11.6 billion for the fourth quarter 

of 2021 on a quarter-on-quarter basis, due to increased marketing spending related to games (including expenses associated 

with the global launch of the Arcane animated series), and Business Services, partly offset by decreased spending on user 

acquisition for non-core areas.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 2% to RMB24.4 billion for the fourth 

quarter of 2021 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

Share of losses of associates and joint ventures, net. We recorded share of losses of associates and joint ventures of RMB8.3

NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-IFRS financial 

measures (in terms of operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, net margin, profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS) have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-IFRS financial 

measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared 

in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-IFRS financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by 

other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-IFRS  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  Group’s  core  operations  by  excluding  certain  non-cash  items  and  certain 

impact of M&A transactions. In addition, non-IFRS adjustments include relevant non-IFRS adjustments for the Group’s major 

associates  based  on  available  published  financials  of  the  relevant  major  associates,  or  estimates  made  by  the  Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

The following tables set forth the reconciliations of the Group’s non-IFRS financial measures for the fourth quarter of 2021 

and 2020, the third quarter of 2021, and the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 to the nearest measures prepared in

INVESTMENTS HELD

As at 31 December 2021, our investment portfolio amounted to approximately RMB878,653 million  (31 December 2020:

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Management Discussion and Analysis

As at 31 December 2021, we held approximately 529 million shares in JD.com, a company operating an eCommerce platform 

in China, representing approximately 17% of its total outstanding shares. The fair value of this investment was approximately 

RMB118.5 billion, which accounted for approximately 7% of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2021. This investment 

was initially accounted for as investment in an associate and was then transferred to and accounted for as financial assets at 

fair value through other comprehensive income on 23 December 2021, following the resignation of the Group’s representative 

on the board of JD.com, Mr Lau Chi Ping Martin, as a director of JD.com (“Board Representative’s Resignation”). The cost 

of our investment in JD.com was approximately RMB20.9 billion. During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group did 

not  receive  any  dividends  from  JD.com,  and  there  were  deemed  disposal  gains  of  approximately  RMB78.0  billion  arising 

from the Board Representative’s Resignation and unrealised gains of approximately RMB6.2 billion arising from changes in 

fair value under equity. The Group does not have nor does it exercise any managerial influence on JD.com after the Board 

Representative’s Resignation and regards the investment in JD.com as a passive investment. Except JD.com, there was no 

other individual investment with a carrying value of 5% or more of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2021.

On 23 December 2021, the Board resolved to declare the Distribution in Specie. The JD.com Shares to be distributed under 

the Distribution in Specie were presented as “Assets held for distribution” in the consolidated statement of financial position 

of the Group as at 31 December 2021. The share certificates of the JD.com Shares to be distributed are dispatched to the 

qualifying shareholders in March 2022. Immediately following the completion of the Distribution in Specie, the Company’s 

beneficial  ownership  would  be  reduced  to  approximately  2.3%  in  JD.com  (based  on  the  total  number  of  issued  shares  of 

JD.com as at 31 December 2021). Please refer to the announcements of the Company dated 23 December 2021 and 25 

March 2022 for further details in relation to the Distribution in Specie. Notwithstanding the Distribution in Specie, the Group 

and JD.com will continue to maintain their business relationship in the ordinary course of business.

Save as disclosed herein, there were no material changes in our significant investment portfolio that need to be disclosed 

under paragraph 32 of Appendix 16 to the Listing Rules.

Management Discussion and Analysis

As at 31 December 2021, the Group had net debt of RMB20.2 billion, compared to net debt of RMB26.1 billion as at 30 

September  2021.  The  sequential  improvement  was  mainly  due  to  free  cash  flow  generation  and  on-market  divestitures  of 

certain listed securities, partly offset by our strategic investments in other companies.

For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Group had free cash flow of RMB33.5 billion. This was a result of net cash flow generated 

from operating activities of RMB51.3 billion, offset by payments for capital expenditures of RMB7.5 billion, payments for media 

content of RMB8.8 billion, and payments for lease liabilities of RMB1.5 billion.

As at 31 December 2021, bank balances and cash held at banks of the Group were mainly denominated in RMB. The Group 

considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange rates of currencies against major functional currencies would not 

result in a significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities denominated 

in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currencies are considered to be not significant.

As  at  31  December  2021,  the  Group’s  total  debts  comprised  borrowings  and  notes  payable.  Particulars  of  the  Group’s 

borrowings and notes payable are set out in Note 36 and Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements respectively.

The Group has floating rate debts, linked to USD LIBOR, including borrowings and senior notes, whose cash flows are hedged 

by using interest rate swaps. The effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s financial position and performance are set 

out in Note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Group assesses its creditworthiness based on its business and financial risk profile and monitors its capital by regularly 

reviewing  its  debts  to  adjusted  EBITDA  ratio,  being  the  measure  of  the  Group’s  ability  to  pay  off  all  of  its  debts  which  in 

turn reflects the Group’s financial health and liquidity position. Details are set out in Note 3.2 to the consolidated financial 

statements.

The Group had no material contingent liabilities outstanding as at 31 December 2021.

The dividend is expected to be payable on 6 June 2022 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members 

of the Company on 25 May 2022. The total final dividend proposed for the year is HKD1.60 per share.

On 23 December  2021, the Board resolved to declare a special interim dividend  in the  form of a distribution  in specie of 

approximately 457 million Class A ordinary shares of JD.com indirectly held by the Company to the shareholders whose names 

appeared on the register of members of the Company on 25 January 2022 in proportion to their then respective shareholdings 

in  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  1  Class  A  ordinary  share  of  JD.com  for  every  21  Shares  held  by  the  shareholders,  being 

rounded down to the nearest whole number of Class A ordinary shares of JD.com.

RESERVES

The Company may pay dividends out of share premium, retained earnings and any other reserves provided that immediately 

following the payment of such dividends, the Company will be in a position to pay off its debts as they fall due in the ordinary 

course of business.

As  at  31  December  2021,  the  Company  had  distributable  reserves  amounting  to  RMB66,701  million  (2020:  RMB45,952

volatility* (43.5% - 50%).

* 

The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the share prices of similar United States public companies for a period 

equal to the expected life preceding the grant date.

CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with  the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services 

in China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services 

and  other  telecommunications  value-added  services.  Accordingly,  the  value-added  telecommunications  business  of  the 

Group has been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan, Wang Dian, Beijing BIZCOM, Beijing Starsinhand and 

Shenzhen Tencent Tianyou (Wang Dian, Beijing BIZCOM, Beijing Starsinhand and Shenzhen Tencent Tianyou are referred 

herein as the “New OPCOs”, and together with Tencent Computer and Shiji Kaixuan, the “OPCOs”) by themselves or through 

their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History and Structure – Structure Contracts” 

of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group is able to recognise and receive 

the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts are also designed to provide the 

Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to acquire the equity interests in and/or 

assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2021, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has 

been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been removed.

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Directors’ Report

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2021

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening  the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games  and  the Examination and Approval of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定”規定》和中央編辦有關解釋,進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進口

網絡遊戲審批管理的通知)  (the  “Circular  13”)  jointly  issued  by  PRC  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication,  the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009, which provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via 

wholly-owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors 

from gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other 

joint venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

However, the Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between 

foreign online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether 

the  State  General  Administration  of  Press,  Publication,  Radio,  Film  and  Television  will  deem  the  Group’s  structure  and 

operations to be in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through OPCOs that hold the 

necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to Structure Contracts will be adopted or if adopted, 

what  they would provide. On 15 March 2019, the Standing Committee of National  People’s  Congress promulgated Law of 

Foreign Investment which became effective on 1 January 2020 (the “2019 Law of Foreign Investment”). While the 2019 Law of 

Foreign Investment does not define Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment explicitly, the Company cannot assure 

that future laws and regulations will not provide for Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be 

no assurance that the Company’s control over OPCOs through Structure Contracts will not be deemed as foreign investment in 

the future. If the Structure Contracts were to be deemed as a method of foreign investment under any future laws, regulations 

and rules, and if any of the Company’s business operations were to fall under the “negative list” for foreign investment, the 

Company would need to take further actions in order to comply with these laws, regulations and rules, which may materially 

and adversely affect its current corporate structure, business, financial condition and results of operations.

are subject to the Structure Contracts amounted to approximately RMB264 billion for the year ended 31 December 2021 and

made by the OPCOs to the holders of their equity interests and the terms of any new Structure Contracts entered into, renewed

The risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due to the legal constraints in relation to foreign investment in the telecommunications value-added services industry in the 

PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the WFOEs 

derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these intra-

group contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and adverse 

impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the tax 

treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

Other connected transactions

The Group entered into certain transactions with  “related parties” as defined under applicable accounting standards during 

the financial year ended 31 December 2021 which were disclosed in Note 13(a) (Senior management’s emoluments), Note 

13(b) (Five highest paid individuals), Note 14 (Benefits and interests of directors), Note 26 (Loans to investees and investees’ 

shareholders),  Note  35  (Share-based  payments)  and  Note  45  (Related  party  transactions)  to  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. Save as the related parties transactions involving payment of remuneration to certain directors of the Group which 

constitute continuing connected transactions fully exempt from the connected transaction requirements under Rule 14A.76(1) 

or  Rule  14A.95  of  the  Listing  Rules,  no  related  parties  transactions  disclosed  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements 

constitutes a connected transaction as defined under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules.

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

Maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  are  based  on  the  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code.  The  Board 

believes that throughout the year ended 31 December 2021, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 (now rearranged as C.2.1) regarding the segregation 

of the roles of the chairman and chief executive and A.4.2 (now rearranged as B.2.2) regarding the retirement and re-election 

of directors. The reasons for the deviations are further explained in the sub-sections headed “Chairman and Chief Executive 

Officer” and “Appointments, Re-election and Removal” below.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes 

when appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s 

execution of such strategy.

The  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be  responsible,  and  these  matters  are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this 

regard, the Board:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual business plan and budget;

PB

77

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

‧ 

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned;

‧ 

approves the Company’s financial statements and interim and annual reports;

‧ 

determines the Group’s communication policy;

‧ 

determines directors’ selection, orientation and evaluation;

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control,  internal  audit  and  regulatory  compliance 

procedures in place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders;

establishes Board committees with clear terms of reference and responsibilities as appropriate;

defines levels of delegation in respect of specific matters, with required authority to Board committees and management;

‧  monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the businesses of the Group;

‧ 

‧ 

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders; and

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness.

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which  includes  its  chief  officers,  the  president  and  executive  vice-presidents.  The  senior  management  team  meets  once 

every two weeks or as frequently as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior 

management  team  administers,  enforces,  interprets  and  supervises  compliance  with  the  internal  rules  and  operational 

procedures of the Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate 

amendments  to  such  rules  and  procedures.  The  senior  management  team  reports  to  the  Board  on  a  regular  basis  and 

communicates with the Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long-term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

78

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring that Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for carrying out their 

functions.

80

81

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

We believe education and training are important for maintaining  an effective Board.  New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2021, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The table below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2021:

Company held on 20 May 2021 (the “2021 AGM”).

80

81

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

A high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot be maintained only with the Board’s efforts. Each of the Group’s 

employees plays a role in contributing to such cause. A code of conduct which emphasises integrity and respect is distributed 

by the Company to all employees and it forms part of the employment agreement with each of the employees.

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

training has been and will continue to be provided to the directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on 

any updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

the  company  secretary  who  is  an  employee  of  the  Company  attends  training  in  compliance  with  the  Listing  Rules 

requirements; and

‧ 

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision A.2.1 

(now rearranged as C.2.1) of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate 

and should not be performed by the same individual, and that the division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief 

executive should be clearly established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in order to promote the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the roles of the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides,  all  major  decisions  have  been  made  in  consultation  with  members  of  the  Board  and  appropriate  committees,  as 

well as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to 

time to make presentations and answer the Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in 

all Board and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly 

briefed at the Board meetings, and he works with the senior management team to provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete 

and reliable information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is 

available for discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Chairman held a 

meeting with the independent non-executive directors without the presence of other directors as required by the Listing Rules.

82

83

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and make necessary 

changes when appropriate.

Composition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of eight directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors  and  four independent non-executive directors.  During  the year ended 31 December 2021 and up to  the date  of 

this annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board except that Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce has retired as an 

independent non-executive director with effect from the conclusion of the 2021 AGM.

A list of directors and their respective biographies which include their positions held at the Company and certain subsidiaries 

are set out on pages 56 to 59 of this annual report. There is no relationship (including financial, business, family or other 

material/relevant relationship(s)) among members of the Board.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in a professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings  and  bring  professional  judgment  and  advice  on  issues  relating  to  the  Group’s  strategies,  policies,  performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. The non-executive directors also take the lead where potential 

conflicts  of  interests  arise  and  exercise  their  professional  judgment  and  utilise  their  expertise  to  scrutinise  the  Company’s 

performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor performance reporting.

Further, in compliance with Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules, one of our independent non-executive directors has the appropriate 

professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice from time 

to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation annually 

of their independence and the Nomination Committee has conducted an annual review and considers that all independent 

non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing 

Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

82

83

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

Appointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons.  

At the 2021 AGM, Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce retired with effect from the conclusion of the 2021 AGM and Mr Yang Siu Shun 

retired and was re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 (now rearranged as B.2.2) of the CG Code provides that every director, including those appointed for a 

specific term, should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, this is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 (now rearranged as B.2.2) of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays 

a key role in the growth and development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to the sustainable 

development of the Group. Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers 

that the deviation from code provision A.4.2 (now rearranged as B.2.2) of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation 

of the Group as a whole.

As the re-election of Mr Li Dong Sheng, who was re-elected in 2018, was not considered at the 2021 AGM, there is a deviation 

from code provision A.4.2 (now rearranged as B.2.2) of the CG Code. Notwithstanding Mr Li Dong Sheng was not subject to 

retirement by rotation at the 2021 AGM, his biography and details of his emoluments are set out in the Directors’ Report and 

Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements respectively for shareholders’ information. The Nomination Committee has 

assessed and confirmed the independence of Mr Li Dong Sheng in 2021. Considering that the re-election of Mr Li Dong Sheng 

will be considered at the 2022 AGM, the Board believes that such deviation does not have a material impact on the operation 

of the Company as a whole.

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, in 

consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors are 

given the opportunity to include matters for discussion in the agenda. The company secretary also ensures that all applicable 

rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the Board meeting 

to each of the directors at least 14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary also sends the 

agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in advance of each 

regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial performance and 

latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as promptly and fully 

as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, such director 

will declare his/her interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s senior 

management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 

in appropriate circumstances.

The  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  ensuring  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. Draft and final version of the minutes of meetings are sent to the 

directors  for  comments  and  records  respectively  within  a  reasonable  time  after  each  meeting,  and  final  minutes  with  the 

relevant board papers and related materials are kept by the company secretary and are available for review and inspection by 

the directors at any time.

THE COMMITTEES

As described above, the Board has established five committees, each of which has been delegated responsibilities and reports 

back to the Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and 

Remuneration Committee. The roles and functions of these committees are set out in their respective terms of reference. The 

terms of reference of each of these committees will be revised from time to time to ensure that they continue to meet the needs 

of the Company and to ensure compliance with the CG Code. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Nomination 

Committee and the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s website.

and the board nomination policy, and also considered and made recommendations to the Board on the re-appointment of 

the retiring directors at the 2021 AGM. The board diversity policy was revised and adopted in March 2022. The Nomination 

Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive directors and considers all of them to be 

independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of the 

length of service of each independent non-executive director, and the perspectives, skills and experience that such director 

can bring to the Board. The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a 

business imperative that will help the Company achieve its strategic objectives and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, 

the Board has set measurable objectives for the implementation of the board diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the 

appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business 

strategy and maintain the effectiveness of the Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy 

and the board nomination policy are successfully implemented with reference to the measurable objectives. The Nomination 

Committee will continue to conduct periodic review and monitor the implementation of the board diversity policy and the board 

nomination policy to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Purpose and Objectives

The board diversity policy aims to set out the approach to enable the Nomination Committee to 

achieve diversity on the Board.

Policy Statement

The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board

92

93

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

Independent Views

In assessing whether a potential candidate is qualified to become an independent non-executive 

director of the Company, the Nomination Committee and the Board will consider, among others, 

whether  the  candidate  is  able  to  devote  sufficient  time  on  performing  his/her  duties  as  an 

independent non-executive director of the Company, and the background and qualification of the 

candidate, in order to assess whether such candidate is able to bring independent views to the 

Board.

In  considering  whether  an  independent  non-executive  director  should  be  proposed  for 

re-election, the Nomination Committee and the Board will assess and evaluate the independent 

non-executive  director’s  contribution  to  the  Board  during  the  term,  in  particular,  whether  the 

independent non-executive director is able to bring independent views to the Board.

The  Company  will  ensure  that  there  are  channels  (in  addition  to  independent  non-executive 

directors)  where  independent  views  are  available,  including  but  not  limited  to  availability  of 

access by directors of the Company to external independent professional advice to assist their 

performance of duties.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong 

Sheng (both are independent non-executive directors) and Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker (non-executive director). The 

Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Ian Charles Stone.

The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2021. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is set 

out on page 85.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration package of each director.

The Remuneration Committee’s major work during the year 2021 includes the following:

‧ 

reviewing and recommending to the Board in respect of the remuneration policies and structure of the Company by 

benchmarking peer companies with a similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages are competitive

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

ACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibilities, the Board ensures that the assessment over the Group’s performance and prospects 

are  clearly  and  comprehensively  presented.  The  directors  acknowledge  that  it  is  their  ultimate  responsibility  to  prepare 

the  accounts  which  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  financial  position  of  the  Group  on  a  going-concern  basis  and  other 

announcements  and  financial  disclosures.  To  assist  the  Board  in  discharging  their  responsibilities,  management  provides 

updates  to  the  Board  from  time  to  time,  including  the  Group’s  detailed  business  and  financial  position,  in  order  to  give 

the directors a balanced, understandable and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects  of the Group. 

Management also provides all necessary and relevant information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and 

information they need to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information 

put before them for approval. The Auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the “Independent 

Auditor’s Report” of this annual report.

Adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s strategic objectives. Risk management and internal control systems shall ensure the Company’s effective business 

operation, the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, as well as the compliance with applicable laws, regulations and 

policies.

The Board acknowledges that it is their responsibility to ensure that the Company has established and maintained adequate 

and effective risk management and internal control systems. The Board delegates their responsibility to the Audit Committee 

to  review  the  practices  of  management  with  respect  to  risk  management  and  internal  control,  including  the  design, 

implementation  and  supervision  of  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  Audit 

Committee  also  reviews  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  on  an  annual  basis.  The 

Board is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the Company’s acceptable level 

of  risk,  and  proactively  considering,  analysing  and  formulating  strategies  to  manage  the  Company’s  significant  risks.  The 

risks mentioned above also include, but are not limited to, significant risks related to the environment, social and governance 

aspects of the Company.

Under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  Board,  the  Company  has  adopted  a  risk  management  and  internal  control 

structure, referred to as the “Three Lines of Defence” model, to ensure the effectiveness of its risk management and internal 

control systems.

First Line of Defence – Operation and Management

Our First Line of Defence is mainly comprised of business and functional departments of each business group of the Company 

who  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operation  and  management.  They  are  responsible  for  designing  and  implementing 

controls to address the risks.

94

95

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

Second Line of Defence – Risk Management

Our Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. They are responsible for formulating policies related to the risk management 

and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk control systems. 

To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  such  systems,  they  also  assist  and  supervise  the  first  line  of  defence  in  the 

establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

Third Line of Defence – Independent Assurance

Our Third Line of Defence is comprised of the IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing independent evaluation on the effectiveness 

of  the  Company’s  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  and  monitoring  the  Company’s  improvement  on  risk 

management and internal controls.

The  Company  has  formulated  policies  and  established  management  systems  to  enhance  and  support  the  Company’s 

compliance  with  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations.  The  Anti-fraud  Investigation  Department  is  responsible  for  receiving 

whistleblower reports through various channels and following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists 

management in promoting the  “Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct” (the “Sunshine Code”) and the value of integrity to all 

employees of the Company.

The IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department have direct reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

The Three Lines of Defence model of the risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than 

eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives of the Company, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute 

assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board and management have always placed importance on the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 

In  2021,  the  Company  has  invested  more  resources  in  the  continuous  improvement  of  the  risk  management  and  internal 

control  systems,  which  have  also  continuously  increased  the  awareness  of  risk  management  among  the  employees.  The 

internal control function has continuously worked closely with and provided proactive support to the business groups in their 

business development and risk management. Furthermore, the IA has also continued to promote the deployment of various 

internal audit projects and continuous audits to provide more effective and timelier independent evaluations. The Anti-fraud 

Investigation Department further strengthened the values of integrity among the employees, followed up and investigated the 

alleged fraudulent activities. The connection and interaction among the three lines of defence have been further enhanced to 

provide more effective support to the Company’s development.

Risk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving its risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

and its risk management ability, to ensure long-term growth and sustainable development of the Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” internal monitoring model 

as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party in the system as well as the relevant 

risk management policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses 

any risks that may negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The 

Company also provides risk management and internal control training for staff on a regular basis.

Risk Management Process

Being an Internet and technology company with a wide variety of rapidly-changing businesses, the Company has adopted the 

following dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

‧  Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

‧ 

The  IC  collects,  analyses  and  consolidates  a  list  of  significant  risks  at  the  business  level,  and  provides  input  on  risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses  and control measures will be reviewed by  management and subsequently by the  Audit Committee before 

reporting to the Board;

‧ 

‧ 

The IC analyses and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with support from the IC.

96

97

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Corporate Governance Report

Significant Risks of the Company

As the complexity of the Company’s business increases and the external environment continues to evolve, the Company faces 

significant risks, including but not limited to ESG risk. Through risk management analysis and evaluation, the management has 

identified ten significant risks for the financial year 2021, nine of which remained the same as disclosed in financial year 2020. 

Among the nine significant risks, the “Regulatory and compliance risk”, “Crisis management, public relations and reputation 

risk”, “Information security risk” and “M&A and investment management risk” have increased while the other risks remain 

at a similar level as last year. Meanwhile, considering the global macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility and the impact of 

COVID-19 epidemic, one new significant risk, “Macroeconomic risk”, is included in 2021.

On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee supervises the overall risk status of the Company and assesses the change in 

the nature and severity of the Company’s major risks. The Audit Committee considers that management has taken appropriate 

measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a level acceptable to the Board.

Below is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk 

profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

1.  Regulatory and compliance risk

Regulatory authorities around the world have heightened the regulatory requirements for the Internet and technology 

industry  and  have  introduced  new  laws  and  regulations.  As  the  Company  continuously  expands  its  businesses  both 

locally and overseas, it is required to keep up and comply with the relevant applicable laws and regulations in different 

countries  and  jurisdictions,  including  but  not  limited  to  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  privacy  and  data  protection, 

anti-trust,  anti-unfair  competition,  IP,  telecommunications  and  Internet,  gaming,  Internet  finance,  labour  protection, 

foreign investment, international trade, etc. In addition, the development of various industries around the world may be 

impacted by global regulatory uncertainties and uncertainties in international relations.

professional consultants to work closely and communicate with management, communicating with regulatory authorities

2.  Macroeconomic risk

The  Company’s  revenue  generated  from  certain  businesses  is  closely  related  to  the  macroeconomy  and  the  overall 

consumption  environment.  Global  and  regional  economic  uncertainties,  COVID-19  epidemic  and  other  factors  may 

reduce  individual  users’  purchasing  power  and  their  willingness  to  consume,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  corporates’ 

revenue and thereby leading to a reduction in the resources they invest in market and business development. All of the 

above factors may adversely affect certain revenue streams of the Company. The changes in trading and investment 

policies and market changes resulting from the changes in international circumstances and the epidemic may negatively 

affect  the  Company’s  operation,  market  and  collaboration  with  its  business  partners,  which  may  in  turn  affect  and 

weaken the Company’s competitiveness and growth potential.

In response to the macroeconomic uncertainties, the Company adjusts its business development strategy in a scientific, 

flexible and reasonable manner to align with the macroeconomic environment, and to continuously seek opportunities for 

business development. The Company attaches great importance to product and service solutions, achieves sustainable 

business growth through the improvement of user experience, and builds  long-term  and stable  relationships with  its 

existing  customers.  Despite  an  adverse  macroeconomic  environment  where  economic  growth  slows  down,  epidemic 

remains volatile, and international relations remain uncertain, the Company will continue to provide product solutions 

and  digital  services  to  assist  corporates  in  further  enhancing  competitiveness  and  improving  productivity  during  this 

particular period, create value for its customers and business partners, and fulfill its social responsibility with the mission 

of “Tech for Good”.

3.  Crisis management, public relations and reputation risk

As an Internet and technology company with a diverse portfolio of businesses, products, users and business partners, as 

well as increasingly complex business models, the Company draws attention from the public and media. The Company 

needs to fully consider possible crisis and actively responds to them, to avoid the escalation of problems or crisis. The 

Company also needs to disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public. Otherwise, it may damage the 

Company’s reputation, brand and image, and adversely affect the business and prospects of the Company.

In adherence to the principles of openness and transparency, the Company has communicated with the public in a 

timely manner and disclosed comprehensive and proper information. In response to crisis, the Company has established 

the  corresponding  emergency  response  mechanism,  to  follow  up  on  the  progression  of  crisis,  assess  risks,  make 

prompt decisions, and adjust its businesses to reduce the impact. The Company has set up professional public relations 

department  and  teams  for  crisis  management  to  continuously  improve  its  crisis  management  and  public  relations 

capabilities,  with  established  emergency  response  and  public  relations  management  mechanisms,  and  to  provide 

training and guidance related to crisis management. The public relations teams have maintained close interaction with 

management  and  business  groups  of  the  Company,  to  continuously  gather  public  opinions,  analyse  relevant  market 

information for management to enable management timely respond and disclose comprehensive and proper information 

to the public according to the Company’s policies and procedures; and protect the Company’s reputation.

4. 

Information security risk

All  countries  and  jurisdictions  continue  to  heighten  its  supervision  over  cyber  security  and  personal  information 

protection.  Protecting  and  safeguarding  user  and  customer  data  is  the  top  priority  of  the  Company.  The  Company 

continues to pay attention to the laws and policies relating to user privacy and data protection in various jurisdictions and 

is fully aware that any loss or leakage of such information could have a significant negative impact on the affected users 

and customers. This could expose the Company to significant liability and significant reputational risk.

The Company strongly believes that protecting user and customer data is the key prerequisite for delivering secured 

and high-quality products and user experience. With a strong commitment to protecting data privacy and security, the 

Company strictly complies with applicable laws and regulations, and strives to provide the highest level of protection 

on such information and data. In this regard, the Company has formulated and kept optimising control measures to 

protect such information and data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, encryption, 

access restrictions and controls, the establishment of appropriate and effective management processes, and continuous 

improvement of the business continuity and disaster recovery management. In addition, the Company arranges regular 

reviews  by  independent  specialists  over  the  Company’s  data  protection  practices;  and  provides  training  for  staff  to 

enhance their awareness of information security.

5.  Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet and technology industry is highly competitive, innovative and ever-changing at all times. The development of 

technologies brings evolutional changes to the existing business models; and the cross-sectoral expansion of non-Internet 

and technology companies bring in more new players into the market. Users’ expectations for innovative products and 

services are also increasing. Therefore, how to create value for more users and promote innovative and sustainable social 

values through innovation in technology, product and business model are the key challenges of the Company.

The Company stays on top of trends in market and industry development, as well as user needs, keeps up with the 

technological development through innovation in frontier  technology and  explores application of technologies in  new 

scenarios.  The  Company  stays  focused  on  expectation  changes  in  user  experience,  stays  active  in  promoting  the 

incubation  of  new  business,  keeps  exploring  new  forms  of  business,  and  recruits  talent,  optimises  its  organisational 

structure,  and  enhances  the  innovation  capabilities  by  improving  talent  quality  with  cultivating  young  talent.  The 

Company  also  continuously  enhances  its  technical  capabilities  and  innovation  environment  to  develop  products  that 

meet the expectations of the market, to continuously improve user experience and to maintain its competitiveness in the 

market. The Company collaborates with its partners to jointly innovate, enhance its service capabilities, and create value 

for users and the society.

6.  M&A and investment management risk

The  Company  has  a  certain  scale  of  investment  activities  in  diverse  fields.  It  is  important  for  the  Company  to  adopt 

robust procedures in the formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment 

evaluation stage as well as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly and effectively manage investment risks could 

hinder the realisation of investment strategies and lead to probable financial loss of the Company.

The  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously  and  has  established  an  Investment  Committee 

under  the  Board,  dedicated  an  investment  team  to  identify  investment  opportunities,  appointed  finance,  legal  and 

other relevant professional teams to manage relevant risks, put in place the investment risk evaluation and approval 

process, and conducted comprehensive analysis. The Company has also designated finance, legal and other relevant 

professional teams to support and monitor the performance of the investee companies. These teams periodically analyse 

and review relevant operating and financial information of the investee companies to ensure that they continue to satisfy 

the Company’s investment strategies. In addition, the Company has invested resources in internal audit and internal 

control functions to continuously support the management of its controlling subsidiaries in establishing more sound risk 

management and internal control systems.

7.  ToB business risk

The Company has actively developed various ToB businesses related to Industrial Internet. With the rapid development 

of the ToB business, if the Company fails to adjust its business strategy to respond to changes in industry trends and 

market needs on a timely basis, to keep optimising its organisational structure with support from professional talent, to 

improve its internal management system and processes for ToB business, to enhance its supply chain management 

capabilities, and to improve its cooperation mechanisms with various business partners, it may face more managerial 

challenges,  and  may  affect  the  sustainable  development  of  its  ToB  business  and  the  realisation  of  the  Company’s 

strategic goals.

The Company continues to accumulate and solidify its experience in the ToB business by analysing development trends 

in different industries and changes in user needs. The Company has started to increase its footprints in the ToB business 

by  integrating  cloud  computing,  AI,  Internet  of  Things,  security  and  other  advanced  technologies  for  deployments 

in  various  industry-specific  scenarios,  to  build  a  new,  intelligent  ecosystem  that  efficiently  connects  customers  and 

enterprises.  This  has  been  applied  across  many  industries  including  social  services,  tourism,  healthcare,  industry, 

agriculture, transport, energy, retail, financial services, etc. Furthermore, the Company is continuously developing its ToB 

business, optimising its management over business structure, human resources, management policies and business 

processes, and improving its supply chain management capabilities to ensure the effective operation of the ToB business 

for  rapid  and  sustainable  development.  Through  continuous  technological  innovation,  the  Company  continues  to 

enhance its ability to serve corporate clients and to promote the integration and development of the digital economy with 

the real economy.

8.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high-quality user experience. Any material 

functional defect, interruption, breakdown or other issues in connection are likely to adversely impact the Company’s 

businesses. In addition, the Company’s operations may be affected by uncontrollable external factors such as natural 

disasters, social security events, epidemic disease or energy supply. Relevant incidents may damage workplaces and 

equipment that are vital to the Company and its business partners, and threaten the health of their employees, which 

results in disruption of Company’s normal operation.

The Company continues to invest in its network infrastructure to enhance its established business recovery mechanism 

to ensure network security in order to provide consistent support to business development. Meanwhile, the Company 

has  established  dedicated  teams  to  develop  business  contingency  plans  and  to  perform  regular  drills.  All  business 

departments  also  implemented  various  emergency  measures  to  ensure  smooth  business  operation.  In  addition,  an 

independent dedicated team has been set up to perform regular checks on the effectiveness of the relevant emergency 

mechanisms  and  measures,  as  well  as  the  drills  and  its  results.  In  terms  of  energy  use,  the  Company  continues  to 

increase  the  proportion  of  renewable  energy,  deploy  rooftop  solar  PV  system  for  data  centers,  build  energy  storage 

stations, and participate in green power trading. In the post-pandemic era, the Company’s emergency response team 

continues  to  operate  effectively,  closely  monitoring  risks,  keeping  up  with  policy  changes,  and  responding  to  both 

risks  and  policy  changes  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner.  For  example,  the  Company  provides  mobile  working 

solution  plan  and  various  functional  support,  to  support  the  business  group  in  responding  to  urgent  needs  through 

adjusting resource allocation and timely deployment of emergency measures to ensure employee safety and continued 

operations of the Company’s business. The Company also performs emergency drills to improve business’s capabilities 

in responding to emergencies. Meanwhile, the Company also works closely with partners to seek solutions to application 

scenarios during these special periods, and to jointly build an open, innovative and secured digital ecosystem to support 

the economic recovery and business development in the post-pandemic era.

10.  Fraud risk

In  recent  years,  fraudulent  activities  have  occurred  frequently  in  the  Internet  and  technology  industry  and  therefore 

integrity has been an important concern. As the Company continues to develop its business, the form and complexity of 

its business evolved, and consequently the fraud risk inevitably increased to a certain extent. For example, fraudulent 

activities caused by collusion between suppliers/business partners and employees can have a negative impact on the 

reputation and financial position of the Company.

The Company, with its belief in the value of integrity, has zero tolerance for fraud, and is determined to fight against 

any fraudulent activities. The Company has established effective internal control systems and is continuously improving 

it. These systems have been strengthened by systematic, transparent control measures and procedures. To enhance 

and promote integrity, the Company continuously conducts various training for its employees, suppliers, and business 

partners.  For  employees,  the  Company  has  established  the  Sunshine  Code  that  the  employees  shall  strictly  follow 

during their employment and in the course of business dealing with suppliers and business partners. For suppliers and 

business partners, the Company cooperates with them to create an ecosystem with integrity. The Company has signed 

an Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration with its suppliers and business partners to alert the counterparts the importance 

of ethical value and to build a healthy and transparent environment for business. Furthermore, the Company has set up 

an Anti-fraud Investigation Department for years to proactively collect whistleblowing cases from various channels, and 

to follow up and investigate alleged fraudulent cases on a timely basis. The Company will terminate the employment 

immediately with any employee who has been found to be involved in any fraudulent activities. The Company may also 

pass the relevant case to initiate legal proceeding according to the relevant laws and regulations under more serious 

circumstances. Any supplier/business partner found to be involved in any fraudulent activities will be blacklisted and 

deprived of the opportunity to work with the Company permanently. The Company will announce to the public those 

criminal cases and serious abuse-of-power cases that were investigated and handled by the Company via the “Sunshine 

Tencent” WeChat official platform. This shows the Company’s determination to fight against corruption and fraud, as well 

as its commitment towards creating a virtuous and honest atmosphere within the Company and the industry.

Internal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems  and  has  implemented  its  internal  control 

systems according to the COSO Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party as well as the authorisation 

and approvals required for the key actions of each party. Policies and procedures are in place for the key business processes. 

This information is clearly conveyed to employees in practice and emphasised the importance of the internal control systems. 

All employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational issues that set 

the control standards for the management of each business process.

In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework  and  guides 

the  management  of  each  business  group  to  carry  out  the  self-assessment.  The  IC  is  also  responsible  for  collecting 

and  summarising  the  results  of  self-assessment.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Company  reviews  this  summarised 

self-assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of management to the Audit Committee and the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensures that management has implemented appropriate measures and reports the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

The Company has also engaged independent professional consulting firms to perform a review of the Group’s internal control 

framework and an assessment of its internal audit quality to ensure their standards are in compliance with international best 

practices.

The Company has in place a framework for the handling and disclosure of inside information in compliance with the SFO. The 

framework sets out the procedures and internal controls for the handling and dissemination of inside information in a timely 

manner so as to allow all the shareholders and stakeholders to assess the latest position of the Group.

Under the framework, if an employee is aware of any project, transaction, information or situation which he/she thinks could 

potentially be inside information, he/she should contact the Head of Compliance and Transactions Department, the general 

counsel and the company secretary as soon as possible. Legal analysis and consultations with the Company’s directors and 

senior executives will be made so as to identify whether any such information constitutes inside information and is required to 

be disclosed to the public pursuant to the SFO. The framework and its effectiveness are subject to review on a regular basis 

according to established procedures.

1.  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

Tencent’s Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) strategy is guided by our long-established mission and vision, 

“Value  for  Users,  Tech  for  Good”.  The  mission  and  vision,  in  which  our  employees  respond  to  what  they  like  most 

about Tencent in the annual employee surveys, is the driving force behind the incorporation of ESG considerations into 

our products, services and business operations. In view of the rapid changes in societal and business environments, 

including the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather, macroeconomic challenges, regulatory tightening, mobile internet 

ubiquity and new enabling technologies, as well as the digital upgrade of local economies, we have strengthened our 

capabilities to manage the associated risks and nurture new opportunities. Since April 2021, we have taken an innovative 

and  coordinated  approach  to  create  value  for  our  users,  business  partners  and  the  society,  and  to  strengthen  our 

foundation in ESG governance. Specifically:

‧  We upgraded our corporate strategy to promote “Sustainable Innovations for Social Value” alongside our existing 

consumer internet and industrial internet strategies.

‧  We integrated our corporate social responsibility and charitable activities to form a new Sustainable Social Value 

(“SSV”)  organisation.  SSV  is  funded  with  an  initial  capital  of  RMB50  billion  to  invest  in  key  areas,  including 

research  in  basic  sciences,  education  innovation,  rural  revitalisation,  carbon  neutrality,  primary  healthcare, 

philanthropic platform, assisting with public emergencies, technologies enabling the silver generation, enhanced 

accessibility,  and  digitalisation  of  culture.  We  allocated  an  additional  RMB50  billion  to  support  the “Common 

Prosperity” initiative in China.

‧  We established a new ESG governance structure to support the Board’s expanded oversight on the Company’s 

ESG  matters,  coordinate  internal  priorities  and  engage  stakeholders  via  the  ESG  Working  Group  and  the  ESG 

Coordination Office.

Our  ESG  strategy  focuses  on  the  management  of  risks  and  the  pursuit  of  opportunities,  unlocked  by  the  ongoing 

convergence  of  physical  and  virtual  worlds  as  well  as  the  digital  transformation  enabling  industries  to  extend  their 

presence online and expand globally. The implementation of our ESG strategy can be summarised as follows:

2.  ESG GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

ESG  governance  at  Tencent  is  overseen  by  the  Board’s  Corporate  Governance  Committee  and  implemented  by  the 

Company’s ESG Working Group.

In  2021,  the  Corporate  Governance  Committee  expanded  its  focus  to  ESG  oversight.  It  shall  report  regularly  to  the 

Board relevant ESG issues as well as the progress of key performance indicators (“KPIs”). The Corporate Governance 

Committee  shall  exercise  oversight  via  inquiries,  regular  updates  on  the  Company’s  ESG  initiatives,  reviewing  and 

approving annual ESG reports submitted by the ESG Working Group.

The ESG Working Group (the “Working Group”) is a cross-functional body established in January 2022 and reports to 

the Corporate Governance Committee twice a year. The Working Group, which is tasked to advance Tencent’s overall 

ESG performance and promotes internal coordination, operates on three levels:

‧ 

ESG Steering Team leads the Working Group to set out the Company’s ESG strategy and priorities. Co-chaired by 

the Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, it has a good representation of senior executives from various 

business groups or functional lines covering specific ESG topics.

1 

Our standalone ESG report will be downloadable from our Company Website. We decided to distribute electronic versions only in favour 

of nature conservation and carbon emissions reduction. Our ESG report will only be published on a standalone basis for the financial 

years commencing on or after 1 January 2022.

ESG  Coordination  Office  supports  the  ESG  Steering  Team  in  identifying  ESG  objectives  and  collaborating  with 

various business and functional teams to develop action plans and track progress. In addition, it serves as the 

secretariat of the Working Group and reports the Company’s ESG matters to the Corporate Governance Committee 

regularly.

‧ 

ESG Champions comprise of employee representatives from various business groups and functional teams covering 

specific ESG topics. Leveraging their respective areas of expertise, ESG Champions drive the implementation of the 

Company’s ESG initiatives and provide regular updates to the ESG Coordination Office.

We will review the composition of the Working Group from time and time to ensure the Corporate Governance Committee 

is kept abreast of the Company’s ESG initiatives and overall performance.

3.  BOARD STATEMENT

The  Board  oversees  ESG  matters  via  the  Corporate  Governance  Committee  and  is  engaged  in  formulating  and 

implementing the Company’s ESG strategy. The Corporate Governance Committee supported the Company’s decision to 

strengthen ESG governance via the establishment of the ESG Working Group, where the ESG Coordination Office serves 

as the secretariat.

The  Board  was  involved  in  the  materiality  assessment  and  prioritisation  of  key  ESG  topics  of  Tencent,  which  was 

conducted by an independent professional consultancy. The Board has participated in surveys and interviews that solicit 

views and recommendations on ESG topics that may have significant influence on the Company’s long-term sustainability 

(please refer to the sections titled “Stakeholder Engagement” and “Assessment on the Materiality of the ESG Topics” for 

more details). Key ESG risks have been incorporated into the Company’s comprehensive risk management system. From 

principal business leaders to senior management, the Group has formulated  risk response measures by considering 

the possibility, impact, and trends of key ESG risks. The Board has regularly reviewed these key risks at the Board and 

Corporate Governance Committee meetings and has made recommendations to the measures taken.

During  the  reporting  period,  the  Board  has  reviewed  the  Company’s  carbon  neutrality  plan,  progress  in  certain 

sustainable social value projects and the annual ESG report.

5.  OUR CULTURE

The Company is committed to strengthening our corporate culture, which is built upon our values, vision and purpose. 

Our values are integrity, proactivity, collaboration and creativity.

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

Integrity means to uphold principles, ethics, openness and fairness;

Proactivity means to pursue positive contributions, volunteer for responsibility and push for breakthroughs;

Collaboration means to be inclusive and collaborative, and strive to progress and evolve; and

Creativity means to push for breakthrough innovations, and explore the possibilities of the future.

Our values and culture, which crystallised into our mission to create “Value for Users, Tech for Good”, has guided the 

Company  to  incorporate  social  responsibility  into  our  products  and  services,  help  industries  digitally  transform  and 

collaborate  with  stakeholders  to  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  society.  The  Company  has  continued 

to promote our culture and adopt various policies and initiatives to provide additional guidance to our employees. For 

example:

‧  We have developed the Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct (the “Sunshine Code”) which, amongst others, sets 

the ethical standards and behaviour expected of our employees and prohibits activities that are not in compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations, and published an Anti-fraud and whistleblowing Policy that outlines multiple 

whistleblowing channels. 

‧  We voluntarily pledged to reach carbon neutrality in our operations and supply chains, and to transition to 100% 

green power by 2030.

‧  We developed technologies and software-as-a-solution products, including but not limited to WeCom and Tencent 

Meeting, to help industries reduce their carbon footprint and accelerate digital transformation.

‧  We have developed technologies and solutions for social well-being, including but not limited to mobile applications 

suitable for the silver generation, enhanced accessibility solutions for communities with activity limitations as well 

as youth programmes that inspire creativity and teach coding skills.

114

115

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

6.  ENVIRONMENT

We are committed to protecting the environment and conserving natural resources to ensure sustainability for future 

generations. In 2021, we voluntarily pledged to reach carbon neutral for our operations and supply chains by 2030, and 

announced our commitment to fully transition to green power.

From operating our platforms daily to building our network of data centres, we have considered energy conservation, 

waste  reduction,  ecological  impact,  and  climate-related  risks  in  our  decision-making  process  and  policies.  This  has 

enabled  us  to  meet  the  applicable  regulatory  requirements  in  China,  including  the Energy Conservation Law of the 

People’s Republic of China  and Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China.  In  2020,  China 

announced that the country would reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and may introduce new regulatory requirements to 

ensure that this target can be met. The Company will closely monitor the latest developments and endeavour to tackle 

climate change.

6.1  Tackling Climate Change

The risks and impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly significant. Tencent is committed to identifying 

and mitigating the impacts of climate change on our strategy, business operations, and financial performance. 

In 2021, we joined the global climate action (for example, achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and 

China’s  “3060”  goal)  by  pledging  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  in  our  operations  and  supply  chains  (including 

Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) as well as transition to 100% green power by 2030.

Governance

Climate-related  risks  and  issues  are  considered  and  monitored  by  the  Board  via  the  Corporate  Governance 

Committee.  Climate  change  is  regarded  as  a  specific  issue  for  revision  and  discussion.  During  the  reporting 

period, the Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the Company’s carbon footprint, net-zero goal, and 

decarbonisation pathways.

Strategy

We acknowledge that climate change brings physical and transition risks and opportunities to our business. Our 

physical risks primarily result from acute and chronic risks caused by climate change, while transition risks mainly 

come from the market and policy changes that arise during the transition to a low-carbon economy. Reputational 

risks are linked to the potential failure in fulfilling our commitment to developing into a low-carbon business. On 

the other hand, climate change would also provide us with the opportunity to improve our energy efficiency and 

develop low-carbon technologies and climate-resilient products and services.

116

117

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

In terms of physical risks, acute climate events caused by climate change, such as frequent typhoon weather and 

rainstorms, may affect our operational continuity. On the other hand, chronic risks, such as high temperatures 

and droughts may increase energy consumption and operating costs for our offices and data centres. Rising sea 

or water levels may lead to loss of assets in certain regions. We have considered the impact of regional climate 

when allocating assets and have formulated emergency measures for acute climate events to avoid and reduce 

operational impacts or asset losses.

There are transition risks as well. In the context of accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, if we fail to 

effectively control or reduce the carbon emissions generated from our operations and provide low-carbon services 

and products, it may result in reputational damage, loss of users, or market share reduction. Our carbon neutrality 

initiative follows the principle of “prioritising the use of  active emissions reduction measures while keeping  the 

use of carbon offsets to a minimum”. In addition to achieving our carbon neutrality goal, we aim to play a leading 

role in the transition towards a low-carbon society by (i) fostering open innovation and knowledge sharing and (ii) 

leveraging the reach and influence of our platforms and products.

We believe that climate change has also brought various opportunities to Tencent. By improving the efficiencies 

of energy consumption and water use at our office buildings and data centres, we could optimise operating costs 

and minimise sensitivity to changes in carbon trading prices. We provide various products and services, including 

Tencent  Cloud,  WeCom,  Tencent  Meeting  to  help  our  users  reduce  their  carbon  footprint  and  accelerate  their 

digital transformation.

Risk Management

We  have  integrated  ESG  risks  into  the  Company’s  overall  risk  assessment  and  management  system,  including 

risks related to climate change. As part of our climate risk assessment, we consider the probability and the relative 

impact of the risks on our Company.

In  2021,  the  Board  and  senior  management  evaluated  the  relative  impacts  of  the  climate-related  risk  factors, 

including  acute  physical  risk,  chronic  physical  risk,  policy  &  legal  risk,  technology  risk,  market  risk,  and 

reputational risk on the business, and provided mitigation and adaptation responses. For acute physical risks, we 

have taken extreme weather events, such as rainstorms, typhoons and high temperatures into consideration during 

our site selection, construction, and operations of our data centres. We have also drafted corresponding mitigation 

and adaptation measures to address the potential impacts of these events.

116

117

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Metrics and Targets

We  pledge  to  reach  carbon  neutrality  across  our  operations  and  supply  chains  by  2030,  and  to  switch  our 

electricity supply to 100% green power or renewable energy where feasible. We have signed on the Science-Based 

Targets initiative (“SBTi”) and will work to refine targets for our decarbonisation pathways in the following months.

Based on the Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Protocol, we began an internal review of our greenhouse gas emissions 

and used 2021 as the base year to develop our carbon neutrality roadmap and decarbonisation pathways. Our 

total emissions of 5.111 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents includes:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

Scope 1: Direct emissions from operations owned or controlled by the Company (Scope 1) amounted to 0.019 

million MtCO2e, or 0.4% of the emissions.

Scope  2:  Indirect  emissions  generated  by  purchased  electricity  and  other  purchased  energy  (Scope  2) 

amounted to 2.349 million MtCO2e, or 45.9% of the emissions.

Scope 3: Indirect emissions generated from the supply chains (Scope 3) amounted to 2.743 million MtCO2e, 

or 53.7% of the emissions.

We followed the best practice of prioritising the use of active emissions reduction measures while keeping the use 

of carbon offsets to a minimum. We will reduce or avoid emissions via a series of measures, including energy-

saving initiatives, technological and management innovations to increase power use efficiency2, transition to green 

power or renewable energy by procurement as well as building and investing in renewable energy projects. Steps 

to achieve our targets can be found in the “Energy Management” section.

We  will  help  mobilise  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  society  by  leveraging  the  influence  of  our  products  and 

technological capabilities. For our users, we will promote a low-carbon lifestyle. For our business partners, we will 

assist them in their low-carbon transformation by providing innovative products and enabling technologies.

Details of Tencent’s carbon neutrality goals can be found in the Tencent Carbon Neutrality Target and Roadmap 

Report.

6.2  Energy Management

Energy Management in Office Buildings

Environmental considerations are incorporated into the design, construction, and operation of our office buildings. 

All our new office buildings in China are designed and constructed to attain the Green Building Two Star standards.

Our “Management + Technology + Procedure” approach underpins our energy conservation measures, through 

which:

‧  We  manage  our  office  building’s  energy  and  water  consumption,  through  an  online  Tencent  Facility 

Management system. In addition, we have introduced a real-time monitoring system for self-owned buildings, 

which provides statistical analysis on electricity and water consumption.

‧  We  continuously  seek  ways  to  improve  our  energy  efficiency  by  regularly  evaluating  our  office  buildings’ 

energy consumption and optimising our energy consumption through innovative technologies. In 2021, we 

executed energy-saving renovation projects in Tencent Binhai Towers: (i) we replaced LED lighting in our 

public areas, optimised lighting duration for our underground car parks, and (ii) installed thermostats and 

fan coil systems with automatic switches in our IT machine rooms and power distribution machine rooms.

‧  Our energy-saving policy drives our day-to-day energy-saving measures. Office lights and air conditioners are 

automatically turned on/off based on the schedule of employees. Whenever employees leave the workplace 

or meeting rooms, they are also encouraged to manually switch them off. We also have stringent onsite office 

management in place with routine inspections, where the property management companies closely monitor 

the electricity consumption.

By establishing the “Management + Technology + Procedure” system, we have successfully improved our energy 

use efficiency, thereby achieving our targets (shown in the Environmental Targets section).

Our  efforts  in  energy-saving  at  office  buildings  have  earned  certifications  of  international  sustainable  design 

standards. Tencent Binhai Towers, Tencent Beijing Headquarters, and Chengdu Tencent Towers A and B have 

obtained LEED Gold or Platinum certifications.

Energy Management in Data Centres

We have always focused our efforts on improving resource efficiency and increasing the proportion of renewable 

energy use in our data centres, which are pivotal to reducing our carbon footprint.

118

119

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

We consider the green aspects of our self-built data centres, beginning from site selection, design and technologies 

to operations and management systems. Each data centre implements the applicable resource conservation and 

emission regulation measures outlined in its Operational Policy, which includes reducing GHG emissions, water 

consumption, and the process to handle hazardous and non-hazardous waste appropriately. In terms of energy 

conservation, we implemented the following measures:

‧ 

In the site selection phase, we prioritise areas with abundant renewable and clean energy to power our data 

centres. For example, the sites in Zhangjiakou Huailai are rich in wind and solar resources, and the sites 

in  Qingyuan,  Chongqing,  and  Guian  have  strong  hydropower  and  other  forms  of  clean  energy.  With  the 

development of these data centres, we continue to invest in a wide range of renewable energy technologies, 

such as photovoltaic systems, hydropower, and wind power technologies.

‧  Regarding  innovative  designs  and  technologies,  Tencent’s  fourth-generation  T-block  data  centre  uses 

energy-saving  technologies  that  include  (i)  High  Voltage  Direct  Current  technology  for  electrical  systems, 

(ii) liquid cooling technology, and (iii) indirect evaporative cooling units. These have allowed us to lower the 

power usage effectiveness (“PUE”) to 1.063.

‧ 

In  terms  of  operations  and  management  systems,  our  proprietary  AI  platform  can  automatically  and 

accurately  monitor  energy  data  in  real-time  and  conduct  refined  classification,  statistics,  and  scientific 

modelling to provide emission reduction solutions.

To increase the proportion of renewable energy use, we actively participate in green power trading and explore 

distributed energy systems. In 2021, we explored the feasibility of green power trading with our newly assembled 

team of green energy professionals. In September 2021, we made our first attempt in purchasing 60 million kWh 

hydropower for our Chongqing Cloud Data Centre, allowing the data centre to be supported by 100% renewable 

energy from August to December 2021. At the Tencent Qingyuan Qingxin Data Centre campus, we built a rooftop 

photovoltaic  power  generation  system  that  has  generated  over  2  million  kWh  of  electricity  from  September  to 

December 2021.

In terms of building green data centres, we have completed environmental impact assessments on all self-built 

data centres and have obtained approvals or filings in accordance with the Law of the People’s Republic of China 

on Environmental Impact Appraisal. We also pursued third-party building certifications to validate our commitment. 

In 2021, Tencent Tianjin Data Centre earned a LEED Platinum certification.

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

6.3  Waste Management

In response to the national call and local policy on garbage classification, we reinforced recycling practices by 

educating  our  employees  on  waste  management.  On-site  inspections  are  performed  to  ensure  proper  garbage 

classification. Waste generated in office buildings is categorised and transferred to a government-authorised waste 

treatment agency. In 2021, we strengthened the waste management of Tencent-owned offices by tracking and 

monitoring our generated waste.

We have implemented an electronic waste recycling and disposal programme at our data centres. The programme 

first examines whether old servers can be reused before they are dissembled. Otherwise, obsolete servers and 

other  electronic  waste,  including  waste  computers,  notebooks  and  monitors  will  be  recycled  and  reused  by 

qualified second-hand vendors.

We  have  entered  into  agreements  that  guarantee  100%  of  our  hazardous  waste  will  be  handled  in  strict 

compliance with relevant regulations. These types of wastes include lead-acid accumulators and destroyed hard 

drive components from data centres and waste toner and waste ink cartridges from office printers.

6.4  Water and Other Emission Management

Our impacts on the environment and natural resources primarily come from greenhouse gas emissions, energy 

consumption and waste production, where relevant policies and measures can be found in the previous sections. 

This section elucidates our strategies around water and other emission management.

We  have  implemented  water-saving  measures  across  our  office  buildings,  including  utilising  water-saving 

appliances,  monitoring  daily  water  consumption,  setting  water-use  targets,  and  educating  employees  on  water 

conservation. To accelerate the efforts around water conservation at our data centres, we are preparing to kickstart 

a few research projects on water cooling and recycling.

For Tencent Binhai Towers and Beijing Headquarters, we monitor the levels of air pollutants, including PM2.5, 

PM10, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide inside and outside the buildings with an online monitoring system, 

which  is  backed  up  by  a  manual  measuring  system.  A  smart  ventilation  system  is  installed  to  respond  to  the 

changing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide levels in our underground car park and office spaces. For our office 

cafeterias, the cooking ventilation comprises a fire-resistant environmental exhaust hood that removes oil droplets, 

activated carbon filtration and air ionisation.

Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Note:

1. 

Due to the nature of the business, the material air emissions of the Company are GHG emissions, arising from fuels and 

purchased electricity produced from fossil fuels.

2. 

We expand the 2021 reporting scope of our environmental performance to cover all office buildings and data centres in 

the Mainland of China and Hong Kong within our operational control. Leased data centres that we do not have operational 

control are excluded. The reporting scope of 2020 covered only the main office buildings and main data centres in the 

Mainland  of  China.  We  adjusted  the  reporting  scope  to  align  with  industry  best  practices;  such  an  adjustment  is  the 

primary driver against the year-on-year increases of the environmental performance reported, while another key driver is 

the organic growth of our businesses.

3. 

GHG inventory includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. GHG emissions data as at 31 December 2021 is 

presented in carbon dioxide equivalent. The GHG calculation methodology has been updated based on the 2006 IPCC 

Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), 

the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and the provincial electricity emission factors published by the Ministry of Ecology and 

Environment of China.

4. 

The adjusted Scope 2 emissions in 2020 is 1.71 million MtCO2e by applying the 2021 reporting scope. 

5. 

Scope  3  emissions  are  calculated  based  on  broad-based  assumptions  with  emission  factors  published  in  the UK 

Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and EPA Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated 

Database. The carbon footprint of leased data centres both in China and international markets, where we do not have 

operational control, is included in Scope 3 accounting.

6. 

Hazardous wastes produced at office buildings mainly includes waste toner cartridges and waste ink cartridges from our 

printers. Hazardous wastes produced by data centres mainly includes waste lead-acid accumulators and destroyed hard 

drive components.

7. 

In 2021, we reported the actual weight of garbage collected at our office buildings and have enhanced waste accounting 

for non-hazardous wastes. The garbage in 2020 was estimated with reference to the Handbook on Domestic Discharge 

Coefficients for Towns in the First Nationwide Census on Contaminant Discharge published by the State Council of the 

People’s Republic of China in 2008. Non-hazardous wastes produced by data centres mainly includes obsolete servers.

8. 

Total  energy  consumption  is  calculated  based  on  the  data  of  purchased  electricity  and  fuel  with  reference  to  the 

coefficients  in  the National Standards of the PRC General Principles for Calculation of the Comprehensive Energy 

Consumption (GB/T 2589-2020).

9. 

Diesel is consumed by backup power generators.

10. 

The adjusted total indirect energy consumption in 2020 is 3,128,144 MWh by applying the 2021 reporting scope.

124

125

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

11.  PUE of data centres is a ratio of the total energy consumption to the energy consumption of IT equipment. During the 

reporting period, the annual average PUE is calculated by considering all data centres within our operational control that 

have operated for more than 12 months with a minimum utilisation rate of 30%.

12.  Water supply mainly comes from the municipal water supply and there is no issue in sourcing water. In January 2021, 

we  upgraded  our  capability  in  water  management  at  our  office  buildings  with  the  introduction  of  the  Tencent  Facility 

Management system, which allowed us to track, record and analyse water consumption data every month. This upgrade 

will lay a solid foundation for our expanded reporting scope in the future. Comparable historical numbers are not available 

as we have only partly collected data at some of our leased sites, where the water usage was managed by third-party 

property management companies in 2020.

13.  Data regarding packaging materials are not applicable to the Company.

7.  OUR PEOPLE

Employees are the most valuable asset of Tencent. We believe that fostering a sustainable working environment and 

investing in the development of our employees are crucial to maintaining the long-term competitiveness of the Company. 

Our employment practices comply with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, as well as applicable local laws 

and regulations in the markets where we operate.

7.1  Rights and Benefits

Labour Practices

Our employment practice complies with relevant national and regional legislations such as the Labour Law of the 

People’s Republic of China on working hours, training, social insurance and welfare, and health and safety. We 

offer a flexible work schedule for our employees so that they can achieve greater work-life balance and autonomy. 

We strictly prohibit child labour and any forms of forced labour. All applicants are asked to provide proof of their 

educational backgrounds, qualifications, and work experiences. To ensure the legitimacy of the information, a due 

diligence agent will review and verify the details. Our Group Procurement Department requires suppliers to sign 

the Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment and operate  in accordance with our requirements concerning 

child labour and forced labour. In the case of any violation of the rules, measures and investigations will be taken 

immediately in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. In 2021, there were no violations related to 

child labour and forced labour.

We  value  our  relationship  with  our  employees  and  handle  employee  departure  strictly  in  accordance  with  the 

applicable local laws and regulations. An exit interview is conducted with each departing employee to understand 

the reasons for their departure and where we can improve as an employer.

124

125

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

In  addition  to  regulatory  requirements,  the  protection  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  have  been 

codified  and  enforced  through  our  internal  policies,  including  the Sunshine Code.  We  condemn  and  prohibit 

discrimination against any employees and job applicants on the basis of their nationality, race, religion, sex (sexual 

orientation and gender identity), age, or disability.

Our  corporate  culture  supports  diversity  and  inclusion.  Employees  and  management  are  provided  with  cross-

cultural training and workshops. To foster a community where women can be empowered by each other, we have 

launched the Women’s Leadership and Empowerment initiative, which calls on outstanding female employees to 

share their stories in the workplace. In 2021, we collaborated with the United Nations Development Programme 

(“UNDP”) to produce inspiring videos and articles about women in the technology industry. By the end of 2021, 

25% of our managerial positions were held by female employees. We are committed to inspiring and promoting 

women in leadership across multiple functions and management levels.

We  support  employees  who  are  starting  a  family  with  appropriate  benefits,  including  maternity/paternity  leave, 

breastfeeding leave, parental leave, flexible working hours, maternity allowance and family insurance.

We  provide  applicants  and  employees  access  to  grievance  procedures,  where  job  applicants  can  raise  issues 

related  to  discrimination  through  surveys  after  interviews,  and  employees  can  report  workplace  discrimination 

through  email  and  our  internal  grievance  platform.  In  case  of  such  a  report,  an  independent  investigation  will 

follow, and remedies will be implemented accordingly.

In 2021, we received the annual China’s Best Employer Award organised by Zhaopin and Peking University Social 

Survey Research Centre, and the Most Caring Employer for Women Award by Lagou.com, a popular job-seeking 

platform in China.

Compensation and Benefits

We  offer  our  employees  an  equitable  and  competitive  compensation  and  benefits  package.  It  aims  to  attract, 

motivate, and retain talents as they develop their long-term career with the Company. Our remuneration and bonus 

system, which includes salary, special and year-end bonuses, and share option and share reward schemes, is 

performance-based and designed to reward employees for their outstanding performance.

The primary benefits system complies with the relevant laws, regulations, and current market practices. On this 

basis, we offer a well-established and distinctive welfare programme for employees.

126

127

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Under our leave scheme, employees can enjoy fully-paid annual leave and sick leave, half-paid personal leave, 

and a fully-paid Chinese New Year leave, which are above the statutory standards. New fathers and mothers are 

entitled to take fully-paid paternity or maternity leave. For parents with children under the age of three, our updated 

leave scheme provides fully-paid parental leave each year. In addition, all employees are entitled to one day of 

fully-paid volunteer leave per year.

We have put in place housing benefit programmes, namely the Tencent Anju Plan and Yiju Plan. Since 2011, 

Tencent  Anju  Plan  has  provided  interest-free  loans  to  certain  employees  in  the  Mainland  of  China,  where  the 

skyrocketing property price misinformation has placed a lot of pressure on first-time home buyers. The Yiju Plan, 

launched in 2016, provides recent graduates with a rental subsidy to help reduce their financial burden as they 

start  their  careers.  In  2021,  we  raised  the  upper  limit  of  interest-free  loans  under  the  Tencent  Anju  Plan  and 

increased the rental subsidy under the Tencent Yiju Plan.

In November 2021, we announced the introduction of a new benefit scheme to reward long-serving employees to 

be implemented in 2022. On top of the statutory retirement plan, our employees will be provided with a package 

which  includes  customised  souvenirs,  a  long-service  gratuity,  and  a  retirement  honorarium  when  they  legally 

retire from Tencent. Incumbent employees who have served the Company for over 5 years will be provided with 

long-term health insurance. Incumbent employees who have worked for over 10 years will be given customised 

souvenirs and an additional 10-day leave. Incumbent employees who have worked for over 15 years will be offered 

lifetime health insurance and the option to retire early with a retirement package. Employees who have worked for 

over 20 years will receive a tailor-made commemoration gift package and customised employee badge.

We strive to provide employees with a wide variety of health-related benefits. For more details related to the specific 

benefits, please refer to the “Health and Safety” section.

Communication

We engage with our employees through various communication channels, including annual gatherings, internal 

forums and emails. Our objective is to foster a culture where employees are encouraged to freely express their 

views.  We  also  respond  and  address  employees’  concerns  throughout  their  career  development  and  learning 

process.  Every  year,  we  conduct  a  company-wide  anonymous  employee  engagement  and  satisfaction  survey 

through  an  independent  third-party  agency.  Based  on  the  survey  analysis,  our  Human  Resources  Department 

works with managers to develop action plans to strengthen the overall performance and development accordingly. 

In 2021, a total of 46,437 employees responded to the annual survey, which revealed greater engagement and 

overall satisfaction rates. The top three aspects employees were most satisfied with were “Culture/Values”, “Tech 

for  Good”,  and  “Company’s  Future  Development”.  For  three  consecutive  years,  “Culture/Values”  received  the 

highest recognition from our employees, scoring over 85% satisfaction rate. 

126

127

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

7.2  Growth and Development

We provide a career development system and professional training for our employees as they build their careers 

at Tencent. In 2019, we updated our Employee Career Development Management Policy to better support the 

development of our employees.

Career Path System

There are two internal career development channels, namely a professional channel and a management channel. 

The professional channel branches out to multiple fields of expertise, and each field further diversifies into various 

development paths with built-in tiers of seniority. The management channel is more streamlined. Our employees 

can choose to take the development channel that is most suitable for their career at Tencent. These approaches 

enable our employees to develop their careers in a thoughtful manner and be recognised for their contributions to 

the Company.

We  have  also  built  a  mechanism  for  employees  who  wish  to  pursue  a  new  direction  in  their  careers  within 

Tencent’s diverse business portfolio. Huoshui Programme (“HSP”), an internal talent transfer portal, was launched 

in 2012. Employees can apply for a role across various functions and regions after their first year of employment. In 

2021, HSP facilitated over 4,000 internal transfers. It greatly boosted the vitality of the Company as it brought more 

talents from different backgrounds to our core products and fast-growing businesses. For those who are planning 

to relocate to another city or country, HSP can be an alternative option for them without leaving the Company. Our 

effective talent allocation programme was used as a case study by the Harvard Business School previously and 

was included in the case library of Tsinghua School of Economics and Management in 2021.

Training Programmes

Established  in  2007,  Tencent  Academy  runs  a  suite  of  training  programmes  such  as  on-boarding,  on-the-job 

training and leadership training to support employees at every stage of their careers. As employees gradually gain 

work experience and promotion opportunities, we offer them a curated series of relevant courses to complement 

their development and learning goals. The Academy also offers employees qualification programmes and monetary 

rewards for those who have successfully obtained certifications. In addition to on-site training, Tencent Academy 

also provides an online learning platform that enables employees to learn anytime, anywhere.

To help employees of different positions address various professional needs, Tencent Academy offers courses on 

products, operational skills, technology, data analysis, marketing, design, risk management, customer engagement, 

and many more. As of 2021, Tencent Academy has offered 784 types of courses, of  which 111 of them were 

recently added. These courses were offered all year round and added up to 12,000 classes in total. The average 

training hours and participation rate were over 40 hours and 99.61% respectively. 

128

129

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Tencent Academy invited experts to share their knowledge on scientific innovation, technology, and product design 

at the Tencent Technology Week in October 2021 and Tencent Design Week in December 2021, as well as other 

professional events. We believe that these opportunities can inspire and help employees gain new perspectives 

for their personal growth. In the spirit of sharing, we have an internal interactive platform for senior employees 

or domain experts to share their experiences with employees. To promote capacity building within our industry’s 

value chain, we have made some of our training resources available to certain business partners and investee 

companies.

Performance Evaluation and Promotion

To  encourage  continuous  growth  and  development,  employees  receive  regular  objective  and  fair  assessments 

regarding  their  performance.  A  merit-based  incentive  and  performance  management  system  are  in  place  to 

streamline our assessment processes and ensure consistency across the Company. Employees are expected to 

write their self-evaluation twice per year, followed by comprehensive feedback provided by their direct supervisor. 

In addition to the bi-annual evaluation, we encourage supervisors to communicate with their subordinates regularly 

in order to help employees grow and succeed.

Employees  may  apply  for  promotion  after  their  interim  and  year-end  performance  reviews,  provided  that  they 

satisfy the requirements with regard to the length of service and performance. Depending on the work scope, the 

promotion will be reviewed and considered by the relevant internal committee.

In case of disagreement on the performance and promotion assessment results, employees can appeal through 

our  grievance  procedure  and  request  a  re-assessment  via  our  independent  internal  promotion  management 

platform.

In  2021,  we  increased  the  transparency  of  the  review  process  by  encouraging  colleagues  to  attend  promotion 

presentations given by individuals from similar professions. We believe the events can help employees develop a 

deeper understanding of relevant career trajectories and requirements.

7.3  Health and Safety

We are committed to supporting the well-being of our employees. To prevent accidents and reduce occupational 

hazards in the workplace, we have established a framework that complies with international guidelines, applicable 

laws, and regulations, such as the Guidelines on Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems by the 

International Labour Organisation and Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of 

Occupational Diseases.  We  have  employed  a Safety Management Policy  and Public Emergency Management 

Policy.

128

129

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

To  maintain  a  safe  and  comfortable  workplace,  we  have  a  security  system,  fire  safety  system,  and  food  safety 

monitoring system in place. We invite third parties to conduct security risk audits on our premises every year to 

identify hardware defects and deficiencies in the operation management system and address other hidden risks.

We  attend  to  the  health  and  well-being  of  our  employees  by  investing  in  various  resources,  including  annual 

medical check-ups, health seminars, fitness and mindfulness sessions, on-site as well as in-person counselling for 

physical and mental health, and 24-hour telephone support from relevant professionals.

We  also  organise  a  wide  variety  of  recreational  clubs,  such  as  running,  photography,  music,  dance,  language 

classes,  and  celebratory  activities,  including  work  anniversaries  and  festival  celebrations  for  our  employees. 

Wherever feasible, we reserve dedicated spaces for recreational facilities on our campuses. For example, in our 

Shenzhen  Headquarters,  we  have  built  a  300-meter  running  track,  an  indoor  rock-climbing  wall,  table  tennis 

tables, pool tables, a badminton court and a basketball court.

There  are  various  kinds  of  insurance  available  for  employees,  including  social  insurance,  commercial  medical 

insurance, critical illness insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, and many more.

We formulate detailed emergency plans for fire safety, natural disasters, personal injury and other life-threatening 

events,  and  conduct  regular  drills  and  simulation  tests.  In  response  to  medical  emergencies  in  the  workplace, 

we  have  formed  an  internal  emergency  rescue  team  and  provided  employees  with  first-aid  training.  We  have 

approximately 400 automated external defibrillators (“AED”) across our 50-plus offices and data centres. In 2021, 

our  internal  first-aid  team  hosted  150  in-person  first-aid  training  sessions  for  5,498  participants  and  provided 

online first-aid training courses to 13,838 participants.

Over the past year, COVID-19 outbreaks resurged globally, bringing suffering to people and forcing local economies 

to a halt. We continue to closely monitor the pandemic and inform employees to quarantine or work from home, if 

needed. Surgical masks, hand disinfectants and personal protective equipment are provided at our offices, and to 

employees in need. A continuously updated Tencent COVID-19 Response Guideline is used to provide guidance on 

office management and promote anti-pandemic awareness among employees. We apply strict practices to ensure 

a  safe  working  environment,  including  enhanced  cleaning  and  sanitation  procedures,  temperature  monitoring, 

social distancing, and other measures that can minimise transmission risks.

We uphold the value of integrity, proactivity, cooperation, and creativity in our business operation. We comply with all 

applicable laws and regulations to ensure sustainable development. To achieve business stability, we uphold ourselves to 

the business ethics and practise risk prevention and control.

8.1  Anti-Corruption

We  have  developed  robust  systems  and  measures  to  prevent,  detect,  and  deter  corruption,  bribery,  or  other 

fraudulent activities while promoting integrity. High-risk business activities and management are subject to periodic 

audits to assess the effectiveness of the internal control system and ensure the Group complies with the ethical 

standards that we strive to uphold.

According to the Law Against Unfair Competition in the PRC, business operators shall not use monies, assets, 

or  other  means  to  bribe  an  entity  or  individuals  to  obtain  transaction  opportunities  or  competitive  advantage. 

According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, corruption and bribery may constitute a serious 

criminal offence. We strictly comply with the local anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations.

Risk Management and Internal Control Policy

In  2016,  we  updated  the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy  (the  “Risk Management Policy”)  and 

established a system comprising of three risk management lines of defence.

‧ 

The first line of defence consists of business and functional departments. We provide targeted training and 

guidance for relevant employees to help them identify potential risks in their daily work and report such risks 

to their superiors.

‧ 

The second line of defence comprises of the IC. It establishes a list of major risks at the business level by 

collecting, summarising, analysing various data, and ensuring that appropriate risk response strategies and 

monitoring measures have been taken. The management first reviews the information. Then, it is submitted 

to the Audit Committee for further revision before reporting to the Board. The IC performs timely analysis 

and evaluation on the response to major risks and reports the results to the Audit Committee quarterly. The 

Board entrusts the Audit Committee to (i) assess the nature and extent of the risks the Company is willing to 

accept to achieve its corporate objectives, (ii) determine the major risk response strategies and responsible 

departments, and (iii) promote the implementation of the response strategies from top-down, supported by 

the IC.

‧ 

The third line of defence is made up of the IA and the Anti-Fraud Investigation Department. The IA is highly 

independent and responsible for providing independent evaluation and assurance regarding the effectiveness 

of the Company’s risk management and internal control system. It supervises the management team and 

helps them improve their risk management and internal monitoring capability. The Anti-Fraud Investigation 

Department  is  responsible  for  receiving  reports  from  various  channels  and  investigating  suspected  fraud 

cases. It also assists the management in advocating integrity values by ensuring all employees understand 

and  fully  acknowledge  the Sunshine Code.  Both  the  Internal  Audit  and  the  Anti-Fraud  Investigation 

Departments report directly to the Audit Committee.

Through the three lines of defence, we regularly provide targeted risk control training for employees from different 

positions and businesses to enhance their overall awareness of risk management.

134

135

The Risk Management Policy sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in risk management 

and control (including those in relation to fraud). Such Policy emphasises that each business group is primarily 

responsible for its department’s risk management and internal control. If any fraudulent activity is detected, the 

management of the relevant department shall improve their control procedures promptly to prevent the recurrence 

of similar incidents. In 2021, our Anti-Fraud Investigation Department found more than 50 cases in violation of 

Tencent’s “high voltage line”. Approximately 70 people have been dismissed, amongst which more than 10 people 

suspected of crimes have been reported to relevant government authorities in accordance with applicable laws and 

regulations.

Sunshine Code and Anti-Corruption Training

All employees of the Group are required to strictly follow and comply with the Sunshine Code. It prohibits all kinds 

of fraudulent activities, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of the Company’s assets, extortion, falsification 

of information and any other activities that are not in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. The 

Sunshine Code is reviewed annually and updated against the ever-changing needs of the Group as appropriate. 

That way, it could cater to our business development, reflect the applicable laws and regulations, and capture all 

kinds of fraudulent activities. Our Sunshine Code was further enhanced in 2021 to (i) strengthen the enforcement 

and punishment of Code violations, and (ii) revise the conflict-of-interest parameters.

In  order  to  educate  our  employees  about  anti-corruption  behaviours,  we  have  provided  them  with  mandatory 

training  on  our Sunshine Code.  We  promote  anti-corruption  through  emails,  elevator  pitch  videos,  and  other 

internal  communication  channels.  In  2021,  we  updated  the Sunshine Code  related  online  video  courses  and 

required  the  participation  of  all  employees  of  the  Group.  For  new  hires  and  employees  in  sensitive  positions, 

we  have  provided  them  with  a  total  of  76  face-to-face  anti-fraud  training  courses,  covering  more  than  10,000 

participants. In 2021, 100% of our employees have received anti-corruption training.

In 2021, five directors participated in either the Audit Committee meeting, internal audit committee meeting, other 

internal meetings, or study the Sunshine Code related online video courses to learn about the Risk Management 

Policy, anti-fraud policies and measures, anti-corruption related laws and regulations, the Sunshine Code, as well 

as internal corruption cases.

Anti-Fraud and Whistleblowing Policy

We  have  published  an Anti-Fraud and Whistleblowing Policy  (the  “Whistleblowing Policy”),  which  conveys  the 

message  of  our  zero-tolerance  in  relation  to  fraudulent  activities  for  all  the  employees  and  suppliers/business 

partners. The Group encourages employees and suppliers/business partners to report any concerns that they may 

have regarding any non-compliant or potentially fraudulent activities. The Whistleblowing Policy outlines multiple 

whistleblowing  channels  and  our  whistle-blower  protection  system.  We  protect  the  safety  of  whistle-blowers  by 

ensuring that they do not receive unfair treatment or any form of retaliation during the process. Since 2016, we 

have used our Weixin Official Account, “Sunshine Tencent” to raise employee’s awareness of anti-fraud policies 

and whistleblowing channels and provide our suppliers/business partners a means to file a formal report directly.

Employees, suppliers/business partners and other stakeholders can also report other violations (including but not 

limited to employees’ misconduct, deception, disclosure of trade secrets, or other breaches of business ethics) 

through our open channels. We encourage the informants to leave their contact information so that we can conduct 

follow-up investigations and provide them with updates on the progress. We guarantee that anonymous reports 

that provide adequate information will be dealt with seriously. We guarantee the confidentiality of the submitted 

information and the informant’s identity and take measures to protect the informant from retaliation.

Fraud Detection and Corruption Prevention

When  suspected  fraudulent  activities  are  discovered  or  when  a  report  of  suspected  fraudulent  activities  is 

received, the Anti-Fraud Investigation Department (consisting of professionals who used to be a part of the anti-

corruption function at a governmental authority or private enterprise and have profound knowledge in fraud risk 

management and investigation) is assigned to handle the investigation independently. After the investigation has 

been completed, the employee found and proven to have committed fraud shall be subject to immediate dismissal. 

The department in question must, with the assistance of the IC, take corrective actions in response to the business 

risk or loophole identified during the investigation. If we find that any suppliers or business partners have engaged 

in serious corruption or fraudulent activities, we will terminate the contracts immediately and will never conduct 

business with them. In the event that any fraudulent activity violates any relevant laws or regulations, such cases 

shall be reported to appropriate government authorities. In 2021, we received the results of the four corruption-

related cases (including cases we transferred in previous years) that we have transferred to the authorities. Six 

employees who were involved were dismissed and have faced criminal punishment. Because these cases were 

discovered and handled in time, they did not incur much impact on the Company’s business. After the occurrence 

of these cases, according to the Sunshine Code, the direct and indirect managers of the employees involved bore 

the management responsibilities and consequences, such as reprimand, decrease in performance appraisal rating, 

demotion, dismissal and termination of labour contract. Relevant departments have also taken effective internal 

control measures to prevent similar cases from recurring.

136

137

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

With  the Management Policy for Sensitive Positions  (the  “Management Policy”)  in  place,  we  strengthened  the 

construction of the Company’s integrity system by improving our corporate governance standards and supervision 

requirements  on  risk  management  and  internal  control.  The Management Policy  also  defines  which  positions 

are regarded as sensitive, including those that are involved in procurement (supplies, services, and resources), 

marketing,  channel  sales  and  resource  management,  external  events,  evaluation  and  selection  of  potential 

partners, pricing, resource allocation, key decision-making and other high-risk duties. Corresponding management 

measures are taken for these positions, including requiring regular job rotation, stripping sensitive responsibilities, 

participating in various risk management training. The Management Policy also stipulates that the IA reserves the 

right to audit all sensitive personnel positions and may conduct audits on current or former personnel in sensitive 

positions at any time.

Our stance against fraud is clear. In order to convey a message regarding our determination to fight against fraud 

and introduce our Whistleblowing Policy externally, we sent a letter to our suppliers and business partners and 

requested  them  to  complete  a  questionnaire  annually  since  2015.  The  questionnaire  delineates  our  corporate 

values, the Whistleblowing Policy and various reporting channels. By doing so, we learn from our suppliers and 

business partners whether our employees have requested any gifts, cash, or other benefits and whether they have 

been  mistreated during the course of business. Upon receiving the  feedback,  we  ensure that  the  questions  or 

concerns raised by our suppliers and our business partners are addressed promptly. The Anti-Fraud Investigation 

Department will commence a formal investigation when necessary.

Our IC has established a procurement management control unit to optimise the Group’s Supplier Management 

System.  Through  the  centralised  system,  the  bidding  process  can  be  more  standardised  and  transparent.  The 

Supplier  Management  System  also  provides  communication  channels  for  suppliers  to  collect  their  feedback  or 

complaints. Fraud complaints will be directly transferred to  the Anti-Fraud Investigation Department for follow-

up. The goal is to ensure that suppliers’ complaints and concerns can be resolved in a timely manner, thereby 

minimising the risk of fraud.

8.2  Anti-Trust

We are committed to competing in a fair way and respecting the relevant anti-trust laws and regulations of the 

jurisdictions where we operate our business. In China, we are committed to complying with the Anti-monopoly Law 

of the People’s Republic of China, which took effect on 1 August 2008, the Anti-monopoly Guidelines of the Anti-

monopoly Commission of the State Council on Platform Economy promulgated on 7 February 2021,  and  other 

antitrust-related laws, regulations and guidelines.

We advocate fair competition and have issued the Corporation Fair Competition Guidelines since 2016. It contains 

a  comprehensive  introduction  to  the Anti-monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China,  the  implementing 

regulations,  and  the  enforcement  practices.  It  also  sets  out  compliance  requirements  corresponding  to  our 

business practices. It serves as the basic guide to assist relevant employees in following the rules of fair competition 

and  conducting  business  activities  in  conformity  with  these  laws  and  regulations.  In  2016,  we  established  a 

Competition Policy Office, a specialised department with professional lawyers in charge of anti-trust compliance 

matters.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  we  are  among  the  first  in  the  industry  to  establish  such  a  specialised 

department.

In 2021, we further enhanced our anti-trust compliance system, which focuses on the following three main areas:

‧ 

Establish a new specialised compliance department and strengthen daily compliance initiatives

In terms of organisational structure, in 2021, we set up a specialised Anti-Monopoly Compliance Department 

(“AMCD”)  that  reports  regularly  to  the  senior  management.  The  AMCD  coordinates  with  relevant  teams 

and resources to strengthen our anti-trust compliance. The AMCD’s work scope includes (i) providing anti-

monopoly  compliance  advice  on  daily  operation,  (ii)  conducting  merger  filings,  (iii)  following  up  with  the 

domestic and global anti-monopoly legislation, rule-making progress, enforcement and judicial initiatives and 

analysing impacts on the operation, (iv) training on anti-trust compliance, and (v) actively cooperating with 

anti-trust regulators’ requirements, if any. Our AMCD works closely with different business groups and other 

stakeholders to continuously improve the formulation and implementation of the relevant compliance policies 

and mechanisms (including but not limited to the daily compliance initiatives and merger filings). We aim to 

strengthen our anti-trust compliance and help maintain a fair and competitive environment.

138

139

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

‧ 

Update anti-trust compliance guidelines for business

In the spirit of enhancing internal anti-trust scrutiny, we have upgraded and optimised our anti-monopoly 

compliance  system.  In  accordance  with  the  latest  anti-trust  legislation,  law  enforcement  and  judicial 

practices, we made revisions to the 2016 Corporation Fair Competition Guidelines and upgraded it to the 

Group’s Anti-trust Compliance Guidelines  in  2021.  For  instance,  the  updated  Guidelines  provide  more 

specific compliance guidance for different business scenarios by referring to typical cases published by the 

authorities.

‧ 

Strengthen anti-trust compliance training and advocacy

We continue to strengthen the relevant compliance training across the Group. The training scheme aims 

to  continually  enhance  employees’  awareness  around  anti-trust  law  compliance.  We  have  also  invited 

professionals to host anti-trust related seminars to further advocate anti-trust compliance.

In the future, Tencent will continue to actively engage with the regulatory authorities and comply with relevant anti-

trust laws and regulations.

8.3  Anti-Money Laundering

The  Group  strictly  abides  by  applicable  laws  and  regulations  related  to  anti-money  laundering  (“AML”)  and 

counter-terrorist  financing  (“CTF”)  in  the  PRC  and  other  countries  and  regions  in  which  we  provide  payment 

processing  services.  We  monitor  regulatory  changes  and  respond  in  a  timely  manner  by  engaging  in  legal 

interpretation, gap analysis and training, as well as with the assistance of external consultants. We fulfil all relevant 

regulatory  obligations  under  such  applicable  rules  and  regulations  including  but  not  limited  to  the Anti-Money 

Laundering Law of the People’s Republic of China and Administrative Measures for Anti-Money Laundering and 

Anti-Terrorism Financing of Payment Institutions.

138

139

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

In view of the complex legal and regulatory compliance landscape across multiple jurisdictions, we continue to 

improve our money laundering risk management.

‧ 

In  2021,  we  updated  our  policy  and  released  the  second  version  of Tencent’s Minimum Standards for 

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Compliance.  The  revised  standard  closely  follows  domestic  and 

global  regulatory  requirements  and  trends.  It  also  re-examines  the  AML  control  measures  based  on  the 

development of the Group’s business and products.

‧ 

The  Group’s  Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Sanctions  Compliance  Department  is  responsible  for  (i) 

coordinating the management of money laundering and sanctions risk at the Group level for all businesses, 

(ii) fulfilling AML and sanctions requirements under relevant laws and regulations, and (iii) managing and 

promoting the implementation of various AML and sanctions initiatives.

We have also published the Tencent Anti-Money Laundering Policy Statement and the Tencent Sanctions Policy 

Statement on the Corporate Governance page of the Company Website.

In 2021, we sought strict compliance with all applicable AML and sanctions requirements and promoted initiatives 

under the framework of the Tencent’s Minimum Standards for Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Compliance. 

We  will  continue  to  (i)  increase  staffing  and  better  equip  the  team  via  on-the-job  and  professional  training 

periodically; (ii) improve and update our internal system and processes to comprehensively address all applicable 

regulatory requirements; (iii) periodically carry out assessments on our systems and processes  to enhance  the 

implementation of AML and sanctions compliance, including customer and product risk assessment, transaction 

monitoring and suspicious transaction report compliance assessment, and list management systems inspection; 

(iv) deepen cooperation with authorities to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing; and (v) actively 

participate in international AML and CTF events to exchange industry best practices.

8.4  Supply Chain Management

Having a sustainable supply chain is one of the fundamental factors for ensuring long-term business growth. We 

have  formulated  the Tencent Supplier Management Policy together  with  the  Supplier  Management  System  to 

provide effective and standardised management of our suppliers.

The  Supplier  Management  Policy  stipulates  the  requirements  and  practices  for  supplier  legal  and  regulatory 

compliance, supplier selection and evaluation. The Policy is also set to manage the ethical risks associated with 

the relationships between our procurement employees and business partners. The Policy and the Sunshine Code 

specify standardised processes for procurement employees when engaging in procurement activities. Suppliers 

are required to declare any relationship they may have with our employees in written form. Suppliers must agree 

to the terms of the Anti-Commercial Bribery Declaration, which requires suppliers to conduct business with the 

Company in an ethical manner. As of 31 December 2021, all suppliers have been required to comply with the 

Tencent Supplier Management Policy, and all suppliers in the Mainland of China have been required to sign the 

Anti-Commercial Bribery Declaration.

The online Supplier Management System is used for managing qualified suppliers and the procurement lifecycle. 

It  covers  the  aspects  of  finding  and  selecting  suppliers,  evaluating  supplier  performance,  and  terminating  the 

engagement of suppliers. All details are recorded within the system.

‧ 

Supplier selection: We have an internal policy that sets out the procedures and mechanisms for supplier 

onboarding. The Procurement Department looks for qualified suppliers in the market and evaluates offers 

based  on  the  duration  of  the  cooperation,  order  volume,  and  nature  of  the  request.  In  principle,  we  will 

ask  for  price  quotations  from  at  least  three  vendors  whilst  considering  factors  such  as  the  delivery  time, 

operational  and  technical  capabilities,  and  environmental  and  social  responsibilities.  If  there  is  only  one 

vendor available for selection as it dominates the relevant market or it is the only vendor with access to the 

required goods or services, the particular procurement arrangement will require special approval along with 

a  sufficient  and  reasonable  justification.  Before  engaging  with  a  supplier,  we  will  conduct  due  diligence, 

including qualification checks and site visits on the supplier. The findings and evaluation will be reported to 

the Procurement Department for final decision.

‧ 

Supplier  evaluation:  We  regularly  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  suppliers  and  take  appropriate  steps 

to  address  any  issues  concerning  the  quality  of  the  suppliers.  For  underperforming  suppliers,  subject 

to  applicable  contractual  arrangements,  we  may  (i)  discuss  with  them  about  their  remedial  plans,  (ii) 

suspend the cooperation, (iii) reduce the order volume, (iv) impose penalties, or (v) suspend payment. The 

Procurement Department may disqualify a supplier for the following events when (i) we suffer from material 

economic losses due to the delayed delivery, quality issue, or breach of contract by the supplier; (ii) the 

supplier has received the lowest rating on the rating scale for two consecutive quarters, and (iii) the supplier 

is in serious breach of business ethics.

140

141

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Suppliers, which the Group Procurement Department formally engages with, are also required to sign a Corporate 

Social Responsibility Commitment. It is a declaration that covers labour rights, child labour-free and forced labour-

free practices, health and safety, and environmental protection. We prioritise environmentally friendly products and 

services when selecting suppliers related to office buildings. We have required all property management companies 

of our self-owned office buildings to obtain the ISO 14001 environmental management system certification, which 

has been checked by the Administrative Department every year.

9.  PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

We strive to provide the best user experience with high-quality and reliable products and services. We focus our efforts 

on protecting data security and user privacy, product health and safety, customer complaints, advertising content and IP 

rights. We also conduct strict reviews of our products and services offered and related sales, marketing and advertising 

strategies and materials to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

9.1  User Privacy

At Tencent, user privacy and data security are our highest priorities. We believe that protecting the data privacy of 

our users is essential to creating a safe and market-leading user experience, and that users should be in control of 

their data and be well-informed of our data policies and practices. Our belief has followed through to our adoption 

of “Privacy by Design” and “Privacy by Default” when developing our products and services.

Management Approach

Security, autonomy, compliance, and transparency laid the foundation of our privacy protection policy. Tencent is 

privacy-focused on every level. Our dedicated privacy and legal teams work hand-in-hand with our product teams 

to ensure that our products and services are built with privacy in mind from the ground up, and comply with all 

applicable laws and regulations. Our product teams also work together with our engineering teams to ensure that 

our data collection and use practices for products and services are transparent, and that users have control over 

how their data is used.

We adhere to the following principles for user privacy protection and data security:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

Security  and  reliability.  We  work  to  prevent  user  data  leakage,  damage  and  loss  through  reasonable  and 

effective data security technology and management.

Independent choice. We provide convenient data management options for users to make appropriate choices 

and manage personal data.

Protect  communication  secrets.  We  strictly  abide  by  laws  and  regulations,  protect  users’  communication 

secrets and provide secure communication services.

‧  Reasonability and necessity. We only collect necessary data to provide better services to users.

‧ 

‧ 

Clarity and transparency. We strive to introduce the privacy policy on data processing to users in easy-to-

understand language.

Integrate privacy protection into product design.

Tencent complies with all applicable privacy protection and data security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions 

we operate. To ensure the Company’s products and business processes comply with the regulatory requirements, 

we  monitor  the  relevant  regulations  and  laws  in  China  and  international  markets  closely,  implement  such  new 

requirements and upgrade our know-how in a timely manner.

142

143

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Tencent acts in accordance with applicable laws and follows the following general principles whenever we receive 

requests to disclose data from government agencies and regulators:

‧  We respond to valid legal requests consistently and fairly across all jurisdictions where we offer our products 

and  services,  subject  to  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  our  interpretation  of  potential  differences 

between jurisdictions;

‧  Whenever  possible  and  subject  to  applicable  laws,  we  are  transparent  with  our  users  in  the  actions  that 

we take in response to valid legal requests, to provide affected users with an opportunity to respond to the 

request; and

‧  We carefully review all requests to ensure that we comply with all  applicable laws and  regulations in our 

response,  while  respecting  our  users’  rights.  That  may  include  taking  sufficient  internal  and  third-party 

professional advice.

Oversight

The Board and Management have always attached great importance to the protection of our users’ personal data. 

Tencent’s  Management  is  committed  to  a  privacy-first  governance  approach  and  has  institutionalised  a  robust 

internal evaluation process to ensure that all products are fully assessed to comply with all applicable data privacy 

laws and that all data collected are securely transmitted and stored. From top-down, to bottom-up, data privacy is 

an organisational effort.

144

145

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Approach and Procedures

We believe that users should be able to manage their own data. Therefore, our products and services are designed 

to the maximal extent that restricts the collection of and access to user data by Tencent or anyone else. While 

using our products and services, users can manage the scope and extent to which their data is collected, used, 

and shared. These features have been researched, designed, and implemented over many years in order to protect 

users’ privacy and allow them to directly manage their data.

Our approach to data protection follows the widely recognised “Privacy by Design” concept, which dictates that 

all our products and services are designed with privacy protection from the outset and that we continuously think 

about privacy protection throughout the product lifecycle. Our approach to “Privacy by Design” is encapsulated in 

three words: “Person-Button-Data”.

‧ 

“Person” refers to how the needs of our users are central to everything we do. Core to this is the notion of 

transparency and our commitment to letting users know how their data is used. Privacy remains our highest 

priority in all that we do. Users can manage their personal data, and we facilitate this in line with applicable 

laws  and  regulations.  We  only  collect  the  minimum  amount  of  data  required  to  power  our  products  and 

services. We do not provide users’ data to third parties without a clear legal basis, and users are informed as 

to what data is shared, how it is shared, and with whom it is shared.

‧ 

“Button” symbolises a reminder of our commitment to providing users with the ability to manage their data in 

an easy, seamless fashion - like the click of a button. Our products and services generally include a privacy 

control suite or centre where users are empowered to access their data, obtain a copy of their data, request 

for deletion of their data, or for its migration, in accordance with applicable laws.

‧ 

“Data” refers to user data we safeguard with our thorough and cutting-edge cybersecurity technology and 

management protocols. Our round-the-clock Security Platform Department comprises some of the world’s 

leading  data  security  experts  who  collaborate  with  external  security  researchers  and  partners  worldwide 

through our online Tencent Security Response Centre Platform to create a more robust and secure digital 

environment. Together, these provide world-class threat monitoring, defence, and response mechanisms to 

safeguard user data and enable prompt detection and remedy of security incidents.

Our Data Protection Officer undertakes the related responsibilities according to laws, including communicating 

with regulators and providing advice to management on related compliance requirements in different jurisdictions. 

The Data Protection Officer is supported by a team of qualified privacy protection professionals and is available 

to  address  any  questions  regarding  Tencent’s  privacy  practices,  or  any  product-specific  privacy  policy,  at 

Dataprotection@tencent.com.

144

145

Tencent Holdings LimitedAnnual Report 2021Environmental, Social and Governance Report

Privacy Impact Assessments and follow-up

As part of our privacy-focused work, we regularly undertake Privacy Impact Assessments (“PIAs”) for our products 

and services. These PIAs evaluate the privacy-related risks of our products and services in the relevant jurisdictions 

where we operate. Our dedicated privacy legal team is trained to identify, highlight, and manage privacy risks, 

minimise potential impacts to individual rights, and address other adverse privacy issues. 

Our privacy protection policy is also published on the product’s official website and app, which is also accessible 

on  the  Tencent  Privacy  Protection  Platform.  Users  can  also  submit  complaints  or  make  inquiries  through  the 

feedback button on the website, app and privacy feedback email (Dataprivacy@tencent.com).

Incident Management

Tencent has comprehensive systems in place to empower our teams to respond rapidly and effectively to all types 

of  information  security  incidents,  including  attacks  from  attrition,  ransomware,  the  web,  email,  impersonation, 

improper usage, system outages and deletion, loss, or theft of data. Our main goals are to continuously ensure the 

cybersecurity of our platforms, to protect the information entrusted to us by users, and to ensure our operations 

meet the applicable laws and regulations. We also use various incident analysis mechanisms and risk protocols to 

ensure that Tencent responds appropriately and swiftly to any threat detected.

Culture and Responsibility

We are committed to a privacy-conscious culture and making the protection of user privacy our top priority. We 

believe that ensuring privacy is a shared responsibility for all Tencent employees, regardless of their roles or ranks 

at  Tencent.  We  regularly  provide  comprehensive  and  company-wide  privacy  education  and  awareness  training 

programmes to all our employees. These programmes are designed to provide employees with an understanding 

of  general  privacy  and  data  protection  considerations,  including  “Privacy  Protection  in  Design”  and  “Privacy 

Protection by Default,” how to build privacy-centric user interfaces, how to identify privacy issues in mergers and 

acquisitions, how to respect the rights of data subjects and handle related requests, and the risks of cross-border 

data transfers. We systematically communicate our privacy protection and cybersecurity guidelines and procedures 

to all employees and strictly enforce safeguards across our products and services at all levels.

9.2  Data Security4

In September 2021, we established the Security Technology Committee to enhance the internal coordination of 

security technologies development and application. We have also strengthened  the  comprehensive  systems  by 

applying various incident analysis mechanisms and risk protocols, enabling us to respond to various information 

security threats and incidents appropriately and swiftly.

We  keep  the  personal  information  of  users  collected  and  used  during  the  provision  of  our  services  strictly 

confidential and shall not leak, distort, damage, sell or illegally provide such information to others. We establish 

and improve the user information protection system by hierarchically managing the access rights of internal staff to 

ensure data security and prevent any leakage, damage, or loss of information. We provide an easy-to-use channel 

for employees to look up the Company’s data security policy through internal communication tools to timely confirm 

whether their behaviour meets the Company’s security policy requirements. When employees discover potential 

data security violations, they can report the cases through the internal communication tools or reporting system; 

once the violations are verified, the Company will take strict disciplinary measures, including but not limited to 

notice of criticism and corresponding punishment. We provide privacy protection and data security training to all 

employees, including full-time, part-time and interns, to instill a long-term data security protection culture.

FinTech

We  provide  a  variety  of  security  solutions  for  enhancing  users’  account  security.  We  continue  to  conduct  self-

assessment,  optimisation  and  standardisation  of  our  financial  products  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws 

and  regulations,  including  the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Publicly-offered Securities 

Investment Fund Distributors, the Circular on Standardising the Retrospective Administration of Online Insurance 

Sales Practices,  and  the Measures for the Regulation of Internet Insurance Business.  Our  risk  control  system 

provides real-time monitoring 24/7 to ensure the safety of account funds. Users will be informed of any changes in 

the amount of funds immediately via mobile phone messages, email, and other means.

Tencent Cloud

Tencent Cloud has established an efficient internal control system and strengthened its foundation in data security 

from  the  aspects  of  system  process  and  control  activities.  Our  Cloud  Security  Management  System  has  also 

received accreditations globally.

We apply our internal best practices in data security to Tencent Cloud’s security products and services, including 

the intelligent gateway, cloud firewall, DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection, network intrusion protection, 

and anti-fraud. It has achieved all-rounded security by identifying and deploying protection measures on physical 

security,  virtualisation  security,  network  security,  host  security,  data  security,  application  security,  business 

security, security audit and security management. With the evolution of cloud computing and security technologies, 

Tencent Cloud will continue to build an efficient security internal control system, enhance security compliance 

capabilities, and upgrade cloud security and big data security standards.

9.3  User Protection

Protection of Minors

Tencent has always attached great importance to protecting and promoting the healthy development of Minors, 

which can be demonstrated through our products and services. We utilise technological innovations to upgrade 

the protection system for Minors and create a series of programmes to support their growth and development. With 

the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Minors that came into effect in June 2021, which 

stipulates the responsibilities and obligations of internet service providers, we have rolled out Minors protection 

programmes in our various products and fully implemented such measures as required.

As one of the leading companies in the game industry, Tencent is committed to creating a healthy game-playing 

environment for many years. In China, we work with the industry to explore various measures for building a healthy 

game-playing environment for Minors. We have implemented the real-name system and anti-addiction system in 

accordance with the regulatory requirements of the PRC. We have also leveraged various advanced technologies 

within the industry to further enhance our protection system for Minors. In recent years, we have introduced the 

following measures:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

Pioneered a system for parents to manage their children’s playtime in February 2017;

Introduced the strictest measures in the industry, with mandatory real-name verification and limits on game 

time and spending in September 2018;

Prevented in-game spending by players aged under 12 since August 2021;

‧  Minors can only play games between 8-9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and statutory holidays since 

1  September  2021.  Industry-leading  measures  were  taken  to  prevent  Minors  from  using  adult  accounts. 

For example, we (i) upgraded our screening system to identify misused adult accounts; and (ii) proactively 

cracked down on illegal transactions of adult accounts; and

‧ 

In the fourth quarter of 2021, total time spent by Minors reduced by 88% year-on-year and contributed 0.9% 

of the total time spent on our Domestic Games. Total grossing receipts from Minors reduced by 73% year-

on-year and contributed 1.5% of the total grossing receipts of our Domestic Games.

Besides the measures on healthy gameplay, we also pay close attention to the usage habits of the Minors in our 

entertainment and social products. We launched “underage mode” in a number of products, including but not 

limited  to  Tencent  Video,  Weishi,  and  Weixin,  or  developed  alternative  versions  of  these  products  suitable  for 

Minors. When the “underage mode” is activated by the guardian or the minor in Tencent Video and Weishi, viewers 

will have their screen time set on a limit and reminded to take breaks. In addition, we updated Weixin in 2021 

with a variety of functions to protect Minors, including (i) parental control over their children’s access to videos, 

subscriptions and Mini Programmes; (ii) curated content for teenagers in Weixin Video Accounts; (iii) closed live 

broadcast portal to Minors, where they are not allowed to initiate a live broadcast or use the tipping function within; 

and  (iv)  disabled  access  to  Q  coins  top-up,  credit  card  repayment  and  other  services  that  are  not  suitable  for 

Minors.

Responsible Content and Internet Community

According  to  the  relevant  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  agreements  such as Wexin Software License and 

Service Agreement, Wexin Official Accounts Platform Service Agreement and QQ Software License and Service 

Agreement, if users spread unlawful information through Wexin personal account, Wexin Official Accounts, QQ and 

Qzone, once found and proven, the platform will remove the unlawful content and take actions upon the relevant 

accounts (such as warning, blocking and limiting some functions of the account). We continue to optimise the audit 

standards and inspection mechanism of Mini Programmes and Mini Games access. We conduct reviews and tests 

in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements on the developers and their submitted application contents 

for gaining access to the Mini Programmes and Mini Games platform. Developers who offer services that involve 

special industries, such as medical, finance and games, shall provide corresponding qualifications and approval 

documents. If the developers fail to provide the relevant certificates, their request to publish their Mini Programmes 

and Mini Games onto the platform will be consequently denied. We manage the platform in accordance with the 

above-mentioned relevant agreements and platform rules, and take timely actions upon receiving users’ complaints 

and reports, as well as taking corresponding measures for developers who fail to operate legally. We attach great 

importance  to  educating  our  users  on  various  risk  prevention  topics,  such  as  internet  pornography  and  fraud 

through the “Weixin Safety Centre”, “QQ Security Centre” official accounts and other official channels. Weixin and 

QQ each provides a mechanism for users to report any false or improper content published on their platforms. We 

continue to improve the efficiency of handling users’ complaints regarding infringement and promote access to the 

reporting channels. We also provide guidance to users on filing complaints and reports on any violations of laws 

and regulations, or violations of their legitimate rights and interests through prescribed channels on our platforms. 

In 2021, Tencent released 3,189 articles on dispelling misinformation, which has been viewed more than 310 

million times.

In order to help the silver generation and other vulnerable groups gain better access to the mobile internet, for 

instance, Wexin and a number of products launched the “Easy Mode” in 2021, which offers big text fonts, large 

icons and high contrast colours to enhance their product experience.

According to the Advertising Law of the People’s Republic of China and the Interim Measures for Administration of 

Internet Advertising, advertising operators and advertising publishers shall verify all relevant business documents 

pursuant  to  laws  and  administrative  regulations  and  verify  the  advertising  contents.  We  review  the  advertising 

contents  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  above  laws  and  regulations  and  require  clients  who  intend  to  use  the 

Tencent Marketing Solution platform to publish advertisements to ensure the legality of the advertising content. 

They must also show that they have valid qualifications to publish relevant advertisements and that the advertising 

contents are proven to be genuine. After the review is approved, we conduct checks on the advertising content to 

ensure its compliance through our automatic inspection system which is equipped with multiple capabilities along 

with our professional inspectors. Once violations of laws and regulations or relevant rules of Tencent Marketing 

Solution are found, we will take measures, such as refusing the release of illegal advertising materials, removing 

illegal advertisements from the platforms, requiring the violator to bear liability for breach of contract. Meanwhile, 

we strive to better protect the rights and interests of users and comply with the requirements of current laws and 

regulations; for that, we continue to establish and improve the compliance assessment regarding the advertising 

business,  promote  training  and  advocacy  for  employees  and  partners,  enhance  system  capabilities  so  as  to

Impairment assessments of goodwill, investments in associates 

and joint ventures (continued)

In  respect  of  the  impairment  assessments  of  cash 

generating  units  that  contain  goodwill,  investments 

in  associates  and  investments  in  joint  ventures  using 

discounted cash  flows, we assessed the key assumptions 

adopted  including  revenue  growth  rates,  profit  margins, 

discount  rates  and  other  assumptions  by  examining 

the  approved  financial/business  forecast  models,  and 

comparing actual results for the year against the previous 

period’s forecasts and the applicable industry/business data 

external  to  the  Group.  We  assessed  certain  of  these  key 

assumptions with the involvement of our internal valuation 

experts. We considered that the key assumptions adopted 

by  management  were  in  line  with  our  expectation  and 

evidence obtained.

In  respect  of  the  impairment  assessments  of  cash 

generating  units  that  contain  goodwill,  investments  in 

associates and investments in joint ventures using market 

approach, we assessed the valuation assumptions including 

the  selection  of  comparable  companies,  recent  market 

transactions, and liquidity discount for lack of marketability, 

etc.  We  assessed  these  key  assumptions  adopted  by 

management with the involvement of our internal valuation 

experts based on our industry knowledge and independent 

research  performed  by  us.  We  considered  that  the  key 

assumptions adopted by management were in line with our 

expectation and evidence obtained.

We independently tested, on a sample basis, the accuracy 

of mathematical calculation applied in the valuation models 

and  the  calculation  of  impairment  charges.  We  did  not 

identify any material exceptions from our testing.

OTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

166

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s Report

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

‧ 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

‧  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

‧ 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

‧ 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

‧ 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

‧  Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

167

Annual Report 2021Independent Auditor’s Report

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Tong Yu Keung.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  Value-added  Services  (“VAS”),  Online  Advertising  services  and  FinTech  and 

Business Services.

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable the Company to own and control 

the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited 

(“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 February 2000.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

‧ 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

‧ 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer; and

‧ 

the right to control the management, financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2021

GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 48) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 48.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or 

loss (“FVPL”), financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”), dividends payable for 

distribution in specie, certain other financial assets and liabilities, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 

are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

(a)  Amendments to standards adopted by the Group

The following amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year beginning on 1 January 2021:

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, 

Interest rate benchmark reform – phase 2 (“phase 2”)

IFRS 4 and IFRS 16

2 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.1  Basis of preparation (continued)

(a)  Amendments to standards adopted by the Group (continued)

The amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its benchmark interest 

rate exposures. The Group has floating rate debts, linked to USD LIBOR, including borrowings and senior 

notes, whose cash flows are hedged by using interest rate swaps. The LIBOR benchmark in which the Group 

continues to have hedging instrument is USD LIBOR. It is expected that the transition out of USD LIBOR 

hedging derivatives will be completed before 30 June 2023, and no significant impact arose as a result of 

applying those amendments during the year ended 31 December 2021.

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards issued but not yet effective

The following new standards and amendments to standards have not come into effect for the financial year 

beginning on 1 January 2021 and have not been early adopted by the Group in preparing the consolidated 

financial  statements.  None  of  these  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  consolidated  financial 

statements of the Group.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.1  Basis of preparation (continued)

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards issued but not yet effective (continued)

The Group considers the lease as a single transaction in which the assets and liabilities are integrally linked. 

There  is  no  net  temporary  difference  at  inception.  Subsequently,  when  differences  on  settlement  of  the 

liabilities and the amortisation of right-of-use assets arise, there will be a net temporary difference on which 

deferred income tax is recognised. Upon the effective date of amendments to IAS 12 on 1 January 2023, the 

Group will need to recognise a deferred income tax asset and a deferred income tax liability for the temporary 

differences arising on a lease on initial recognition.

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  where  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 

consideration  arrangement,  which  is  recognised  under “Other  financial  assets”  or  “Other  financial 

liabilities”  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and 

contingent consideration assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 

at the acquisition date.

183

Annual Report 2021Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2021

2 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.2  Subsidiaries (continued)

(a)  Consolidation (continued)

(i) 

Business combinations (continued)

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as 

equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the total of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 

acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the 

fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration 

transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the 

fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference 

is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.2  Subsidiaries (continued)

(a)  Consolidation (continued)

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or a financial asset. 

In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 48(f)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally 

but  not  necessarily  accompanying  a  shareholding  of  between  20%  and  50%  of  the  voting  rights.  Investments 

in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 

Group’s investments in associates include underlying goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated 

impairment loss.

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates  are recognised as  a reduction  in the 

carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  Where  the  Group’s  share  of  losses  in  an  associate  equals  or  exceeds  its 

interests  in  the  associate,  including  any  other  unsecured  long-term  receivables,  the  Group  does  not  recognise 

further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including investments in associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.4), are impaired. 

If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference  between  the  recoverable 

amount of the investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the 

consolidated income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.4  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.

Joint operations

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its 

share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the 

financial statements under the appropriate headings.

Joint ventures

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. Where the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in 

the joint venture (which includes any other unsecured long-term receivables that, in substance, form part of the 

Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interests  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.5 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The  cost  of  associates/joint  ventures  acquired  in  stages,  except  for  the  change  from  an  associate  to  a  joint 

venture,  is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interests  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any 

additional consideration transferred as of the date when they become associates/joint ventures. A gain or loss on 

remeasurement of the previously held interests is taken to the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.6  Disposal of associates and joint ventures

When  the  Group  ceases  to  continue  equity  accounting  for  an  associate  or  joint  venture  because  of  a  loss  of 

significant influence or joint control, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A gain or loss is recognised 

at  any  difference  between  the  fair  value  of  any  retained  interest  plus  any  proceeds  from  disposing  part  of  the 

interests in the associate or joint venture and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method 

of accounting was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of 

an associate or joint venture should be reclassified to the consolidated income statement or transferred to another 

category  of  equity  as  specified  and  permitted  by  applicable  IFRSs  when  the  Group  ceases  to  continue  equity 

accounting for the associate or joint venture.

2.7  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.8  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.8  Foreign currency translation (continued)

(b)  Transactions and balances (continued)

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange 

rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on non-monetary assets and 

liabilities  carried  at  fair  value  are  reported  as  part  of  the  fair  value  gain  or  loss.  For  example,  translation 

differences  on  non-monetary  financial  assets  and  liabilities  such  as  equity  instruments  held  at  fair  value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or 

loss and translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equity instruments classified as 

FVOCI, are included in other comprehensive income.

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at  average  exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 

taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.9  Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the items will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the items can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the reporting period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings

20 ~ 50 years

Computer and other operating equipment

2 ~ 10 years

Furniture and office equipment

Motor vehicles

2 ~ 5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease term

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction costs less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.14).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.10 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts (Note 2.14).

2.11 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease.

2.12 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised as described in Note 2.2(a) and included in “Intangible 

assets” in the consolidated financial statements.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying amount of the CGU or group of CGUs including 

the allocated goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 

value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately under “Other gains/(losses), net” and 

is not subsequently reversed.

2.12 Intangible assets (continued)

(b)  Media contents

Media contents mainly include game licenses, video and music contents, and literature copyrights. They are 

initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value as acquired through business combinations. 

Media  contents  are  amortised  using  a  straight-line  method  or  an  accelerated  method  which  reflects  the 

estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include trademarks, other copyrights, computer software and technology, non-

compete agreements, customer relationships and land with indefinite useful life. They are initially recognised 

and measured at cost or estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Land with indefinite useful life is not subject to amortisation and impairment reviews are undertaken annually 

or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Other intangible 

assets  are  amortised  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  (generally  one  to  ten  years)  using  the  straight-line 

method which reflects the pattern in which the intangible assets’ future economic benefits are expected to 

be consumed.

2.13 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 48(f)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.14 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might 

be impaired. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 

carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 

less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 

levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than 

goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.15 Investments and other financial assets

(a)  Classification and measurement

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

‧ 

those  to  be  measured  subsequently  at  fair  value  (either  through  other  comprehensive  income,  or 

through profit or loss); and

‧ 

those to be measured at amortised cost.

The  classification  depends  on  the  Group’s  business  model  for  managing  the  financial  assets  and  the 

contractual terms of the cash flows.

Except for accounts receivable, at initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value 

plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly 

attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value 

through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.15 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 

cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

Debt instruments

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group’s business model 

for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three categories 

into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

‧ 

Amortised cost: Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash 

flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are classified as and measured at amortised 

cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment measured at amortised cost which is not part of a hedging 

relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income 

from these financial assets is recognised using the effective interest method.

‧ 

FVOCI:  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  and  for  selling  the 

financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are 

classified  as  and  measured  at  FVOCI.  Movements  in  the  carrying  amount  of  these  financial  assets 

are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the  recognition of impairment losses  or 

reversals,  interest  income  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or 

loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in “Other gains/

(losses),  net”  in  the  consolidated  income  statement.  Interest  income  from  these  financial  assets  is 

recognised using the effective interest method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in 

“Finance costs, net” and impairment losses or reversals are presented in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

‧ 

FVPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are classified as and 

measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  debt  investment  measured  at  fair 

value through profit or loss which is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and 

presented in “Other gains/(losses), net” for the period in which it arises.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets 

changes.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.15 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Equity instruments

The Group initially recognises and subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Upon initial 

recognition,  the  Group’s  management  can  elect  to  classify  irrevocably  its  equity  investments  as  financial 

assets at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity instrument under IAS 32 and are not held for trading. 

The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Where  the  Group  has  made  the  irrevocable  election  to  present  fair  value  gains  and  losses  on  equity 

investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and 

losses  to  profit  or  loss  following  the  derecognition  of  the  investments.  Dividends  from  such  investments 

continue to be recognised in profit or loss as  “Other gains/(losses), net” when the Group’s right to receive 

payments is established. Equity instruments designated as FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

FVPL  include  financial  assets  designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and 

financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI. Changes in the fair value of FVPL 

are recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

(b) 

Impairment

The  Group  assesses  on  a  forward-looking  basis  the  expected  credit  losses  associated  with  its  debt 

instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether 

there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, 

which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised since initial recognition.

Impairment on deposits and other receivables is  measured  as either 12-month  expected credit losses  or 

lifetime expected credit losses, depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 

since initial recognition. If a significant increase in credit risk of a deposit or receivable has occurred since 

initial recognition, the impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.

2.16 Derivative and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive 

and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative, which are recognised under  “Other  financial assets” 

and “Other financial liabilities” in the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The method of recognising 

the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 

nature of the item being hedged.

The  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  as  hedges  of  a  particular  risk  associated  with  the  cash  flows  of  a 

recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges). The Group documents 

at the inception of the hedging relationship the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 

items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The 

Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the 

inception of each hedge relationship.

A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the hedge effectiveness requirements under 

IFRS 9. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 

flow  hedges  is  recognised  through  other  comprehensive  income  within  equity,  while  any  ineffective  portion  is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss, within “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in the 

cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item 

(“aligned time value”) are recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within 

equity.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 Derivative and hedging activities (continued)

Amounts accumulated in equity are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, 

as follows:

‧  Where  the  hedged  item  subsequently  results  in  the  recognition  of  a  non-financial  asset,  the  amounts 

accumulated  in  equity  are  removed  from  other  reserves  and  included  within  the  initial  cost  of  the  asset. 

These deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss.

‧ 

For  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  effective  portion  of  the  derivatives  is 

reclassified to profit or loss at the same time when the hedged cash flows affects profit or loss.

When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for 

hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remain 

in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 

cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging included in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or 

loss.

Hedge relationships

The “phase 2” amendments address issues arising during interest rate benchmark reform, including specifying 

when the Interest rate benchmark reform – phase 1 (“phase 1”) amendments will cease to apply, when hedge 

designations and documentation should be updated, and when hedges of the alternative benchmark rate as the 

hedged risk are permitted.

The  “phase  1”  amendments  provided  temporary  relief  from  applying  specific  hedge  accounting  requirements 

to hedging relationships directly affected by Inter Bank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) reform. The reliefs had the effect 

that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate prior to contracts being amended. 

However,  any  hedge  ineffectiveness  continued  to  be  recorded  in  the  income  statement.  Furthermore,  the 

amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs would end, which included the uncertainty arising from interest 

rate benchmark reform no longer being present.

The  LIBOR  benchmark  in  which  the  Group  continues  to  have  hedging  instrument  is  USD  LIBOR,  for  which 

it  is  expected  that  the  transition  out  will  be  completed  before  30  June  2023.  The  Group  will  update  its  hedge 

documentation  to  reflect  the  changes  in  designation  (including  designating  an  alternative  benchmark  rate 

as  a  hedged  risk,  amending  the  description  of  the  hedged  item,  and  amending  the  description  of  hedging 

instrument) by the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. These amendments to the hedge 

documentation do not require the Group to discontinue its hedge relationships.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.17 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and  there  is  an intention  to 

settle on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 

must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in certain 

circumstances, such as default, insolvency, bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

2.18 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily  accounted for  using  the  weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.19 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable are presented as current assets unless collection is not expected 

within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain 

significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment that is subject to expected credit loss model 

(Note 3.1(b)).

2.20 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents mainly include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term 

highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

The Group does not recognise cash amounts deposited with banks in the Mainland of China (which are received 

under its payment business) under users’ entrustment in the consolidated statement of financial position as the 

Group holds these cash amounts as a custodian according to the relevant users’ agreements.

2.21 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  Group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  instruments,  the  consideration  paid,  including 

any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 

as  treasury  shares  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued, 

any  consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.22 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 

months after the end of the reporting period.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair  value and subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the 

effective interest method.

2.23 Put option arrangements on non-controlling interest

Put options on non-controlling interest of the Group are financial instruments granted by the Group which permit 

the holders to put back to the Group their shares in certain non wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group for cash or 

other financial instruments when certain conditions are met. If the Group does not have the unconditional right to 

avoid delivering cash or other financial instruments under the put option, a financial liability is initially recognised 

under “Other financial liabilities” in the consolidated financial statements at the present value of the estimated 

future cash outflows on exercise under the put option. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates of payments, 

the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised  estimated  cash 

outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount based on the present value of revised estimated future 

cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the adjustment will be recognised in 

the consolidated statement of changes in equity. In the event that the put option expires unexercised, the liability is 

derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option first becomes exercisable 12 months after the 

end of the reporting period.

2.24 Borrowings, notes payable and borrowing costs

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their terms using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan facilities to the 

extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 

draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 

down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the term of the facility to 

which it relates.

Borrowings and notes payable are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to 

defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction  of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 

added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 

sale. During the year ended 31 December 2021, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.25 Current and deferred income tax

The  income  tax  expense  for  the  year  comprises  current  and  deferred  income  tax,  which  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 

income or directly in equity. In this case, the income tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in 

equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority 

will accept an uncertain tax treatment. When it is not probable, the Group measures its tax balances either based 

on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the 

resolution of the uncertainty.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.25 Current and deferred income tax (continued)

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  However, 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 

a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable 

profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 

or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred 

income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available to utilise those temporary differences and tax losses.

Deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  provided  on  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in  subsidiaries, 

associates  and  joint  ventures,  except  for  deferred  income  tax  liability  where  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the 

temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 

in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for 

associates and joint ventures. Only when there is an agreement in place that gives the Group the ability to control 

the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, deferred income tax liability in relation to taxable 

temporary differences arising from the associates’ and joint ventures’ undistributed profit is not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.26 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they are accrued to employees. A provision is 

made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end 

of the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time 

of leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate fund. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior years. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c) 

Long-term employee benefit obligations

In  addition  to  participating  in  the  defined  contribution  plan  as  described  above,  the  Group  also  provides 

commercial health insurance benefits to certain eligible employees till their resignation or retirement. These 

obligations are classified as non-current liabilities unless it is expected to be settled wholly within 12 months 

after the end of the reporting period.

These  long-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are  measured  as  the  present  value  of  expected  future 

payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period 

using the projected unit credit method. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the 

end of the reporting period of high-quality corporate bonds with terms and currencies that match, as closely 

as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. For currencies for which there is no deep market in such 

high-quality corporate bonds, the market yields on government bonds denominated in that currency were 

applied. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are 

recognised in profit or loss.

2.26 Employee benefits (continued)

(d) 

Long-term service awards

The Group recognises a liability and an expense for long-term service awards where cash is paid to retired 

employees qualified for certain criteria as one-off retirement bonus and it was considered as defined benefit 

plan. The method of accounting is similar to those used for long-term employee benefits as described above, 

except that remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 

assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

(e)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants  as  consideration  for  equity  instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of 

the Group. The fair value of the employee services and other qualifying participants’ services received in 

exchange  for  the  grant  of  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  is  recognised  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting 

period, i.e. the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied and credited to 

equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 

the  options  granted  by  using  option-pricing  model, “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the “Binomial 

Model”), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) 

but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award 

shares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s 

shares at the grant date. The Group also adopts valuation and actuarial techniques to assess the fair value of 

other equity instruments of the Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From the perspective of the Company, the grants of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries are 

made in exchange for their services related to the subsidiaries. Accordingly, the share-based compensation 

expenses are treated as part of the “Investments in subsidiaries” or “Other receivables” in the Company’s 

statement of financial position.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.26 Employee benefits (continued)

(e)  Share-based compensation benefits (continued)

At each reporting period end, the Group revises the estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 

consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When  the  options  are  exercised,  the  proceeds  received  net  of  any  directly  attributable  transaction  costs 

are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium. When the vested equity instruments are 

later forfeited prior to expiry date, the amount previously recognised in share premium will be transferred to 

retained earnings.

If  the  Group  repurchases  vested  equity  instruments,  the  payments  made  to  the  employees  and  other 

qualifying  participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the 

payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. 

Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense  is recognised  for  any  modification that increases  the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

Cash-settled share-based payment transactions are those arrangements which the terms provide the Group 

to settle the transaction in cash. Upon the satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the Group shall account for 

that transaction as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction if, and to the extent that, the Group has 

incurred a liability to settle in cash.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised 

at the current fair value determined at the end of the reporting period.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.27 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.28 Revenue recognition

The Group generates revenues primarily from provision of VAS, Online Advertising services, FinTech and Business 

Services,  and  other  online  related  services  in  the  PRC.  Revenue  is  recognised  when  the  control  of  the  goods 

or services is transferred to a customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the 

contract, control of the goods and services may be transferred over time or at a point in time.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  primarily  include  revenues  from  the  provision  of  online  games  and  social  networks 

services. Online games revenues are mainly derived from sales of in-game virtual items, and social networks 

revenues  are  mainly  derived  from  sales  of  virtual  items  such  as  VAS  subscriptions  across  various  online 

platforms, and games revenues attributable to social networks business. The Group offers virtual items to 

users on the Group’s online platforms. The VAS fees are paid directly by end users mainly via online payment 

channels.

Revenue from VAS is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services. 

Given that there is an explicit or implicit obligation of the Group to maintain the virtual items operated on the 

Group’s platforms and allow users to gain access to them, revenue is recognised over the estimated lifespans 

of  the  respective  virtual  items.  The  estimated  lifespans  of  different  virtual  items  are  determined  by  the 

management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the 

relevant virtual items depending on the respective term of virtual items.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.28 Revenue recognition (continued)

(a)  VAS (continued)

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to 

each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the 

prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

In respect of the Group’s VAS directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various third-

party platforms, these third-party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Online Service Fees”) on 

behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of platform provider fees (as part 

of “Channel and distribution costs”). Such Channel and distribution costs are withheld and deducted from 

the gross Online Service Fees collected by these platforms from the users, with the net amounts remitted 

to the Group. The Group recognises the Online Service Fees as revenue on a gross or net basis depending 

on whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in these transactions based on the assessment 

according to the criteria stated in (e) below.

The  Group  also  opens  its  online  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  under  certain  co-

operation  agreements,  of  which  the  Group  pays  to  the  third-party  game/application  developers  a  pre-

determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from the users of the Group’s online platforms for 

the virtual items purchased. The Group recognises the related revenue on a gross or net basis depending on 

whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction.

The Group adopts different revenue recognition methods based on its specific responsibilities/obligations in 

different VAS offerings.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.28 Revenue recognition (continued)

(b)  Online Advertising

Online Advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from media advertisements and from social 

and other advertisements, depending on the placement of advertising properties and inventories.

Advertising contracts are signed to establish the prices and advertising services to be provided based on 

different arrangements, including display-based advertising that are display of ads for an agreed period of 

time, and performance-based advertising that are based on actual performance measurement.

Revenue from display-based advertising is recognised on number of display/impression basis or depending 

on  the  contractual  measures.  Revenue  from  performance-based  advertising  is  recognised  when  relevant 

specific performance measures are fulfilled. Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, 

the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling 

price basis, which is determined based on the prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

(c)  FinTech and Business Services

FinTech and Business Services revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from provision of FinTech and 

cloud services.

FinTech  service  revenues  mainly  include  commissions  from  payment,  wealth  management  and  other 

FinTech services, which are generally determined as a percentage based on the value of transaction amount 

or retention amount. Revenue related to such commissions is recognised upon  a point in  time when  the 

Group satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services.

Cloud services are mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. For cloud service contracts 

billed based on a fixed amount for a specified service period, revenue is recognised over the subscribed 

period when the services are delivered to customers. For cloud service provided on a consumption basis, 

revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  customer  utilisation  of  the  resources.  When  a  cloud-based  service 

includes multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance 

obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the prices charged to 

or expected to recover from customers.

(d)  Other revenues

The Group’s other revenues are primarily derived from production of and distribution of, films and television 

programmes for third parties, copyrights licensing, merchandise sales and various other activities. The Group 

recognises other revenues when the respective services are rendered, or when the control of the products is 

transferred to customers.

(e)  Principal agent consideration

The  Group  reports  the  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  depending  on  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  a 

principal or an agent in a transaction. The Group is a principal if it controls the specified product or service 

before that product or service is transferred to a customer or it has a right to direct others to provide the 

product or service to the customer on the Group’s behalf. Indicators that the Group is a principal include 

but are not limited to whether the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in 

establishing the selling price; (iii) has discretion in supplier selection; (iv) changes the product or performs 

part of the service, and (v) has involvement in the determination of product or service specifications.

(f) 

Contract liabilities and contract costs

A contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group 

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. The Group’s contract 

liabilities  mainly  comprise  virtual  items,  unamortised  pre-paid  tokens  or  cards,  Internet  traffic  and  other 

support to be offered to certain investee companies in the future periods measured at their fair value on the 

inception dates, and customer loyalty incentives offered to the customers (Note 5(c)).

Contract  costs  include  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  costs  to  fulfil  a  contract  with  the 

customers.  The  contract  costs  are  amortised  using  a  method  which  is  consistent  with  the  pattern  of 

recognition  of  the  respective  revenues.  The  Group  has  applied  the  practical  expedient  to  recognise  the 

contract  cost  relating  to  obtaining  a  contract  as  an  expense  when  incurred,  if  otherwise  the  amortisation 

period is one year or less.

2.29 Interest income

Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial 

asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 

the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss 

allowance). Interest income is presented as “Interest income” where it is mainly earned from financial assets that 

are held for cash management purposes.

2.30 Dividend income

Dividends  are  received  from  FVPL  and  FVOCI.  Dividends  are  recognised  in  “Other  gains/(losses),  net”  in  the 

consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established. This applies even if they are paid 

out of pre-acquisition profits, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment. 

In this case, the dividend is recognised in other comprehensive income if it relates to an investment measured at 

FVOCI.

2.31 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair values where there is a reasonable assurance that 

the grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

and expenses which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.32 Leases

The  Group  leases  land  (Note  2.11),  various  buildings,  computer  and  other  operating  equipment  and  others. 

Rental contracts other than land are typically made for fixed periods of no longer than 10 years. Lease terms are 

negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements 

do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. A lease is 

recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for 

use by the Group. A right-of-use asset arising from land lease is presented as “Land use rights”.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.32 Leases (continued)

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include 

the net present value of the following lease payments:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;

amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease.  If  that  rate  cannot  be  readily 

determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, 

being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of 

similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

‧  where  possible,  uses  recent  third-party  financing  received  by  the  individual  lessee  as  a  starting  point, 

adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;

‧ 

uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the Group, 

which does not have recent third-party financing; and

‧  makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.32 Leases (continued)

If a readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent financing or market 

data) which has a similar payment profile to the lease, then the Group entities use that rate as a starting point to 

determine the incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 

the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 

each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

‧ 

‧ 

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

‧ 

any initial direct costs; and

‧ 

restoration costs.

A  right-of-use  asset  is  generally  depreciated  over  the  shorter  of  the  asset’s  useful  life  and  the  lease  term  on  a 

straight-line  basis.  If  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  a  purchase  option,  the  right-of-use  asset  is 

depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. 

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less without a purchase option.

2.33 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate and no longer at the discretion of the Group.

In respect of a dividend by way of distribution of non-cash assets, the liability to distribute the non-cash assets 

as a dividend is measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed on the declaration date. At the end of 

the  reporting  period  and  at  the  date  of  settlement,  the  Group  reviews  and  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of  the 

dividend liability, and any subsequent change in the fair value of the dividend liability is recognised in equity as an 

adjustment to the amount of the dividend distribution. Upon settlement, the difference between the fair value of 

the assets distributed, which is also the carrying amount of the dividend liability, and the carrying amount of the 

assets distributed, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.

The non-cash assets to be distributed are presented as “Assets held for distribution” in the consolidated statement 

of financial position.

2.34 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products) 

are  capitalised  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed  annually.  Other 

development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. Development 

costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the management of the Group.

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency exposures, primarily with respect to Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”), USD and Euro (“EUR”). 

Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  when  future  commercial  transactions  or  recognised  assets  and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

subsidiaries. The functional currency of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures.

As  at  31  December  2021,  the  Group’s  major  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  exposed  to  foreign 

exchange risk are listed below:

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (continued)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  the  Group  reported  exchange  gains  of  approximately 

RMB804  million  (2020:  exchange  losses  of  approximately  RMB438  million)  within  “Finance  costs, 

net” in the consolidated income statement.

As at 31 December 2021, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange 

rates  of  the  above  currencies  against  the  two  major  functional  currencies  would  not  result  in  a 

significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities 

denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currencies are considered 

to be not significant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.

(ii)  Price risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  mainly  arising  from  investments  held  by  the  Group  that 

are  classified  either  as  FVPL  (Note  24)  or  FVOCI  (Note  25).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from 

the investments, the Group diversifies its investment portfolio. The investments are  made either for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity  analysis  is  performed  by  management  to  assess  the  exposure  of  the  Group’s  financial 

results  to  equity  price  risk  of  FVPL  and  FVOCI  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  If  prices  of  the 

respective  instruments  held  by  the  Group  had  been  5%  (31  December  2020:  5%)  higher/lower  as 

at 31 December 2021, profit for the year would have been approximately RMB9,815 million (2020: 

RMB8,326  million)  higher/lower  as  a  result  of  gains/losses  on  financial  instruments  classified  as  at 

FVPL,  other  comprehensive  income  would  have  been  approximately  RMB12,348  million  (2020: 

RMB10,529 million) higher/lower as a result of gains/losses on financial instruments classified as at 

FVOCI.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The  Group’s  income  and  operating  cash  flows  are  substantially  independent  of  changes  in  market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 26, 29 and 31.

If the interest rate of term deposits with initial terms of over three months had been 50 basis points 

higher/lower, the profit before income tax for the year ended  31  December 2021 would  have  been 

RMB517 million (2020: RMB501 million) higher/lower. If the interest rate of cash and cash equivalents 

had been 50 basis points higher/lower, the profit before income tax for the year ended 31 December 

2021 would have been RMB840 million (2020: RMB764 million) higher/lower.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 36 and 37, representing a substantial portion 

of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group to cash 

flow interest-rate risk whereas those carried at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate 

risk.

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

The  Group  entered  into  certain  interest  rate  swap  contracts  to  hedge  its  exposure  arising  from 

borrowings and senior notes  carried at floating rates. Under these interest  rate  swap contracts,  the 

Group  agreed  with  the  counterparties  to  exchange,  at  specified  interval,  the  difference  between 

fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional 

amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings and 

senior notes from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified for hedge accounting. Details of the 

Group’s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2021 are mainly disclosed in both 

Note 27 and 39.

interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to 

cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after 

considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, accounts receivable, other receivables, as well as short-term investments measured at amortised 

cost,  at  FVOCI  and  at  FVPL.  The  carrying  amount  of  each  class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the 

Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

The majority of the balances of accounts receivable are due from online advertising customers and agencies, 

content production related customers, FinTech and cloud customers and third party platform providers. To 

manage the risk arising from accounts receivable, the Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues 

of credit terms are made to counterparties with an appropriate credit history and the management performs 

ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties. The credit periods granted to these customers are disclosed 

in Note 30 and the credit quality of these customers is assessed, which takes into account their financial 

position, past experience and other factors. The Group has a large number of customers and there is no 

significant concentration of credit risk.

Other receivables are mainly comprised of receivables related to financial services, interest receivables, loans 

to investees and investees’ shareholders, lease deposits and other receivables. Management manages the 

loans  by  category,  makes  periodic  assessments  as  well  as  individual  assessment  on  the  recoverability  of 

other receivables based on historical settlement records and past experience.

For financial assets whose impairment losses are measured using expected credit loss model, the Group 

assesses  whether  their  credit  risk  has  increased  significantly  since  their  initial  recognition,  and  applies  a 

three-stage impairment model to calculate their impairment allowance and recognise their expected credit 

losses, as follows:

–  

Stage 1: If the credit risk has not increased significantly since its initial recognition, the financial asset 

is included in stage 1.

–  

Stage 2: If the credit risk has increased significantly since its initial recognition but not yet deemed to 

be credit-impaired, the financial instrument is included in stage 2.

–  

Stage 3: If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is included in stage 3.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

The Group considers the credit risk characteristics of different financial  instruments when  determining  if 

there is significant increase in credit risk. For financial instruments with or without significant increase in 

credit risk, lifetime or 12-month expected credit losses are provided respectively.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a 

significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each of the years. To assess whether there 

is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares risk of a default occurring on the assets as at 

year end with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. In particular, the following indicators are 

incorporated:

‧ 

internal credit rating;

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

external credit rating (as far as available);

actual  or  expected  significant  adverse  changes  in  business,  financial  economic  conditions  that  are 

expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;

actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty; and

significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the counterparty, including changes 

in the payment status of the counterparty.

(i) 

Credit risk of cash and deposits

To  manage  this  risk,  the  Group  only  makes  transactions  with  state-owned  banks  and  financial 

institutions in the PRC and reputable international banks and financial institutions outside of the PRC. 

There has been no recent history of default in relation to these banks and financial institutions. The 

expected credit loss is close to zero.

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 

9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all accounts receivable. In view of 

the sound financial position and collection history of receivables due from these counterparties and 

insignificant  risk  of  default,  to  measure  the  expected  credit  losses,  accounts  receivable  have  been 

grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable (continued)

The  expected  loss  rates  are  based  on  the  payment  profiles  of  revenue  over  12  months  before  31 

December  2021  and  the  corresponding  historical  credit  losses  experienced  within  this  period  or 

probability  of  a  receivable  progressing  through  successive  stages  of  delinquency  to  write-off.  The 

historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic 

factors  affecting  the  ability  of  the  customers  to  settle  the  receivables.  The  Group  has  identified  the 

Gross  Domestic  Product  (“GDP”)  to  be  the  most  relevant  factor.  Various  economic  scenarios  are 

considered  in  generating  the  forward-looking  adjustment,  including  the  recent  influences  of  the 

coronavirus pandemic situation.

A default on accounts receivable occurs when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments 

within 90 days when they fall due. To measure the expected credit losses, accounts receivable are 

grouped  on  the  basis  of  shared  credit  risk  characteristics,  such  as  industry,  with  the  objective  of 

facilitating an analysis to identify significant increases in credit risk and recognition of loss allowance 

on a timely basis. Accounts receivable are written off, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all 

practical  recovery  efforts  and  has  concluded  that  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  of  recovery. 

Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a 

debtor to engage in a repayment plan within the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for 

a period of greater than 3 years past due.

Impairment losses on accounts receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating 

profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same item.

(iii)  Credit risk of other receivables

Management considers the credit risk of other receivables is insignificant when they have a low risk of 

default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near 

term, and the loss allowance recognised is therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. In view 

of insignificant risk of default and credit risk since initial recognition, management believes that the 

expected credit loss under the 12 months expected losses method is immaterial.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital  refers  to  equity  and  external  debts  (including  borrowings  and  notes  payable).  In  order  to  maintain  or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The Group assesses its creditworthiness based on its business and financial risk profile and monitors its capital by 

regularly reviewing its debts to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) 

(Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all of its debts which in turn reflects the Group’s 

financial health and liquidity position. The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts 

by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Borrowings (Note 36)

Notes payable (Note 37)

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

‧  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

‧ 

‧ 

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

Note:

It represented the dividend liability resulting from distribution in specie which was measured at fair value of JD.com Inc. (“JD.

com”) shares to be distributed (Note 15(b)).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined  with  reference  to  quoted  market 

prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly 

available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices 

represent  actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.  These  instruments  are 

included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include:

‧  Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

‧ 

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

‧  Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

Note:

During the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020, transfers from level 3 to level 1 were mainly due to the successful Initial 

Public Offerings (“IPOs”) of existing investees.

Valuation processes inputs and relationships to fair value (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who performs valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. The 

team performs valuation, or necessary updates, at least once every quarter, which coincides with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  team  adopts  various  valuation  techniques  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  Group’s  level  3 

instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and consulted when it is necessary.

The  components  of  the  level  3  instruments  mainly  include  investments  in  unlisted  companies  classified  as  FVPL  or  FVOCI, 

other financial assets, and other financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities mainly include contingent consideration payable 

related to certain business combinations. As these investments and instruments are not traded in an active market, the majority 

of their fair values have been determined using applicable valuation techniques including comparable companies approach, 

comparable transactions approach and other option pricing approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgments, 

assumptions  and  inputs,  including  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility,  relevant  underlying  financial  projections,  and  market 

information of recent transactions (such as recent fund-raising transactions undertaken by the investees) and other exposure, 

etc.

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value 

measurements of investments in unlisted companies.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

Note: (continued)

For contingent consideration related to a business combination of a subsidiary, which is principally engaged in the television 

series and film production business, the significant unobservable inputs are growth rate of net profit and expected volatility, which 

are 10% (31 December 2020: 15%) and 30% (31 December 2020: 35%), respectively. The higher the growth rate, the higher 

the fair value; and the higher the expected volatility, the lower the fair value.

For the fair value of the Group’s investments in unlisted companies, the sensitivity analysis is performed by management, see 

Note 3.1(a)(ii) for details.

For the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combination, if growth rate of net profit had been 5% higher or 

lower as at 31 December 2021, the fair value would have increased by approximately RMB36 million (2020: RMB73 million) or 

decreased by approximately RMB45 million (2020: RMB97 million). If the expected volatility had been 5% higher or lower as at 

31 December 2021, the fair value would have decreased by approximately RMB37 million (2020: RMB66 million) or increased 

by approximately RMB41 million (2020: RMB66 million).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual items provided on the Group’s online platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.28(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  items  provided  on  the  Group’s  online 

platforms  and  the  relevant  revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  estimated  lifespans  of  the  virtual  items.  The 

estimated lifespans of different virtual items are determined by the management based on either the expected 

users’  relationship  periods  or  the  stipulated  period  of  validity  of  the  relevant  virtual  items  depending  on  the 

respective terms of virtual items.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual items provided on the Group’s online platforms (continued)

Significant  judgments  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  including  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespans 

of virtual items on a regular basis whenever there is any indication of change in the expected users’ relationship 

periods.

The  Group  will  continue  to  monitor  the  average  lifespans  of  the  virtual  items.  The  results  may  differ  from  the 

historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different basis 

from that in prior periods.

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, right-of-use assets as well as investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed 

for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully 

recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-use calculations or fair value less 

costs of disposal. These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgment is required to identify any impairment indicators existing for any of the Group’s goodwill and other non-

financial assets, to determine appropriate impairment approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value 

in use, for impairment review purposes, and to select key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, 

including  discounted  cash  flows  and  market  approach.  Changing  the  assumptions  selected  by  management 

in assessing impairment could materially affect the result of the impairment test and in turn affect the Group’s 

financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  If  there  is  a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  key  assumptions 

applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment charge to the consolidated income statement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(c)  Fair value measurement of FVPL, FVOCI and other financial liabilities

The fair value assessment of FVPL, FVOCI and other  financial liabilities that are  measured  at level  3 fair  value 

hierarchy  requires  significant  estimates,  which  include  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility,  relevant  underlying 

financial  projections,  market  information  of  recent  transactions  (such  as  recent  fund  raising  transactions 

undertaken  by  the  investees)  and  other  assumptions.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could 

materially affect the respective fair value of these investments.

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.26(e),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants.  The  directors  have  adopted  the  Binomial  Model  to  determine  the  total  fair  value  of  the  options 

granted, which is to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant estimates and judgment on key 

parameters, such as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, are required to be made by the directors 

based on historical experience and other relevant factors in applying the Binomial Model (Note 35). Changes in 

these estimates and judgments could materially affect the fair value of these options granted.

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Binomial Model was approximately HKD2,994 million (equivalent to approximately  RMB2,513 million) in  2021 

(2020: approximately HKD1,073 million (equivalent to approximately RMB976 million)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of vesting periods of the options and awarded shares (the  “Expected Retention Rate”) in order to determine the 

amount of share-based compensation expenses charged to the consolidated income statement. Where the final 

retention  rate  is  different  from  the  initial  estimate,  such  difference  will  impact  the  share-based  compensation 

expenses in subsequent periods. As at 31 December 2021, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group’s wholly-

owned subsidiaries was assessed to be not lower than 89% (31 December 2020: not lower than 91%).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(e) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the 

worldwide provision for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax in the period 

in which such determination is made.

(f)  Scope of consolidation

Consolidation is required only if control exists. The Group controls an investee when it has all the following: (i) 

power over the investee; (ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) 

the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group’s returns. Power results from rights 

that  can  be  straightforward  through  voting  rights  or  complicated  in  contractual  arrangements.  Variable  returns 

normally encompass financial benefits and risks, but in certain cases, they also include operational values specific 

to the Group. These three factors cannot be considered in isolation by the Group in its assessment of control over 

an investee. Where the factors of control are not apparent, significant judgement is applied in the assessment, 

which is based on an overall analysis of all of the relevant facts and circumstances.

The Group is required to reassess whether it controls the investee if facts and circumstances indicate a change to 

one or more of the three factors of control.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUES

(a)  Description of segments and principal activities

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s 

internal reporting in order to assess performance, allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based 

on these reports.

The Group has the following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020:

– 

VAS;

– 

Online Advertising;

– 

FinTech and Business Services; and

– 

Others.

The “Others” business segment consists of the financials of investment in, production of and distribution of, films 

and television programmes for third parties, copyrights licensing, merchandise sales and various other activities.

The chief operating decision-makers assess the performance of the operating segments mainly based on segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore, they 

are  not  included  in  the  measure  of  the  segments’  performance  which  is  used  by  the  chief  operating  decision-

makers as a basis for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Interest income, 

other gains/(losses), net, finance costs, net, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures, net and income 

tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020. The revenues 

from external customers reported to the chief operating decision-makers are measured in a manner consistent with 

that applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other  information,  together  with  the  segment  information,  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers,  is 

measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that  applied  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  were  no 

segment assets and segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

(iii)  PRC CIT

PRC  CIT  has  been  provided  for  at  applicable  tax  rates  under  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  after 

considering  the  available  preferential  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and  allowances,  and  on  the  estimated 

assessable profit of entities within the Group established in the Mainland of China for the years ended 31 

December 2021 and 2020. The general PRC CIT rate is 25% in 2021 and 2020.

Certain subsidiaries of the Group  in  the Mainland  of China  were approved  as High and  New Technology 

Enterprise and they were subject to  a preferential corporate  income  tax  rate  of 15%  for  the  years ended 

31 December 2021 and 2020. Moreover, according to the announcement and circular issued by relevant 

government  authorities,  a  subsidiary  was  qualified  as  national  key  software  enterprise  and  subject  to  a 

preferential corporate income tax rate of 10%.

In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to other tax concessions, mainly including the 

preferential policy of “2-year exemption and 3-year half rate concession” and the preferential tax rate of 15% 

applicable to some subsidiaries located in certain areas of the Mainland of China upon fulfillment of certain 

requirements of the respective local governments.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other jurisdictions

Income tax on profit arising from other jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Asia and South 

America,  had  been  calculated  on  the  estimated  assessable  profit  for  the  year  at  the  respective  rates 

prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions, ranging from 12.5% to 35%.

(v)  Withholding tax

According  to  applicable  tax  regulations  prevailing  in  the  PRC,  dividends  distributed  by  a  company 

established in the Mainland of China to a foreign investor with respect to profit derived after 1 January 2008 

are generally subject to a 10% withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong, under the 

double taxation arrangement between the Mainland of China and Hong Kong, the relevant withholding tax 

rate applicable to such foreign investor will be reduced from 10% to 5% subject to the fulfilment of certain 

conditions.

Dividends  distributed  from  certain  jurisdictions  that  the  Group’s  entities  operate  in  are  also  subject  to 

withholding tax at respective applicable tax rates.

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption of 

the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted by 

the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS).

In addition, the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (numerator) has been adjusted by the effect of 

the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, 

excluding those which have anti-dilutive effect on the Group’s diluted EPS.

The majority of the Group’s contributions to pension plans are related to the local employees in the PRC. All local employees of the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 are listed 

below:

Pension insurance

Medical insurance

Unemployment insurance

Housing fund

Percentage

12.0 ~ 20.0%

5.0 ~ 10.0%

The Group has announced policies which become effective on 1 January 2022, that, additional employee benefits will 

be provided by the Group to certain employees, including (i) commercial health insurance benefits to certain eligible 

employees who have completed a required period of service; and (ii) one-off retirement cash bonus upon the retirement 

of the qualified employees. The financial impacts relating to these employee benefits for the year ended 31 December 

2021 were immaterial.

15  DIVIDENDS (continued)

(b) 

Interim dividend by way of distribution in specie

As announced on 23 December 2021 (the “Declaration Date”), the Company resolved to declare a special interim 

dividend in the form of a distribution in specie of approximately 457 million Class A ordinary shares of JD.com 

(“JD.com Shares”) to the shareholders whose names appeared on the register of members of the Company on 

25 January 2022 in proportion to their then respective shareholdings in the Company on the basis of 1 Class A 

ordinary share of JD.com for every 21 shares held by the shareholders, being rounded down to the nearest whole 

number of Class A ordinary shares of JD.com and fractional entitlements to the JD.com Shares will be distributed 

in the form of cash-in-lieu payment, except that the net proceeds of less than HKD100 will not be distributed. 

Accordingly, approximately 457 million Class A ordinary shares of JD.com are expected to be distributed (“JD.com 

Shares to be distributed”), representing approximately 14.7% of the total number of issued shares of JD.com as at 

the Declaration Date.

These JD.com Shares to be distributed (Note 21(b)) are classified and presented as “Assets held for distribution” 

upon the Declaration Date (Note 32).

Dividends payable for distribution in specie of approximately RMB97.1 billion was recognised on the Declaration 

Date  and  measured  at  fair  value  using  the  market  price  of  the  JD.com  Shares  to  be  distributed.  Subsequent 

changes in the fair value of the said dividends payable as a result of the changes in the fair value of the JD.com 

Shares to be distributed was recognised in equity  as an adjustment  to the amount of  the dividend distribution 

until its settlement. Fair value changes on the dividends payable amounting to approximately RMB5.4 billion were 

recognised in equity since the Declaration Date up to 31 December 2021. As at 31 December 2021, the amount 

of dividends payable for distribution in specie was approximately RMB102.5 billion.

The share certificates for the JD.com Shares to be distributed are dispatched to the qualifying shareholders in 

March 2022.

Some leases of computer and other operating equipment contain variable lease payments. Variable payments are 

used for a variety of reasons, including managing cash outflows and minimising the fixed costs. Variable lease 

payments that depend on usage of bandwidth are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the conditions 

that trigger those payments occur. Variable lease payments relating to computer and other operating equipment 

leases during the year ended 31 December 2021 were considered to be insignificant.

The  total  cash  outflow  in  financing  activities  for  leases  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  was 

approximately RMB5,086 million (2020: RMB4,068 million), including principal elements of lease payments of 

approximately RMB4,423 million (2020: RMB3,537 million) and related interest paid of approximately RMB663 

million (2020: RMB531 million), respectively.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  amortisation  of  RMB28,595  million  (2020:  RMB26,758  million)  and 

RMB2,835  million  (2020:  RMB2,315  million)  were  charged  to  cost  of  revenues  and  general  and  administrative 

expenses, respectively.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  impairment  losses  of  RMB8,713  million  (2020:  RMB4,780  million)  on 

goodwill and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions were charged to the consolidated income statement under 

“Other gains/(losses), net”, and RMB13 million were reversed from (2020: RMB92 million were charged to) “Cost of 

revenues”.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill was allocated to VAS segment with RMB101,345 million (31 December 2020: RMB104,688 million), Online 

Advertising segment with RMB6,478 million (31 December 2020: nil), FinTech and Business Services segment with 

RMB1,433 million (31 December 2020: RMB1,018 million) and Others segment with RMB2,917 million (31 December 

2020: RMB2,917 million).

The Group carries out its impairment testing on goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of 

CGUs to their carrying amounts. For the purpose of goodwill impairment review, the recoverable amount of a CGU (or 

groups of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

The  key  assumptions  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  recoverable  amounts  of  the  CGUs  (or  groups  of  CGUs)  under 

impairment testing were as follows:

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s online game business within VAS segment, fair value less costs of disposal was 

primarily determined based on ratios of EV (enterprise value) divided by EBITDA of several comparable public companies 

(range: 15-22x) (2020: range: 20-27x) multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU (or group of CGUs) and discounted 

for lack of marketability at a range of 10% to 20% (2020: 10% to 20%). The comparable public companies were chosen 

based on factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and financial risks etc.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)

Impairment tests for goodwill (continued)

For  goodwill  attributable  to  the  Group’s  online  music  business  and  online  literature  business  within  VAS  segment, 

FinTech and Business Services segment and television series and film production within Others segment, value in use 

using discounted cash flows was calculated, generally, based on five-year financial projections plus a terminal value 

related to cash flows beyond the projection period extrapolated at an estimated terminal growth rate of generally not 

more than 5% (2020: not more than 5%). Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 14% to 22% (2020: 13% to 23%) were 

applied, which reflected assessment of time value and specific risks relating to the industries that the Group operates 

in. Management leveraged their experiences in the industries and provided forecast based on past performance and 

their anticipation of future business and market developments. Key parameters applied in the financial projections for 

impairment review purpose also included revenue growth rates, on a compound annual basis, of not more than 25% 

(2020: not more than 22%).

Management has not identified any reasonably possible change in key assumptions that could cause carrying amounts 

of the above CGUs (or groups of CGUs) to exceed the recoverable amounts.

In light of the economic, operating environment and market uncertainties at the financial year end, the carrying amounts 

of the CGUs related to interactive live video business within VAS segment and Online Advertising segment have been 

reduced to their respective recoverable amounts through recognition of impairment loss against goodwill of RMB4,012 

million and RMB4,500 million respectively as a result of the impairment test performed as detailed below.

In the CGUs related to interactive live video business and Online Advertising segment, the recoverable amounts were 

determined  using  discounted  cash  flow  calculations  which  derived  from  five-year  period  financial  projections  with 

compound annual revenue growth rates of not more than 15% plus a terminal value calculated at a growth rate of not 

more than 5%. Pre-tax discount rate of 15% was applied in the discounted cash flows calculations, which reflected time 

value of money and the assessment of specific risks of the respective industries.

The  remaining  goodwill  allocated  to  the  CGUs  (or  groups  of  CGUs)  after  impairment  related  to  Online  Advertising 

segment  and  interactive  live  video  business  was  not  material  to  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  and 

therefore no sensitivity analysis was presented.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group’s additions to investments in associates mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

a consortium (the “UMG Consortium”) formed together with Tencent Music Entertainment Group (“TME”), a non wholly-

owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  and  certain  global  financial  investors  to  acquire  additional  10%  equity  interests  in 

Universal Music Group (“UMG”) from its parent company, Vivendi S.A.. The Group’s additional investment in the UMG 

Consortium  amounted  to  approximately  EUR975  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB7,792  million),  and  the 

investment remained as an associate;

(ii) 

the  Group  acquired  additional  ordinary  shares  of  an  existing  investee,  which  is  engaged  in  eCommerce  at  a  cash 

consideration  of  approximately  RMB3,554  million.  Upon  completion  of  the  additional  investment,  the  Group’s  equity 

interests  in  the  investee  have  been  increased  from  5.23%  to  6.26%.  Since  there  is  no  change  in  the  assessment  of 

significant influence, this investment continues to be considered as an associate of the Group;

(iii) 

the  Group  acquired  27%  shares  of  a  new  investee  engaged  in  games  development  at  a  cash  consideration  of 

approximately USD540 million (equivalent to approximately RMB3,474 million);

(iv) 

the Group acquired additional ordinary shares of an existing investee, which is engaged in games development at a cash 

consideration  of  approximately  RMB2,795  million.  Upon  completion  of  the  additional  investment,  the  Group’s  equity 

interests in the investee have been increased from 5% to 10%. Since there is no change in the assessment of significant 

influence, this investment continues to be considered as an associate of the Group; and

(v) 

new associates and additional investments in existing associates with an aggregate amount of approximately RMB33,673 

million during the year ended 31 December 2021, which are principally engaged in games development, eCommerce 

platform and other Internet-related businesses.

(b) 

During the year ended 31 December 2021, transfers mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

the  entire  investment  in  JD.com  of  the  Group  with  a  carrying  value  of  approximately  RMB39.0  billion  was  transferred 

from investment in an associate to financial instruments as a result of resignation of board representative and the Group 

irrevocably designated it as FVOCI (Note 25(iv)) with step down gain of approximately RMB78.0 billion recognised in “Other 

gains, net” (Note 7(a));

(ii) 

investment in an existing associate engaged in games development of approximately RMB6.6 billion transferred to FVOCI 

(Note 25(v)) as a result of retirement of board representative; and

(iii) 

investments in associates of approximately RMB33,982 million transferred from FVPL mainly due to conversion of the 

redeemable instruments into ordinary shares upon their IPOs or obtaining board representatives.

Note: (continued)

(c) 

Both external and internal sources of information of associates are considered in assessing whether there is any indication that 

the investment may be impaired, including but not limited to financial position, business performance and market capitalisation. 

The Group carries out impairment assessment on those investments with impairment indications, and the respective recoverable 

amounts of investments are determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

In  respect  of  the  recoverable  amount  using  value  in  use,  the  discounted  cash  flows  calculations  were  based  on  cash  flow 

projections estimated by management and the key assumptions adopted in these cash flow projections included revenue growth 

rates, profit margins and discount rates. In respect of the recoverable amount based on fair value less costs of disposal, the 

amount was calculated with reference to their respective market prices, or using certain key valuation assumptions including the 

selection of comparable companies, recent market transactions and liquidity discount for lack of marketability.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  an  aggregate  impairment  loss  of  approximately  RMB15,391  million  (2020: 

RMB5,254 million) has been recognised for associates with impairment indicators. The majority of these associates’ recoverable 

amounts were determined using fair value less costs of disposal where the fair value is determined according to the principle set 

out in Note 3.3.

Management  has  assessed  the  level  of  influence  that  the  Group  exercises  on  certain  associates  with  the  respective 

shareholding  below  20%  and  certain  associates  with  shareholding  over  50%  (voting  power  is  below  50%),  with 

total  carrying  amounts  of  RMB214,927  million  and  RMB18,675  million  as  at  31  December  2021,  respectively  (31 

December  2020:  RMB212,349  million  and  RMB15,936  million,  respectively).  Management  determined  that  it  has 

significant influence thereon through the board representation or other arrangements made, and it has no control or 

joint control over such investees as the Group has no power to direct relevant activities due to other arrangements made. 

Consequently, these investments have been classified as associates.

There were no material contingent liabilities relating to the Group’s interests in the associates.

22 

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

As  at  31  December  2021,  the  Group’s  investments  in  joint  ventures  of  RMB6,614  million  (31  December  2020: 

RMB7,649 million) mainly comprised an investee company that is a special purpose vehicle of which the Group has a 

majority stake therein for the investment in one of the telecommunication carriers in the PRC and other joint venture 

initiatives in new retail and entertainment-related businesses.

Share of profit amounting to RMB148 million was recognised during the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: share of 

loss amounting to RMB76 million) (Note 10).

During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB904 million (2020: 

RMB1,388 million) against the carrying amounts of the investments in joint ventures, based on the respective assessed 

recoverable amounts.

significant influence, these investments have been classified as FVPL.

Some online advertising customers and agencies are usually granted with a credit period within 90 days immediately 

following the month-end in which the relevant obligations under the relevant contracted advertising orders are delivered. 

Third party platform providers usually settle the amounts due by them within 60 days. Other customers, mainly including 

content production related customers and FinTech and cloud customers, are usually granted with a credit period within 

90 days.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised 

from initial recognition of the assets. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over 

the expected life of the receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates.

34  OTHER RESERVES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with  limited  liabilities  in  the  PRC,  appropriation  of  net  profit  (after  offsetting  accumulated  losses  from  prior  years)  should  be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profit (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 35(d)).

(d) 

The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity instruments in other comprehensive 

income.  These  changes  are  accumulated  with  FVOCI  reserve  with  equity.  The  Group  transfers  amounts  from  this  reserve  to 

retained earnings when the relevant equity instruments are derecognised.

(e) 

During the year ended 31 December 2021, the acquisition of additional equity interests in non wholly-owned subsidiaries mainly 

comprised the additional acquisition of equity interest of Halti S.A. (“Halti”), a non wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The 

Group acquired additional 12.81% equity interest of Halti based on the agreed purchase price. This transaction was accounted 

for as transaction with non-controlling interest, and the excess of considerations over the aggregate carrying amounts of acquired 

non-controlling interests of RMB2,409 million was recognised directly in equity.

35  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted five share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II, the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option  Scheme I, the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  II and  the  Post-IPO 

Option Scheme III expired on 31 December 2011, 23 March 2014, 16 May 2017 and 13 May 2019, respectively. 

Upon the expiry of these schemes, no further options would be granted under these schemes, but the options 

granted prior to such expiry continued to be valid and exercisable in accordance with provisions of the schemes. 

As at 31 December 2021, there were no outstanding options exercisable of the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-

IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme III.

In respect of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV which continues to be in force, the Board may, at its discretion, grant 

options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms and conditions 

stipulated  therein.  The  exercise  price  must  be  in  compliance  with  the  requirement  under  the  Listing  Rules.  In 

addition, the option vesting period is determined by the Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year 

period for the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV after the date of grant of option.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  the  Company  allowed  certain  grantees  under  the  Post-IPO  Option 

Scheme  II  and  the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  IV  to  surrender  their  rights  to  receive  a  portion  of  the  underlying 

shares (with equivalent fair value) to set off against the exercise price and/or individual income tax payable when 

they exercised their options.

(a)  Share option schemes (continued)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Binomial Model to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2021 was HKD178.35 per share (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB149.72  per  share)  (2020:  HKD115.13  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately 

RMB104.72 per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend  yield  and  expected  volatility,  are  required  to  be  made  by  the  directors  in  applying  the  Binomial 

Model, which are summarised as below.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted three share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”) as of 31 December 2021, 

which are administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group. The vesting period of the awarded 

shares is determined by the Board.

Movements in the number of awarded shares for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  40,500  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent  non-

executive directors of the Company (2020: 59,500 awarded shares were granted to five independent non-executive 

directors of the Company).

As  a  result  of  the  Distribution  in  Specie  (Note  15(b)),  pursuant  to  the  scheme  rules  of  the  2013  Share  Award 

Scheme and the 2019 Share Award Scheme, adjustments had been made to the number of shares subject to 

share  awards  which  remained  unvested  as  at  the  Ex-dividend  Date.  Please  refer  to  the  announcement  of  the 

Company dated 14 March 2022 for details.

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2021  was 

HKD569.60  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB476.25  per  share)  (2020:  HKD481.61  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB431.90 per share)).

(b)  Share award schemes (continued)

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2021 were divided into one to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from one 

month to five years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(c)  Employee investment schemes

For aligning the interests of key employees with the Group, the Group established several employees’ investment 

plans in the form of limited liability partnerships (the “EIS”) among which the six EISs approved/established in 

2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2021 are in effect as at 31 December 2021. According to the term  of the  EISs, 

the Board may, at its absolute discretion, invite any qualifying participants of the Group, excluding any director 

of the Company, to participate in the EISs by subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. The 

participating employees are entitled to the economic benefits generated by the EISs, if any, after a specified vesting 

period under the respective EISs, ranging from four to seven years. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company 

acting  as  general  partner  of  these  EISs  administer  and  in  essence,  control  the  EISs.  These  EISs  are  therefore 

consolidated by the Company as structured entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 were 

insignificant to the Group.

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the respective board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion 

and in accordance with the relevant rules. The share options or restricted shares of the subsidiaries granted are 

normally  vested  by  several  tranches.  Participants  of  some  subsidiaries  have  the  right  to  request  the  Group  to 

repurchase their vested equity interests of the respective subsidiaries (“Repurchase Transaction”). The Group has 

discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction either by using equity instruments of the Company or by cash. For 

the Repurchase Transaction which the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company are currently of 

the view that some of them would be settled by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are accounted 

for using the equity-settled share-based payment method. For some of them settled in cash, they are accounted 

for using cash-settled share-based payment method.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2021, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be not 

lower than 89% (31 December 2020: not lower than 91%).

42  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(a)  Privatisation of Sogou

On 23 September 2021, the Group completed the privatisation of Sogou, an existing listed associate (NYSE: SOGO; 

with equity interests held of approximately 39%) of the Group, at a cash consideration of approximately USD2,135 

million (equivalent to approximately RMB13,812 million) for all of the  remaining  interest (“Privatisation”). As  a 

result of the Privatisation, Sogou became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The existing equity interest (of 

approximately 39%) held under investment in an associate was re-measured to fair value and resulted in step up 

gain of approximately RMB3,807 million (Note 7(a)(iii)).

Goodwill  of  approximately  RMB10,978  million  was  recognised  as  a  result  of  the  transaction.  It  was  mainly 

attributable  to  the  operating  synergies  and  economies  of  scale  expected  to  be  derived  from  combining  the 

operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose.

The following table summarises the purchase consideration, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as 

at the acquisition date of Sogou.

42  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (continued)

(a)  Privatisation of Sogou (continued)

Note:

The Group’s revenue for the year ended 31 December 2021 would be increased by not more than 5% and results for the year 

ended 31 December 2021 would not be materially different should the transaction have occurred on 1 January 2021.

The related transaction costs of the transaction are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial information.

(b)  Other business combinations

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  the  Group  also  acquired  certain  insignificant  subsidiaries.  The 

aggregate considerations for these acquisitions were approximately RMB10,854 million, fair value of net assets 

acquired  (including  identifiable  intangible  assets),  non-controlling  interests  and  goodwill  recognised  were 

approximately RMB3,862 million, RMB1,289 million and RMB8,281 million, respectively.

The revenue and the results contributed by these acquired subsidiaries for the period since respective acquisition 

date were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different 

if these acquisitions have occurred on 1 January 2021.

The related transaction costs of these business combinations are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial 

statements.

For the year ended 31 December 2021

48  SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTROLLED STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

In September 2020, TME issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of USD800 million due in 5 

years to 10 years, with interest rate ranging from 1.375% to 2.000%. As at 31 December 2021, the principal amount and net 

book balance of its notes payable were USD800 million and USD794 million (equivalent to RMB5,101 million and RMB5,062 

million), respectively.

(c) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non wholly-owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non wholly-owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(d) 

All  subsidiaries’  undertakings  are  included  in  the  consolidation.  The  proportion  of  the  voting  rights  in  the  subsidiary’s 

undertakings held directly by the parent company does not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company 

does not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(e) 

Significant restrictions

As  at  31  December  2021,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  term  deposits  and  restricted  cash  of  the  Group,  amounting  to 

RMB152,662 million were held in the Mainland of China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and 

treasury regulations. The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment 

of dividends, share repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(f) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 35(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 35(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes 

  which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2021,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB2,827  million  (2020:  RMB1,865 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
