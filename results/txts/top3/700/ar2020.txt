Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Strategic Progress and Outlook

Our key strategic priorities include cultivating our leading position in the Consumer Internet, embracing opportunities brought 

by the Industrial Internet, and energizing our corporate culture. During 2019, we believe we made substantial progress on 

prominent aspects of our corporate strategy, and we see scope for further development, leading us to continue to evolve our 

plans as we try to tackle new challenges and seize new opportunities. Reviewing some of our important product areas and 

business lines:

Communication and Social

Our strategic focus in this business is strengthening connections between users via digital content, online services, and offline 

services, as well as enhancing connections with enterprises leveraging Mini Programs, Weixin Pay and WeChat Work.

In 2019, we provided Weixin users with convenient access to public services and healthcare content. We enriched content in 

Mini Programs and news feeds services in video format and enabled users to share short videos via Weishi within Moments. 

Weixin and WeChat engagement metrics stayed high as their active user base and user time spent increased. Daily messages 

sent were up 15% year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2019. We rejuvenated QQ with enhanced chat features and friend 

recommendation,  and  we  expanded  entertainment  use  cases  via  Mini  Games,  increasing  QQ’s  popularity  among  younger 

generations. Since the coronavirus outbreak, QQ School-plus-Home groups have served more than 120 million users, with 

optimised  features  such  as  live  broadcast,  online  tutoring  programs  and  online  administrative  tools  for  school  routines  to 

facilitate online and offline education. To strengthen our connections with enterprises, we facilitated discovery of merchants’ 

Mini Programs and sales conversion by enhancing Weixin in-app search and live broadcast functions. The number of daily 

transactions generated within Mini Programs more than doubled year-on-year, and their transaction value exceeded RMB800 

billion in 2019.

Looking forward, we seek to make our users’ everyday life more convenient through our communication products, to develop 

the full potential of Mini Programs, and to introduce new social experiences enabled by technology innovations.

Annual Report 2019Chairman’s StatementOnline Games

In our online games business, our strategic focus was on enhancing our internal R&D capability and external partnerships, and 

expanding our overseas business.

During  2019,  we  extended  our  China  leadership  and  made  notable  progress  in  our  overseas  business,  largely  due  to  the 

success of our  games PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty Mobile, as well as  the new mode Teamfight Tactics  within  LoL. Our 

international games revenues more than doubled year-on-year, constituting 23% of our online games revenue in the fourth 

quarter of 2019. As of the end of 2019, five out of the top ten most-popular smart phone games by DAU internationally were 

developed by us. In addition to establishing our original IP franchises, we developed external partnerships via a number of 

new investments in best-in-genre studios. Key studios such as Timi and Lightspeed & Quantum under Tencent, as well as Riot 

Games and Supercell, have enhanced their R&D capability, and each have several promising games in its pipeline. We believe 

our studios are industry leaders on PC and smart phone games, and in genres such as multi-player battle arena and tactical 

tournament, but still have room to enhance our capabilities in other genres such as role-playing games. Leveraging our flagship 

games franchises, we strengthened our eSports global leadership with LoL’s World Championship and Honour of Kings’ KPL, 

which were the most watched events for PC and smart phone games, respectively.

Looking forward, we will seek to extend our domestic game industry leadership, reinforce our international efforts, and provide 

high quality new games globally.

Digital Content

In digital content, we focus on investing in digital content and growing our subscription business, and extending our franchise 

in long form video to short form video.

In  2019,  our  fee-based  VAS  subscriptions  increased  12%  year-on-year  to  180  million.  We  experienced  slower  subscriber 

and  revenue  growth  for  our  video  subscription  service  in  2019  than  2018,  reflecting  delays  in  broadcasting  key  content; 

however our Tencent Video subscriptions reached 106 million, and we remained the clear industry leader in terms of content, 

users, and financial metrics, reducing our 2019 operating loss to below RMB3 billion, substantially lower than the loss rates 

of industry peers. We are increasingly skilled at commissioning and creating in-house content, especially in areas such as 

drama series, anime series, and variety shows. We have extended our owned IP, such as Joy of Life (慶餘年), from online 

novels into successful TV drama series. We accelerated our music subscriber growth in the second half of 2019, benefitting 

from the pay-for-streaming model. Our literature subscriber growth was weak for much of 2019 due to competition from free 

reading services, but we are seeing signs of improvement, as our Weixin Reading app becomes more popular, and as readers 

differentiate the generally higher quality of paid content. 

6

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementDuring  2019,  we  have  aggressively  stepped  up  our  investment  in  the  short  form  video  space,  given  users  are  spending 

substantial time watching such videos. As a result of our efforts, our short video app Weishi increased its DAU 80% and daily 

uploads 70% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2019. We enhanced our video content recognition technology to enhance 

user content creation and make smarter content recommendations. We added innovative features such as video red packets 

to  boost  social  video  uploads  and  leveraged  in-house  IPs  to  support  content  creation  by  key  opinion  leaders  (KOLs)  and 

multi-channel networks (MCNs). We are in the early stages of what we expect to be a multi-year investment in short form 

video, but the fact that we overcame a late start in long form video to become the industry’s leader, together with our ability to 

leverage our social network and media properties, and our substantial progress in recent months, gives us confidence in our 

long term prospects in short form video.

Online Advertising

In advertising, we seek to enhance our user targeting capability to increase ROIs (return on investments) for advertisers.

During the first half of 2019, weak macro-economic conditions and competition for advertising spending negatively impacted 

our advertising business. However, the unification of our advertising technology and sales teams, enhanced user targeting, as 

well as simplified inventories and advertiser tools enabled us to re-establish business momentum from the second half of 2019 

in our core “social and others” advertising category, which accounted for the large majority of our total advertising revenue in 

the fourth quarter of 2019. Specifically, we extended the maximum number of ad impressions per user day in Weixin Moments 

from two to three in early 2019, and successfully tested a fourth impression in late 2019. Leveraging our data and technology, 

we believe we have taken substantial market share in ad networks, where we have experienced robust revenue growth and 

improved operating margin. Our media advertising business was hurt by delays in broadcasting certain drama series and less 

advertising activities around NBA basketball games.

Looking forward, we believe our competitive position in advertising has notably improved, and despite industry challenges, we 

enter 2020 with the right team and technology to enhance advertiser ROIs and increase our advertising market share, while 

continuing to provide appealing consumer experiences.

Annual Report 2019Chairman’s StatementFinTech

In FinTech, we strive to drive payment innovation, add payment use cases, and expand our wealth management portfolio.

During 2019, we strengthened our leadership in mobile payment services through deepening our penetration among offline 

merchants.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019,  we  exceeded  1  billion  daily  average  transactions  for  our  commercial  payments, 

covered  over  800  million  monthly  active  users,  and  worked  with  over  50  million  monthly  active  merchants.  We  launched 

Weixin Pay Scores which enhanced users’ purchase propensity and loyalty to merchants through features such as waiving 

creditworthy  users  their  deposits  on  some  rental  use  cases.  Our  wealth  management  platform,  LiCaiTong,  increased  its 

aggregate  customer  assets  over  50%  year-on-year,  while  its  number  of  customers  more  than  doubled  year-on-year  as  we 

expanded into the mass market. Our affiliate WeBank rapidly grew the loan balances of its micro-loan product, WeiLiDai, within 

Weixin, while maintaining a healthy non-performing loan ratio.

Looking forward, we will seek to extend our payment use cases, provide new FinTech products and services, and enhance the 

underlying capabilities and stability of our platform.

Cloud and Business Services

In Cloud and Business Services, we focus on developing customized industry solutions, enabling our enterprise partners to 

better connect with our users, and assisting a range of industries in digital upgrades.

Our cloud services revenues exceeded RMB17 billion in 2019, as we consistently outgrew the market. Our number of paying 

customers exceeded 1 million, benefitting from enhanced sales team and deeper partnerships with system integrators. Gross 

margins improved as we optimized supply chains and expanded business scale. We increased our market share and gained 

presence in verticals such as Internet services, tourism, municipal services and industrial sectors, leveraging our consumer 

reach  to  assist  enterprises  in  their  digital  upgrades.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  delaying  customers’  implementation  of 

cloud-related initiatives and will thus negatively impact our near-term cloud services revenues, but we believe enterprises will 

be increasingly keen to adopt cloud-based solutions over the longer term, in order to facilitate remote working and remote 

interactions with their customers.

8

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s Statement2020’s COVID-19 pandemic highlights the utility of remote working and remote health care services, and we are seeking to 

play our part in helping people cope with the new challenge. Tencent Meeting exceeded 10 million DAUs within two months 

since  its  launch  in  late  December  2019,  by  far  the  most-used  dedicated  video  conferencing  app  in  China.  We  deepened 

the integration between Weixin and WeChat Work to facilitate customer management and sales conversion, and millions of 

enterprises used WeChat Work to resume work in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Over 300 million Weixin users have 

utilized Tencent Health as an important access to real-time pandemic data, online consultation and AI-powered self-diagnosis 

services. We provided our medical AI imaging capabilities to assist diagnosis of coronavirus disease. We also offered reliable 

and professional medical information through Tencent Medipedia, and distributed pandemic-related content via multiple high-

traffic platforms, such as Weixin and Tencent News, attracting over 600 million page views. Tencent Health Code becomes the 

most used ePass for verifying health and travel history during the outbreak. 900 million users across more than 300 cities and 

counties have used our Health Code since it was available in this February, with a total of 8 billion visits. Looking forward, we 

will seek to both meet the immediate needs for our products brought about by the pandemic, and develop our capabilities to 

anticipate and serve enterprises’ long term demands as the economy digitizes.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives

We  made  notable  progress  on  our  ESG  performance  in  2019  in  areas  such  as  1)  technology  education,  2)  rural  poverty 

alleviation, 3) environmental conservation, 4) cultural inheritance and 5) board diversity.

We inaugurated an Xplorer Prize with an initial funding of RMB1 billion, which has recognized 50 outstanding scientists, in 

order to support fundamental science and cutting-edge technology research.

WeCounty Platform, our initiative to facilitate digitalisation and thus poverty alleviation in China’s rural areas, has connected 

15,000 villages in 29 provinces, serving over 2.5 million villagers as at the end of 2019.

Energy consumption efficiency and the use of renewable energy in local power grids have become important components of 

our site selection criteria for data centers. In 2019, we piloted recycling of waste heat in our Tianjin Data Center, which will help 

reduce energy consumption by approximately 1,600 tons of coal each year. Our Guangming Data Center, located in Shenzhen, 

was rated as AAAAA (the highest level) in the evaluation of green data centers organized by the Open Data Center Committee 

and other authorities, showcasing our leadership in energy saving.

On  cultural  preservation,  we  cooperated  with  renowned  museums  worldwide  to  promote  cultural  inheritance.  In  2019,  we 

deepened cooperation with the Palace Museum in Beijing to support the digitalization of 100,000 cultural relics in the next 

three years. We also established a partnership with National Museums Union of France (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to 

build digital museums to bring Chinese national treasures around the world to our users.

More details are set out in the “Environmental, Social and Governance Report” on pages 97 to 126 of this annual report.

9

Annual Report 2019Chairman’s StatementOur signature charity event, the annual “99 Giving Day”, engaged 48 million netizens and over 2,500 enterprises, and raised 

approximately RMB2.5 billion in 2019. Tencent Group donated RMB850 million to the Tencent Foundation in 2019, bringing 

our cumulative donations to RMB4.3 billion.

We diversified our board with the inclusion of Professor Ke Yang, who broadens our board’s perspectives and brings expertise 

in healthcare. She is the Director of Laboratory of Genetics of Peking University Cancer Hospital and an international member 

of the United States National Academy of Medicine.

As  we  entered  2020,  we  faced  the  challenges  of  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  which  has  profoundly  impacted  the  global 

economy. We responded by establishing a RMB1.5 billion emergency fund to offer relief support and by leveraging our cloud 

resources and technology to support pandemic-related program development and medical research. Our teams have worked 

relentlessly to upgrade our capabilities and products to update the public with authoritative news and information related to the 

pandemic, and to provide access to healthcare services, businesses and educational establishments with remote workplace 

and  collaborative  tools.  We  also  cooperated  with  Dr.  Zhong  Nanshan  to  fund  his  coronavirus  research  and  provided  our 

medical AI imaging capabilities to assist developing a quick test for COVID-19. We believe these efforts embody our mission, 

“Value for Users, Tech for Good”.

DIVIDEND

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD1.20 per share (2018: HKD1.00 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2019, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2020 AGM. Such proposed dividend will be 

payable on 29 May 2020 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 20 May 

2020.

APPRECIATION

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like  to  express  our  heartfelt  gratitude  to  our  conscientious  and  professional  staff  and 

management team for their hard work during the past year. I would also like to extend our thanks and appreciation to our 

shareholders and stakeholders who continue to provide us with great support and confidence. We believe that our continued 

commitment to building an ecosystem in the Consumer Internet and Industrial Internet sectors that brings the needs of our 

users to the forefront will produce long-term value for our shareholders.

Total revenues

－  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 13% year-on-year to RMB200 billion. Online games revenues grew by 

10% to RMB114.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to revenue contributions from domestic smart phone games 

including  Honour  of  Kings  and  Peacekeeper  Elite,  as  well  as  increased  contributions  from  our  overseas  titles  such 

as PUBG Mobile and Supercell titles, partly offset by the revenue decline from PC client games such as DnF. Social 

networks revenues increased by 17% to RMB85,281 million. The increase mainly reflected revenue growth from digital 

content services such as live broadcast services and video streaming subscriptions.

－  Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 39% year-on-year to RMB101.4 billion. The increase was 

primarily driven by greater revenues from commercial payment due to increased daily active consumers and number of 

transactions per user. Greater revenues from cloud services also contributed to the annual growth.

－  Revenues  from  Online  Advertising  business  increased  by  18%  year-on-year  to  RMB68,377  million.  Social  and 

others  advertising  revenues  grew  by  33%  to  RMB52,897  million.  The  increase  mainly  reflected  higher  advertising 

revenues derived from Weixin (primarily Weixin Moments and Mini Programs) as a result of its increased inventories 

and  impressions,  as  well  as  contributions  from  our  mobile  advertising  network  due  to  increased  traffic  and  video 

inventories.  Media  advertising  revenues  decreased  by  15%  to  RMB15,480  million.  The  decrease  was  primarily  due 

to  lower  advertising  revenues  from  our  media  platforms  including  Tencent  Video  and  Tencent  News  resulting  from 

unpredictability in broadcast schedules and the challenging macro-environment, as well as  the absence of  the FIFA 

World Cup in year 2019.

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and AnalysisCost of revenues.  Cost  of  revenues  increased  by  23%  year-on-year  to  RMB209.8  billion.  The  increase  primarily  reflected

to 56% for the year ended 31 December 2019 from 55% for the year ended 31 December 2018. The following table sets forth

Total cost of revenues

－ 

Cost of revenues for VAS increased by 27% year-on-year to RMB94,086 million. The increase was mainly due to greater 

content costs for services and products such as live broadcast services, online games and video streaming subscriptions, 

as well as channel costs for smart phone games.

－ 

Cost of revenues for FinTech and Business Services increased by 35% year-on-year to RMB73,831 million. The increase 

primarily reflected greater costs of payment-related and cloud services due to the enhanced scale of our payment and 

cloud activities.

－ 

Cost of revenues for Online Advertising decreased by 6% year-on-year to RMB34,860 million. The decrease was mainly 

driven by lower content costs for our advertising-funded long form video service resulting from fewer content releases 

and improved cost efficiency, partly offset by other cost items.

Annual Report 2019Management Discussion and AnalysisOther gains, net. We recorded net other gains totalling RMB19,689 million for the year ended  31 December 2019,  which 

primarily  comprised  of  non-IFRS  adjustment  items  such  as  fair  value  gains  arising  from  increased  valuations  for  certain 

investee companies in verticals such as FinTech services, social media and education, as well as net deemed disposal gains 

arising from the capital activities of certain investee companies in verticals including transportation services and online games.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 12% to RMB21,396 million for the year ended 

31  December  2019  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  The  decrease  was  mainly  due  to  the  reduction  of  advertising  and  promotion 

expenses  as  a  result  of  improved  operational  efficiencies.  As  a  percentage  of  revenues,  selling  and  marketing  expenses 

decreased to 6% for the year ended 31 December 2019 from 8% for the year ended 31 December 2018.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 29% to RMB53,446 million for the 

year ended 31 December 2019 on a year-on-year basis. The increase was primarily driven by greater R&D expenses and staff 

costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 14% for the year ended 31 December 

2019 from 13% for the year ended 31 December 2018.

RMB1,681 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to share of profit of RMB1,487 million for the year ended

Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased by 7% to RMB13,512 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 on a 

year-on-year basis. The decrease mainly reflected the entitlements of preferential tax treatments and benefits.

to RMB93,310 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 on a year-on-year basis. Non-IFRS profit attributable to equity

Online  games  revenues  grew  by  25%  to  RMB30,286  million.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  revenue  growth 

from smart phone games in both domestic and overseas markets, including titles such as Peacekeeper Elite and PUBG 

Mobile,  as  well  as  revenue  contributions  from  Supercell  titles,  partly  offset  by  lower  revenues  from  PC  client  games 

such as DnF. Social networks revenues increased by 13% to RMB22,022 million. The increase mainly reflected greater 

contributions  from  digital  content  services  such  as  live  broadcast  and  music  streaming  services.  Total  smart  phone

driven  by  advertising  revenue  growth  from  Weixin  Moments  and  our  mobile  advertising  network.  Media  advertising 

revenues decreased by 24% to RMB3,951 million. The decrease primarily reflected lower advertising revenues from 

our media platforms including Tencent Video and Tencent News due to uncertain broadcasting schedules and fewer 

telecasts of sports events.

NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-IFRS financial 

measures (in terms of operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, net margin, profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS) have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-IFRS financial 

measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared 

in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-IFRS financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by 

other companies.

22

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and Analysis 
 
 
 
The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-IFRS  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  Group’s  core  operations  by  excluding  certain  non-cash  items  and  certain 

impact of M&A transactions. In addition, non-IFRS adjustments include relevant non-IFRS adjustments for the Group’s major 

associates  based  on  available  published  financials  of  the  relevant  major  associates,  or  estimates  made  by  the  Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

The following tables set forth the reconciliations of the Group’s non-IFRS financial measures for the fourth quarter of 2019

As at 31 December 2019, the Group had net debt of RMB15,552 million, compared to net debt of RMB7,173 million as at 30 

September 2019. The sequential increase in indebtedness mainly reflected payments for M&A initiatives and media contents, 

as well as the consolidation of indebtedness at Halti, partly offset by strong free cash flow generation.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019,  the  Group  had  free  cash  flow  of  RMB37,896  million.  This  was  a  result  of  net  cash  flow

Note:

1. 

The first 25% of the total options can be exercised 1 year after the commencement dates as specified in the relevant grant letters, and 

each 12.5% of the total options will become exercisable in each subsequent six months.

2. 

All the options can be exercised 1 year after the commencement date as specified in the relevant grant letter if a certain condition is 

satisfied.

3. 

Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the first 25% of the total options can be exercised on the dates as specified in the 

relevant grant letters, and each 25% of the total options will become exercisable in each subsequent year.

4. 

The first 25% of the total options can be exercised 2 years after the commencement dates as specified in the relevant grant letters, and 

each 25% of the total options will become exercisable in each subsequent year.

5. 

The closing price immediately before the date on which the options were granted on 14 June 2019 was USD7.13.

6. 

The weighted average closing price immediately before the date on which the options were exercised was USD7.29.

7. 

The fair value of the options as at the respective grant date was determined using the “Enhanced FAS 123” binomial model which is to 

be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 

2019 was USD6.00 per share. Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant assumptions (which are subject to subjectivity 

and uncertainty) used to estimate the fair value of the options include risk free rate (2.08%), dividend yield (nil) and expected volatility* 

(40%).

* 

The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the share prices of similar United States and Hong Kong public companies 

for a period equal to the expected life preceding the grant date.

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportCONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with  the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by themselves or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History 

and Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group 

is able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts 

are also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to 

acquire the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2019, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has 

been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been removed.

59

Annual Report 2019Directors’ ReportRequirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2019

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening  the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games  and  the Examination and Approval of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定” 規定》和中央編辦有關解釋，進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進口

網絡遊戲審批管理的通知)  (the  “Circular  13”)  jointly  issued  by  PRC  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication,  the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly 

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

However, the Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between 

foreign online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether 

the  State  General  Administration  of  Press,  Publication,  Radio,  Film  and  Television  will  deem  the  Group’s  structure  and 

operations to be in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through OPCOs that hold the 

necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to Structure Contracts will be adopted or if adopted, 

what they  would provide. On 15 March 2019, the Standing Committee of National People’s Congress promulgated  Law  of 

Foreign Investment which became effective on 1 January 2020 (the “2019 Law of Foreign Investment”). While the 2019 Law of 

Foreign Investment does not define Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment explicitly, the Company cannot assure 

that future laws and regulations will not provide for Structure Contracts as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be 

no assurance that the Company’s control over OPCOs through Structure Contracts will not be deemed as foreign investment in 

the future. If the Structure Contracts were to be deemed as a method of foreign investment under any future laws, regulations 

and rules, and if any of the Company’s business operations were to fall under the “negative list” for foreign investment, the 

Company would need to take further actions in order to comply with these laws, regulations and rules, which may materially 

and adversely affect its current corporate structure, business, financial condition and results of operations.

carried  out  during  the  financial  year  had  been  entered  into  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Structure

by the OPCOs to the holders of their equity interests and the terms of any new Structure Contracts entered into, renewed and/

of the Company’s shareholders as a whole. To this extent, similar Structure Contracts were entered into relating to the New 

OPCOs.

The Auditor had carried out procedures on the transactions pursuant to the Structure Contracts and had provided a letter

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportThe risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due  to  the  legal  constraints  in  relation  to  foreign  investment  in  the  telecommunications  value-added  services  industry  in 

the PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the 

WFOEs derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these  

intra-group contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and 

adverse impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the 

tax treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

Other connected transactions

Save as the related parties transaction disclosed in Note 13(a) (Senior management’s emoluments), Note 13(b) (Five highest

investees  and  investees’  shareholders)  and  Note  34  (Share-based  payments)  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  no 

related parties transactions disclosed in the consolidated financial statements constitutes a discloseable connected transaction 

as defined under the Listing Rules. The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements set out in Chapter 14A of the

Annual Report 2019Directors’ ReportMaintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  are  based  on  the  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code.  The  Board 

believes that throughout the year ended 31 December 2019, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the roles of the chairman 

and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes 

when appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates  the  Company’s overall business strategy  and  monitors  management’s 

execution of such strategy.

The Board has defined the business and governance issues for which it needs to be responsible for, and these matters are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this 

regard, the Board:

(cid:127) 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;

(cid:127) 

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;

(cid:127) 

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual business plan and budget;

(cid:127) 

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned;

70

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report(cid:127) 

approves the Company’s financial statements and interim and annual reports;

(cid:127) 

determines the Group’s communication policy;

(cid:127) 

determines director selection, orientation and evaluation;

(cid:127) 

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control,  internal  audit  and  regulatory  compliance 

procedures in place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders;

(cid:127) 

establishes Board committees with clear terms of reference and responsibilities as appropriate;

(cid:127) 

defines levels of delegation in respect of specific matters, with required authority to Board committees and management;

(cid:127) 

monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the businesses of the Group;

(cid:127) 

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders; and

(cid:127) 

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness.

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long-term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specify its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

71

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportThe Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

(cid:127) 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor;

(cid:127)

able to take; and

reviews and monitors the implementation of the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy of the Company.

Remuneration Committee

(cid:127) 

reviews and approves proposals about the policy and structure of remuneration of directors and senior management 

team;

(cid:127) 

ensures that these remuneration proposals are aligned to corporate goals and objectives; and

(cid:127) 

ensures that no director or any of his associates is involved in deciding his own remuneration.

The major work of the committees during the year 2019 is set out on pages 79 to 84.

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring that Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for carrying out their 

functions.

73

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportWe believe education and training are important for maintaining  an effective Board.  New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2019, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The table below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2019:

Professor Ke Yang was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company with effect from 15 August 2019.

A high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot be maintained only with the Board’s efforts. Each of the Group’s 

employees plays a role in contributing to such cause. A code of conduct which emphasises integrity and respect is distributed 

by the Company to all employees and it forms part of the employment agreement with each of the employees.

74

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportIn  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

(cid:127) 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

(cid:127) 

training has been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

(cid:127) 

the company secretary attends training in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements; and

(cid:127) 

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in order to promote the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the roles of the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides,  all  major  decisions  have  been  made  in  consultation  with  members  of  the  Board  and  appropriate  committees,  as 

well as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to 

time to make presentations and answer the Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in 

all Board and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly 

briefed at the Board meetings, and he works with the senior management team to provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete 

and reliable information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is 

available for discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Chairman held a 

meeting with the independent non-executive directors without the presence of other directors as required by the Listing Rules.

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and make necessary 

changes when appropriate.

75

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportComposition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of nine directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors and five independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2019 and up to the date of this 

annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board except that Professor Ke Yang has been appointed as an 

independent non-executive director with effect from 15 August 2019.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 49 to 52 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A  of the  Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in a professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings  and  bring  professional  judgment  and  advice  on  issues  relating  to  the  Group’s  strategies,  policies,  performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. The non-executive directors also take the lead where potential 

conflicts  of  interests  arise  and  exercise  their  professional  judgment  and  utilise  their  expertise  to  scrutinise  the  Company’s 

performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor performance reporting.

Further,  in  compliance  with  Rule  3.10  of  the  Listing  Rules,  two  of  our  independent  non-executive  directors  have  the 

appropriate professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice 

from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation 

annually  of  their  independence  and  the  Nomination  Committee  has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all 

independent non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 

of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

76

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportAppointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2019 annual general meeting, Messrs Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker and Ian Charles Stone retired and were re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, there is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and 

development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to the sustainable development of the Group. Given 

the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

Professor Ke Yang was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company with effect from 15 August 2019.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial and 

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  company  secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the 

Board meeting to each of the directors at least 14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary 

also sends the agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in 
advance of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial 

performance and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as 

promptly and fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, 
such director will declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 
senior management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 

expense in appropriate circumstances.

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary

Huateng and Mr Charles St Leger Searle. The Investment Committee is chaired by Mr Lau Chi Ping Martin.

During 2019, the Nomination Committee considered and endorsed the new board nomination policy for the Board’s approval 

and  updated  its  terms  of  reference  to  include  its  duties  regarding  the  board  nomination  policy.  Nomination  Committee 

reviewed board composition and director succession, the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy, and also 

considered and made recommendations to the Board on the proposed appointment of Professor Ke Yang as an independent 

non-executive director and the re-appointment of the retiring directors at the 2019 annual general meeting. The Nomination 

Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive directors and considers all of them to be 

independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of the 

length of service of each independent non-executive director, and the perspectives, skills and experience that such director 

can bring to the Board. The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a 

business imperative that will help the Company achieve its strategic objectives and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, 

the Board has set measurable objectives for the implementation of the board diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the 

appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business 

strategy and maintain the effectiveness of the Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy 

and the board nomination policy are successfully implemented with reference to the measurable objectives. The Nomination 

Committee will continue to monitor the implementation of the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy and will 

review the board diversity policy and the board nomination policy periodically to ensure their continued effectiveness.

In view of the new requirements in respect of the disclosure of nomination policy adopted during the year under the revised 

CG Code, the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee were revised in March 2019 to include duties of the Nomination 

Committee regarding the board nomination policy.

81

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong 

Sheng (both are independent non-executive directors) and Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker (non-executive director). The 

Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Ian Charles Stone.

The Remuneration Committee met three times in 2019. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is 

set out on page 78.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration package of each director.

The Remuneration Committee’s major work during the year 2019 includes the following:

(cid:127) 

reviewing and recommending to the Board in respect of the remuneration policies and structure of the Company by 

benchmarking peer companies with a similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages are competitive

with the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate 

high  performing  individuals,  and  reflect  the  specifics  of  individual  roles.  For  further  details  of  emoluments  of  the  senior

84

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibilities, the Board ensures that the assessment over the Group’s performance and prospects 

are  clearly  and  comprehensively  presented.  The  directors  acknowledge  that  it  is  their  ultimate  responsibility  to  prepare 

the  accounts  which  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  financial  position  of  the  Group  on  a  going-concern  basis  and  other 

announcements  and  financial  disclosures.  To  assist  the  Board  in  discharging  their  responsibilities,  management  provides 

updates  to  the  Board  from  time  to  time,  including  the  Group’s  detailed  business  and  financial  position,  in  order  to  give 

the directors a balanced, understandable and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects  of the  Group. 

Management also provides all necessary and relevant information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and 

information they need to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information 

put before them for approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the 

“Independent Auditor’s Report” of this annual report.

Adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s strategic objectives. Risk management and internal control systems shall ensure the effective business operation, 

accuracy and reliability of the financial reporting, as well as the compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies.

The Board acknowledges that it is their responsibility to ensure that the Company has established and maintained adequate 

and effective risk management and internal control systems. The Board delegates their responsibility to the Audit Committee 

to  review  the  practices  of  management  with  respect  to  risk  management  and  internal  control,  including  the  design, 

implementation  and  supervision  of  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  Audit 

Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems on an annual basis. The Board 

is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the Company’s acceptable level of risk, 

and proactively considering, analysing and formulating strategies to manage the Company’s significant risks.

Under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  Board,  the  Company  has  adopted  a  risk  management  and  internal  control 

structure, referred to as the “Three Lines of Defence” model, to ensure the effectiveness of its risk management and internal 

control systems.

First Line of Defence – Operation and Management

Our First Line of Defence is mainly comprised of business and functional departments of each business group of the Company 

who  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operation  and  management.  They  are  responsible  for  designing  and  implementing 

controls to address the risks.

Second Line of Defence – Risk Management

Our Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. They are responsible for formulating policies related to the risk management 

and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk control systems. 

To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  such  systems,  they  also  assist  and  supervise  the  first  line  of  defence  in  the 

establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

85

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportThird Line of Defence – Independent Assurance

Our Third Line of Defence is comprised of the IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing an independent evaluation on the effectiveness 

of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems, and monitoring management’s continuous improvement over 

the risk management and internal controls.

The  Anti-fraud  Investigation  Department  is  responsible  for  receiving  whistleblower  reports  through  various  channels  and 

following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the  “Tencent Sunshine 

Code of Conduct” (the “Sunshine Code”) and the value of integrity to all employees of the Company.

The IA and the Anti-fraud Investigation Department have direct reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

The Three Lines of Defence model of the risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than 

eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 

material misstatement or loss.

The Board and management have always placed importance on the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 

In  2019,  the  Company  has  invested  more  resources  in  the  continuous  improvement  of  the  risk  management  and  internal 

control  systems,  which  have  also  continuously  increased  the  awareness  of  risk  management  among  the  employees.  The 

internal control function has continuously worked closely with and provided proactive support to the business groups in their 

business development and risk management. Furthermore, the IA has also continued to promote the deployment of various 

internal audit projects and continuous audits to provide more effective and timelier independent evaluations. The Anti-fraud 

Investigation Department further strengthened the values of integrity among the employees, followed up and investigated the 

alleged fraudulent activities. The connection and interaction among the three lines of defence have been further enhanced to 

provide more effective support to the Company’s development.

Risk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving its risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

and its risk management ability, to ensure long-term growth and sustainable development of the Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” internal monitoring model 

as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party in the system as well as the relevant 

risk management policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses 

any risks that may negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The 

Company also provides risk management and internal control training for staff on a regular basis.

86

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportRisk Management Process

Being an Internet and technology company with a wide variety of rapidly-changing businesses, the Company has adopted the 

following dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

(cid:127) 

Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

(cid:127) 

The  IC  collects,  analyses  and  consolidates  a  list  of  significant  risks  at  the  business  level,  and  provides  input  on  risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses and control measures  will  be reviewed by management  and subsequently by  the Audit Committee before 

reporting to the Board;

(cid:127) 

The IC analyses and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

(cid:127) 

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with support from the IC.

Significant Risks of the Company

In  2019,  management  has  identified  and  determined  nine  significant  risks  of  the  Company  through  the  risk  management 

process detailed above. As the Company’s business scale, scope and complexity have evolved, so as its external environment, 

management  considers  that  the  Company  is  still  facing  the  nine  significant  risks  disclosed  in  2018.  “Regulatory  and 

Compliance  Risk”,  “Market  Competition  and  Innovation  Risk”  and  “Information  Security  Risk”  have  been  increased  while 

“Acquisition & Investment Management Risk” has been reduced to a lower level. The other risks remain at the similar level as 

last year.

On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee supervises the overall risk status of the Company and assesses the change in 

the nature and severity of the Company’s major risks. The Audit Committee considers that management has taken appropriate 

measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a level acceptable to the Board.

87

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportBelow is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk 

profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

1.  Regulatory and compliance risk

The  Internet  and  technology  industry  is  still  evolving  yet  getting  more  mature.  Regulatory  authorities  in  different 

jurisdictions have been, in an attempt to keep up with such evolution, heightening respective regulatory requirements. 

As the Company continuously expands its businesses in the PRC and overseas to more countries and jurisdictions, it is 

required to keep up and comply with the relevant applicable laws and regulations in different countries and jurisdictions, 

including  but  not  limited  to  laws  relating  to  data  protection,  Internet  information  and  cyber  security,  IP,  gaming, 

Internet finance, etc. In addition, development of various industries around the world may be impacted by regulatory 

uncertainties.

The Company has invested enormous compliance resources and efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 

regulatory requirements. This includes setting up special departments and specialist teams, as well as engaging external 

professional consultants to work closely with management to track on changes in relevant laws and regulations; and 

take appropriate responding actions or measures to ensure the Company is in compliance with such applicable laws 

and regulations in PRC and overseas. In addition, the Company also engages in active dialogue with relevant regulatory 

authorities,  and  exchanges  view  and  information  with  relevant  regulatory  authorities  on  the  market  trends  and  the 

development of Internet and technology industry.

2.  Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet and technology industry is highly competitive, innovative and ever-changing at all times. The development of 

technologies brings evolutional changes to the existing business models; and the cross-sectoral expansion of non-Internet 

and technology companies bring in more new players into the market. Users’ expectations for innovative products and 

services are also increasing. Therefore, how to attract new users and stay competitive are still the key challenges of the 

Company. Any lagging in innovation and development of technology and product would impair the core competitiveness 

of the Company.

The Company stays on top of trends in market and industry development, as well as user needs, and keeps up with 

the technological development through innovation. Internally, the Company stays focused on expectation changes in 

user  experience,  stays  active  in  promoting  the  incubation  of  new  business,  keeps  exploring  new  forms  of  business, 

and recruits talent, optimises its organisational structure, and enhances the innovation capabilities by improving talent 

quality with cultivating young talent. The Company also continuously enhances its technical capabilities and innovation 

environment  to  develop  products  that  meet  the  expectations  of  the  market.  Externally,  the  Company  co-creates 

ecosystems through strategic investments and acquisitions, as well as collaboration with business partners. As always, 

the  Company  leverages  the  strength  of  the  new  ecosystems  to  seek  new  business  partners  to  explore  new  business 

opportunities and better approach to responding to the market needs and expectations. With the aim to promote “mutual 

benefit and win-win” concept, the Company has established a number of open platforms to incubate potential startup 

companies, and enhance its collaboration with business partners and its competitiveness in the market.

Information security risk

Protecting user and customer data is  the  top priority  of  the  Company,  and the Company is fully aware that  any  loss 

or leakage of such information could have a significant negative impact on the affected users and customers and the 

Company’s reputation. This could in turn lead to potential legal actions against the Company.

The Company is obliged to protect user and customer data, and as such, the Company strives to provide the highest 

level of protection on such information and data. In this regard, the Company has formulated and kept optimising control 

measures to protect such information and data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, 

encryption, access restrictions and controls, and continuously improving the business continuity and disaster recovery 

management. In addition, the Company arranges regular reviews by independent specialists over the Company’s data 

protection practices; and provides training for staff to enhance their awareness of information security.

4.  ToB business risk

The Company has actively developed various ToB businesses related to Industrial Internet. With the rapid development 

of the ToB business, if the Company fails to adjust its business strategy to timely respond to changes in industry trends 

and  market  needs,  to  keep  optimising  its  organisational  structure  with  support  from  professional  talents,  to  improve 

its  internal  management  system  and  processes  for  ToB  business;  and  to  improve  its  cooperation  mechanisms  with 

various business partners, it may affect the development of its ToB business and affect the achievement of its strategic 

objectives.

The  Company  is  accumulating  and  solidifying  its  experience  in  the  ToB  business,  it  does  so  by  analyzing  trends  in 

different industries and changes in user needs. The Company has started to increase its foot prints in ToB business and 

is providing supports to the companies in their digitalisation initiatives via Cloud and AI solutions. This has been applied 

across many industries including finance, education, etc. The Company is continuously developing its ToB business, 

and keeps optimising its management over business structure, human resources, management policies and business 

processes to ensure the effective operation of the ToB business for rapid and sustained development.

5.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high-quality user experience. Any material 

functional  defect,  interruption,  breakdown  or  other  issue  in  connection  is  likely  to  adversely  impact  the  Company’s 

businesses. In addition, the Company’s operations may be negatively affected or disrupted by the natural disasters, social 

security events, or epidemic diseases. Relevant incidents may damage workplaces and equipment that are vital to the 

Company and its business partners, and threaten the health of their employees.

89

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportThe Company has been continuously investing in the network infrastructure for its products and platforms to enhance its 

business recovery and continued capabilities for providing stable support to the business operations and development. 

Various business departments are also engaged in business continuity management to ensure the smooth operation of 

the Company’s business. In addition, the Company has established dedicated teams to develop business contingency 

plans  and  has  performed  periodic  drills  on  the  plans  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  The  dedicated  teams  have  also 

reviewed the plans as well as the result of the drills. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019, the Company 

has activated the emergency response mechanism in the business contingency plans including providing mobile office 

and various functional support, to support the business group in responding to urgent needs through adjusting resource 

allocation and timely deployment of emergency measures to ensure continued operations of the Company’s business. 

For  example,  the  Company  timely  expanded  the  capacity  of  Tencent  Meeting  to  meet  the  massive  needs  for  mobile 

work during the epidemic. Tencent Education actively responded to  “Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning”, 

to meet the sudden online education needs, and provide assurance for schools and students’ educational management 

and  online  learning.  The  Company  has  great  concerns  on  employee  safety.  On  top  of  meeting  the  basic  regulatory 

requirements, the Company has implemented additional measures and announced policies in a timely manner to further 

protect the safety of all employees.

6.  Crisis management, public relations and reputation risk

As one of the China’s largest technology companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses, products and investments, 

users and business partners, the Company always attracts very high attention from the public and media. The Company 

needs to consider possible crisis and actively respond to them, to avoid worsening of problems or escalation of crisis. 

The Company also needs to disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public; otherwise, it may damage the 

Company’s reputation, brand and image, and adversely affect the business and prospects of the Company.

In  response  to  crisis,  the  Company  has  established  the  corresponding  emergency  response  mechanism,  to  follow 

up on the progression of crisis, assess risks, make prompt decisions and adjust its businesses to reduce the impact. 

The Company has set up professional public relations department and teams for crisis management to continuously 

improve  its  crisis  management  and  public  relations  capabilities,  with  established  emergency  response  and  public 

relations management mechanisms. The crisis management teams have maintained close interaction with management 

and business groups, to continuously gather public opinions, analyse relevant market information for management to 

enable management timely respond and disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public according to the 

Company’s policies and procedures; and protect the Company’s reputation.

90

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report7.  Social responsibility risk

With the diverse products and platforms of the Company and its expanding user base, the products and platforms of 

the Company have gained considerable influence in wider society, and are subject to increased scrutiny from a social 

responsibility perspective.

“Value for Users, Tech for Good” is the Company’s new vision and mission launched on 11 November 2019. The “Tencent 

Game Guardian Platform” is established to lead the development of anti-indulgence system to prevent unhealthy gaming 

habits of juveniles. The Company provides more convenient solutions for public affairs and government services through 

the use of digital technology, such as the “Yue Sheng Shi” mini program. The Company promotes transformation of 

various industries, i.e. healthcare, education,  travel, tourism, etc., and creates  value  for  enterprises  and consumers. 

The  Company  uses  Internet  technology  and  its  technological  capabilities  to  improve  people’s  life  and  support  social 

and commercial industrial development. The “Xplore Prize” is initiated by the Company to encourage the study of key 

technologies and basic science. The Company promotes “Neo-Culture Creativity” to actively promote and enrich Chinese 

traditional culture in China and overseas. As China’s first Internet and technology enterprise with a charity foundation, 

the Company is committed to building trust through technology, to support the development of philanthropy.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in late 2019, the Company provided supports via technology and charity funding, 

and actively fought the epidemic together with the society through its products and platforms. The Company’s ability to 

effectively access users allows the creation of a variety of digital tools in the battle against the epidemic. In addition, the 

Company immediately set up a RMB1.5 billion charity foundation to help the society fight the epidemic through providing 

medical protection supplies, supporting basic scientific research, caring for anti-epidemic personnel, and supporting 

public management of the epidemic.

8.  Fraud risk

In  recent  years,  fraudulent  activities  have  occurred  frequently  in  the  Internet  and  technology  industry  and  therefore 

integrity  has been an important concern. As the Company continues developing its business, its business  scale  and 

complexity increased, and consequently the fraud risk inevitably increased to a certain extent. For example, fraudulent 

activities  caused  by  collusion  between  suppliers/business  partners  and  employees  can  have  a  negative  impact  on 

reputation and financial position of the Company.

91

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportThe Company, with its belief in the value of integrity, has zero tolerance for fraud, and is determined to fight against any 

fraudulent activities. The Company has established effective internal control systems and is continuously improving it. 

These systems have been strengthened by systematic, transparent control measures and procedures. To enhance and 

promote  integrity,  the  Company  continuously  conducts  various  training  and  propaganda  for  its  employees,  suppliers 

and business partners. For employees, the Company has established a Tencent Sunshine Code (the “Sunshine Code”) 

that the employees shall strictly follow during their employment and in the course of business dealing with suppliers 

and business partners. For suppliers and business partners, the Company cooperates with them to create an ecosystem 

with integrity. The Company has signed an Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration with its suppliers and business partners 

to  alert  the  counterparts  the  importance  of  ethical  value  and  to  build  a  healthy  and  transparent  environment  for 

business. Furthermore, the Company has set up an Anti-fraud Investigation Department for years to proactively collect 

whistleblowing cases from various channels, and to follow up and investigate alleged fraudulent cases on a timely basis. 

The Company will terminate the employment immediately with any employee who has been found to be involved in any 

fraudulent activities. The Company may also pass the relevant case for juridical process according to the relevant laws 

and regulations under more serious circumstances. Any supplier/business partner found to be involved in any fraudulent 

activities will be blacklisted and deprived of the opportunity to work with the Company permanently. The Company will 

announce to the public those criminal cases and serious abuse-of-power cases that were investigated and handled by 

the Company via the  “Sunshine Tencent” WeChat official platform. This shows the Company’s determination to fight 

corruption and fraud, as well as its commitment towards creating a virtuous and honest atmosphere within the Company 

and the industry.

9.  Acquisition and investment management risk

The  Company  has  a  certain  scale  of  investment  activities  in  diverse  fields.  It  is  important  for  the  Company  to  adopt 

robust procedures in the formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment 

evaluation stage as well as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly manage investment risks could hinder the 

realization of investment strategies and lead to probable financial loss of the Company.

The  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously,  and  has,  amongst  other  things,  established  an 

Investment Committee under the Board, dedicated an investment team to identify investment opportunities, appointed 

finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  manage  relevant  risks  and  put  in  place  the  investment  risk 

evaluation  and  approval  process.  There  is  also  a  designated  professional  team  that  regularly  reviews  the  Company’s 

treasury  position  and,  continuously  expands  its  financing  channels  and  capabilities  to  meet  the  needs  from  the 

Company’s  business  operations  as  well  as  acquisitions.  The  Company  has  also  designated  finance,  legal  and  other 

relevant professional teams to support and monitor the performance of the investee companies. These teams periodically 

analyse and review relevant operating and financial information of the investee companies to ensure that they continue 

to satisfy the Company’s investment strategies. In addition, the Company has invested resources in IA and IC to empower 

investee companies, and to continuously support the management of its controlling subsidiaries in establishing more 

sound risk management and internal control systems.

92

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportInternal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems  and  has  implemented  its  internal  control 

systems according to the COSO Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party as well as the authorisation 

and  approvals  required  for  the  key  actions  of  the  Company.  Policies  and  procedures  are  in  place  for  the  key  business 

processes. This information is clearly conveyed to employees in practice and emphasized the importance of the internal control 

systems. All employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational 

issues that set the control standards for the management of each business process.

In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework  and  guides 

the  management  of  each  business  group  to  carry  out  the  self-assessment.  The  IC  is  also  responsible  for  collecting 

and  summarising  the  results  of  self-assessment.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Company  reviews  this  summarised 

self-assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of management to the Audit Committee and the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensures that management has implemented appropriate measures and reports the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control

The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, continuously reviews the risk management and internal control systems.

The review process comprises of, among other things, meetings with management of business groups, IA, IC, legal team, and 

the external auditor, reviewing the relevant work reports and information of key performance indicators, the management’s 

self-assessment  on  internal  control  as  detailed  above  and  discussing  the  significant  risks  with  senior  management  of  the 

Company.

93

Annual Report 2019Corporate Governance ReportThe  Board  is  of  the  view  that  throughout  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  the  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems of the Company are effective and adequate.

In  addition,  the  Board  believes  that  the  Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  functions  have  been  performed  by 

staff  of  the  appropriate  qualifications  and  experience  and  that  such  staff  receives  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and 

development. Based on the report of the Audit Committee, the Board also believes that sufficient resources have been obtained 

for the Company’s internal audit function and that its staff qualifications and experience, training programmes and budgets are 

sufficient.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of the 

Group’s operations, businesses and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportAssessment on the materiality of the ESG topics

In  2019,  we  had  not  only  discussed  the  materiality  of  the  ESG  topics  with  our  stakeholders  through  the  abovementioned 

communication channels but also conducted an online survey to understand the topics that our stakeholders believe to be 

material to the Group’s business. Based on the survey results and our communication with stakeholders, the materiality of the 

ESG topics is evaluated as follows:

Our ESG Direction

Our ESG strategy requires the participation of all of our product lines and platforms, and participation from across the wider 

Internet industry. We will continue to place more emphasis on ESG issues, and encourage every individual, enterprise and 

organisation to take part in the implementation of our ESG strategy.

Our  “Connection” strategy has significant implications for our ESG initiatives. Important changes can be achieved through 

connecting millions of Internet users as well as developing their modes of communication and living and creating more exciting 

opportunities for society. In addition, through the “smart living” system in QQ and Weixin/WeChat, people and public services 

can be digitally connected, which in effect facilitate developments in transport, healthcare, environmental protection, public 

safety and other social arenas. This is important for optimising the distribution of societal resources, driving innovation in public 

services, improving service quality, breaking down communication barriers and ultimately benefiting the wider community. 

We will leverage our core capability in the Internet, technology and communication spheres to develop innovative approaches 

to resolving social issues, promoting social development and protecting the interests of the public. We also aim to drive ESG 

awareness in society, through collaborating with our stakeholders and other industry players.

Going  forward,  we  will  continue  to  enhance  our  corporate  management  system  and  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  our 

operations. We will closely cooperate with our stakeholders with the aim of creating a better future.

Conservation and protection of the environment are at the highest policy level in China. The Law of the People’s Republic of 

China on Energy Conservation requires any entity or individual to meet a mandatory obligation to conserve energy. According 

to Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, all entities and individuals have an obligation to protect 

the  environment,  more  specifically  enterprises  shall  minimise  and  reduce  waste  production  and  impact  to  the  ecology. 

We  recognise  the  importance  of  protecting  the  environment  and  the  conservation  of  natural  resources.  For  example,  our 

Tencent office buildings in Shenzhen have installed a multitude of energy saving technologies and educated our employees 

on how to better save energy. The same is being adopted to offices in other locations worldwide. We also build data centres 

with considerations for the environment. Throughout 2019, Tencent has complied with applicable laws and regulations for 

conserving and protecting our environment.

Energy Saving Measures taken in our Office Building

We have taken environmental protection as one of our priorities when building the new headquarters, Tencent Binhai Tower, 

in Shenzhen. The construction has been certified as meeting the LEED-NC Gold Standard. In 2019, the building’s operation 

was within the LEED-EB operational standard and has complied with LEED-EB standards since its grand opening. In March 

2019, the building officially obtained LEED-EBOM Gold Certification. The property management company of the Shenzhen 

headquarters has obtained ISO 14001 (environmental management) certification, ISO 9001 (quality management) certification 

and GB/T 23331 (energy management system) certification. We have implemented various measures to enhance efficiency of 

energy use and reduce water consumption and emissions.

The air conditioning systems at Tencent Binhai Tower reduce energy consumption by alternating power from hydro-powered 

pumps and electric motors. In 2019, we invested to optimise air conditioning terminal control system and integrated building 

management  system,  and  to  improve  the  matching  of  system  cooling  supply  and  end  cooling  demand  for  the  purpose  of 

energy saving and operational efficiency optimisation. We have further optimised energy savings in the air conditioning and 

building management systems by installing automated energy monitoring devices. Energy consumption from air conditioning is 

further reduced by using natural ventilation during seasons of mild or comfortable weather. Smart lighting was adopted to allow 

remote and automatic control over lighting in all office working areas and transitioned from conventional to an LED lighting 

system for the public areas.

The  office  building  of  Tencent  Binhai  Tower  uses  a  water  reclamation  system  to  reclaim  water  condensation  from  the  air 

conditioning system, and drain water from the water filtration system, employee shower area and server cooling towers. The 

collected  water,  after  being  filtrated  and  purified,  is  reused  for  toilet  flush  water,  irrigating  office  plants  and  cleaning  the 

basement carpark. In addition, we promote a filtrated drinking water system in place of plastic bottled water. This measure 

reduces the waste from plastic packaging materials and indirectly reduces CO2 emissions generated from the vehicles that 
deliver bottled water.

102

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWe  have  adopted  energy  saving  measures  throughout  our  daily  operations.  For  example,  we  have  applied  stricter  on-site 

management of each building property by combining the normal procedures with an energy consumption inspection. When 

people leave the work space, air conditioning, lights and office equipment in the corresponding office areas are required to 

be turned off. We have also set automatic shutoff for unused drinking water dispensing units in work areas to reduce energy 

consumption and eliminate waste.

We monitor the levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitro dioxide 
inside  and  outside  Tencent  Binhai  Tower  with  an  online  monitoring  system  and  display  the  data  on  a  real-time  basis.  To 

monitor air quality in the building, we have installed a smart ventilation system (which regulates the ventilation automatically 

in response to carbon monoxide levels) in the underground parking garage and air ventilation system (which monitors the 

ventilation continuously for carbon dioxide levels) in the office area. We have upgraded the cooking ventilation units in the 

kitchens of our office cafeteria. The cooking ventilation is comprised of fire-resistant environmental exhaust hoods that remove 

oil droplets and filter the cooking ventilation with photolysis purification, activated carbon filtration and air ionisation to remove 

cooking odours. Our filtration of the cooking ventilation is in compliance with the PRC national standards GB18483-2001.

Green Energy Saving Measures taken in our Data Centres

We endeavour to fulfil our responsibility to protect the environment by applying innovative technology to our data centres and 

be the exemplar of green data centres within the PRC.

In terms of site selection for Tencent’s large-scale data centre campus, we sought out geography with low temperature climates 

to help with energy conservation. We also evaluated local availability of renewable and clean energy. Ultimately, we selected 

the  following  three  areas:  the  Guian  New  Area,  rich  in  hydropower  energy,  Zhangjiakou  Huailai,  abundant  in  wind  power 

resources, and Chongqing Water and Soil Hi-tech Eco-City where clean energy is widely used for power.

In terms of green data centres, we have organised environmental impact assessment documents for all self-build data centres, 

and have completed the relevant approvals or filings in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the 

People’s Republic of China.  Shanghai  Qingpu  Data  Centre,  self-built  by  Tencent,  and  Shenzhen  Guangming  Data  Centre, 

custom-built  by  a  contracted  third-party,  which  started  operations  respectively  in  2016  and  2019,  have  been  certified  as 

attaining 5A grade (highest environment rating) for the “Data Centre Green Rating” organised by domestic authorities such as 

the Open Data Center Committee (ODCC), indicating the data centres are domestic leaders in terms of energy conservation 

and  environmental  protection.  In  addition,  in  2019,  Tencent  Tianjin  Data  Centre  was  a  successful  pilot  programme  for 

employing waste heat recovery by redirecting the heat to provide office work area heating in its office building during winter. 

This programme reduced standard coal consumption by approximately 1,600 tons each year.

When  it  comes  to  technologies  employed  by  data  centres,  Tencent’s  fourth-generation  T-block  data  centre  energy  saving 

technologies (comprising (i) photovoltaic + High Voltage Direct Current (“HVDC”) technology for electrical systems; (ii) indirect 

evaporative cooling units; (iii) Tnebula smart control system; and (iv) fully commercialised project delivery solution) have been 

widely used in Tencent’s large data centre campuses in Qingyuan, Yizheng, Chongqing, Guian, etc.

103

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe have adopted the T-base large-scale data centre campus construction model in the construction of data centre campus 

in Qingyuan, Yizheng, Huailai, etc. which has placed us at the leading position in terms of the efficient use of space and the 

standardisation of the construction process. It not only shortens the construction time but also minimises the impact on the 

environment and increases the power usage efficiency (“PUE”) of our data centres.

The annual average PUE of our data centres which are located in low-temperature climate (including the one in Shenzhen) 

is  below  1.25.  The  annual  average  PUE  of  data  centres  within  the  scope  of “Environmental  Performance  Summary”  is 

1.35, a decrease of 0.02 compared with the previous year. We expect that large-scale data centre campus will achieve an 

annual average PUE of 1.20 after the T-base campus is completed and T-block technology is promoted and applied. These 

centres will not only serve as energy efficient data centre for Tencent and our business partners, but will also help to facilitate 

standardised application of the T-block technology in the industry.

In 5G application scenarios, we use intelligent IDC products such as Mini-TB for which we possess independent intellectual 

property rights to meet the needs of edge computing endpoints, improve energy efficiency and promote the development of 

related industries.

We  have  shared  our  experience  and  technology  in  building  green  data  centres  and  relevant  products  with  other  industry 

businesses  so  that  HVDC,  micro  module  and  indirect  evaporative  cooling  technologies  have  been  widely  adopted  in  the 

PRC data centre business. We have also helped establish industry standards for HVDC and micro module technologies in 

order to enhance energy saving efforts among other companies in the industry. In the future, we will further promote T-block 

technology, Mini-TB and smart IDC series products such as the Tnebula smart control system. We will strive to enhance the 

PUE while improving the efficiency of the data centre construction process.

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWORKPLACE

Employee Development and Training

We have a well-established performance management system. A performance assessment for each employee is conducted 

by that employee’s supervisor every six months and employees are required to report to their supervisors a performance target 

after each assessment. Supervisors are encouraged to provide constructive feedback from time to time to assist the personal 

growth of each employee.

Employee talent is our most important asset. We make significant investments in employee  development and training.  We 

encourage employees to attend external and internal trainings. We have adopted relevant policies to ensure that employee 

trainings are available in a user-friendly system. For example, supervisors are required to assist in designing the professional 

development plans for the employees and evaluate the effectiveness of the trainings received by the employees. To ensure 

the quality of the trainings, we have developed policies which set out requirements for the qualifications and experience of the 

instructors and the objectives of the programmes and work with educational institutions to jointly develop training programmes.

In 2007, we founded our own training university, Tencent Academy. It offers different training programmes for each stage of 

an employee’s career, including an induction, on-the-job training and leadership training. It has also set up an online learning 

platform and a mobile learning system in order to allow employees to learn anytime and anywhere. In 2017, one of our training 

programmes won the Excellence in Practice Award by the Association for Talent Development.

As of 31 December 2019, Tencent Academy currently offers over 500 live courses that can be attended in person, 8,800 

online courses and employs over 1,500 in-house part-time instructors. In 2019, we hosted live courses nearly 10,000 times 

and gave over 400 courses over livestream. The average in-house training hours per employee was 33 hours and 98% of 

employees were trained.

We also intend to make available our training resources to business partners and other companies in the industry in order to 

improve employee training standards.

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportCOMMUNITY

Community Investment

We  set  up  the  Tencent  Charity  Foundation  (the  “Tencent  Foundation”)  on  26  June  2007.  It  is  a  non-public  fundraising 

foundation incorporated in the PRC and a separate legal entity. We commit to donating certain portion of our profits to the 

Tencent Foundation every year for the purpose of supporting charitable works. As of 31 December 2019, our Group and our 

employees donated approximately RMB4.3 billion and RMB69 million in total to the Tencent Foundation respectively since 

its establishment. During the year 2019, our Group and our employees donated RMB850 million and RMB1.5 million to the 

Tencent Foundation respectively.

The Tencent Foundation believes that everyone can participate in charity work anytime and anywhere through technology. 

In June 2007, the Tencent Foundation leveraged on our Internet technical capabilities and online platforms to build the first 

online public fundraising platform. It is designed, developed and operated by the Tencent Foundation while we provide server, 

broadband and other technical support for free. The platform is open for eligible charitable organisations free of charge. It 

allows charitable works to be performed more conveniently, smoothly and transparently. As of 31 December 2019, there had 

been over 10,000 active charitable organisations and over 75,000 charity projects in different locations with different focuses.

The Tencent Foundation has also applied technology to various charitable initiatives such as WeCounty for rural development 

and Tencent Three-dimensional Disaster Relief Programme in response to recent natural  disasters in China via  the  online 

platform. In 2019, the total number of donations made by the Internet users was approximately 98.2 million and the total 

amount of the funds raised was about RMB2.787 billion.

The  highlight  of  the  Tencent  Foundation’s  charity  efforts  is  the  annual  “99  Giving  Day”  campaign  where  it  matches  the 

donations made by the Internet users between 7 September and 9 September via its online platform. In 2019, the Tencent 

Foundation donated RMB400 million for the campaign, of which 34.6% was for education initiatives, 33.1% for medical care, 

29.1% for poverty relief, and the remaining 3.2% was for environmental protection initiatives and others.

In addition to promoting philanthropy through the online charity platform, the Tencent Foundation makes direct donation in 

the following areas: (i) supporting technological development in impoverished areas; (ii) rural development; (iii) education; (iv) 

ecological conservation and cultural preservation; (v) community development; and (vi) poverty relief.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, Tencent established a RMB1.5 billion emergency fund to offer resources, technology and 

relief support for combatting the disease. Our charity platform helped raise nearly RMB600 million in donations from over 10 

million concerned Internet users in an effort to support philanthropy institutions nationwide who are helping the fight against 

COVID-19.  We  gathered  factual  COVID-19  news  information  and  posted  to  our  high-traffic  platforms,  such  as  Weixin  and 

Tencent News, to quickly guide people to official news about the virus which resulted in over 600 million page views. Guests 

that sign-in to any of the platforms can check the number of confirmed cases of the virus, locate the nearest clinics for testing 

or seek designated hospitals for urgent medical care.

113

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportIn helping the battle against COVID-19, we help a concerned public stay up to date with the latest news information by working 

closely with the World Health Organization to distribute their official data across the Tencent social and news platforms. We 

also  made  efforts  to  dispel  misleading  COVID-19  rumours  using  our  news  fact-checking  platform  Jiaozhen  (translated  “to 

correct” in Chinese).

We also launched free online consultation to allow access to over 10,000 doctors from our medical care partners, such as 

WeDoctor and DoctorWork. Tencent Medipedia provides verified medical information for over 10,000 diseases. Tencent Health, 

our one-stop portal for online medical services on the Weixin platform has delivered real-time COVID-19 data and information 

to  over  300  million  Weixin  users,  while  also  offering  additional  online  consultation.  During  the  outbreak,  we  launched  AI-

powered tools to enable users to self-diagnose their symptoms using an AI automated response system supplemented with 

medical  AI  imaging.  These  tools  were  also  part  of  a  smart  solution  package  offered  to  assist  40  medical  institutions  with 

providing medical care to persons possibly exposed to COVID-19. We also designed the Tencent Health Code, which helps  

organise the  collection of health information from population groups.  Tracking  population  health information helps reduce 

infection spread and allow healthy persons to make necessary travel to buy necessities. Tencent Cloud provided development 

assistance to create healthcare Mini Programs such as Guangzhou’s “Sui Kang” mini program. This mini program provides 

Guangzhou citizens with official information about COVID-19 and healthcare services that are available. The  program  also 

allowed Guangzhou residents to make reservations to purchase protective face masks. Tencent Cloud is also providing medical 

researchers with access to its supercomputer facility to help the world more quickly find a cure for COVID-19.

We upgraded Tencent Meeting to allow employees and students to work and study more efficiently while staying at home. 

Tencent  Meeting  now  handles  up  to  300  simultaneous  participants  in  a  video  conference.  This  service  is  offered  to  the 

public free of charge to manage the challenges brought on by COVID-19. We also created education tools in cooperation with 

education partners to offer distance learning services. Distance learning enables students to continue studies while at home 

while minimising the spread of infection to an at-risk age group. The distance learning system includes live streaming virtual 

classrooms, online tutoring and a virtual classroom manager for teachers. This virtual classroom ecosystem is being offered 

from Tencent smart education solutions and currently hosted on the Tencent social platforms, Weixin and QQ.

Supporting technological development

In order to encourage younger generations to apply themselves to scientific exploration, the Tencent Foundation initiated the 

Xplorer Prize. The prize targets basic science and cutting-edge technology areas. Eligible candidates for the prize are younger 

scientific and technological workers below the age of 45 who work full-time in Mainland China. In 2019, a total of RMB37.5 

million was granted to the first batch of 50 Chinese young scientific and technological talents. By setting this prize, our aim is 

to help the most gifted young scientific and technological talents to climb the scientific peak.

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportVolunteering

In 2006, some of our employees founded the Tencent Volunteers’ Association at their own initiative. Since then, the Tencent 

Volunteers’ Association has contributed more than 130,000 hours of voluntary services and the total number of participants 

is more than 63,000. There are more than 20 sub-divisions at the city level (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, 

Wuhan,  Guangzhou  and  Hefei)  and  at  the  business  group  level  (such  as  Cloud  &  Smart  Industries  Group,  Technology 

Engineering Group and Interactive Entertainment Group).

Over the last decade, the Tencent Volunteer’s Association has been involved and contributed in the areas of online charity, 

promotion of unhindered Internet access, information technology popularisation, cybersecurity, emergency support, poverty 

relief,  scholarship,  environmental  protection,  care  for  elderly  and  children  with  special  needs  and  animal  protection.  It 

has  launched  more  than  200  volunteering  activities.  In  2016,  it  was  awarded  a  spot  in  the  list  of  Top  10  Best  Volunteer 

Organisations in Guangdong Province.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association combines its expertise in technology to help the community. For example, it has been 

broadcasting information on missing persons via Weixin/WeChat and QQ and with the latest facial recognition and blockchain 

technologies, the number of successful cases increased year by year.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association also established the China IT-Philanthropy Union which promotes the “Internet + Charity” 

model by holding summits and publishing white papers on the successful examples of how the information technology has 

changed the landscape of charity work.

In order to encourage employees to participate in volunteer service, employees, since April 2012, have been granted one day 

of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

Anti-Corruption

According to the Law Against Unfair Competition in the People’s Republic of China, business operators shall not use monies, 

assets  or  other  means  to  bribe  an  entity  or  individuals  to  promote  transaction  opportunities  or  competitive  advantage. 

According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, corruption and bribery may constitute a serious criminal 

offence. We strictly comply with applicable laws and regulations for anti-corruption and embrace the value of integrity, being 

proactive, cooperation and creativity. To promote integrity, we have developed robust systems and measures to detect and 

deter corruption, bribery or any other fraudulent activities. Internal audit is conducted with risk management and risk control to 

ensure the Group’s compliance with ethical standards which we strive to uphold.

116

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportRisk Management and Internal Control Policy

In 2016, we updated the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy (the “Policy”) with a system comprising three lines of 

defence. The first line is business and functional departments. The risk management and internal control departments serve 

as the second line while the internal audit department and anti-fraud investigation department act as the third line of defence. 

The Policy sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in risk management and control (including those 

in relation to  frauds). It is emphasised in the Policy that the management of each business  group  is primarily responsible 

for the risk management and internal controls of its department. If any fraudulent activity is detected, the management of 

the relevant department shall improve the control procedures promptly to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The risk 

management and internal control departments have dedicated a team to each business group to provide internal control and 

risk management support. We also apply continuous auditing to key businesses in order to detect irregularities and identify 

risks in a timely and systematic manner and to improve the effectiveness of fraud risk management and control.

Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct

All employees of the entire Group are required to follow and to strictly comply with the Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct (the 

“Sunshine Code”). It expressly prohibits all kinds of fraudulent activities, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation, extortion, 

falsification  of  information  and  any  other  activities  which  are  not  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  The 

Sunshine Code shall be reviewed annually against the changing needs of the Group and revised when appropriate, in order to 

ensure that it caters for our business development, reflects the positions under applicable laws and regulations and captures 

all kinds of fraudulent activities. In 2019, we have revised the Sunshine Code to include more specific stipulations in relation 

to each category of fraudulent activities so that our employees can understand better our expectations under the Sunshine 

Code. The revised Sunshine Code strengthens the management of bidding behaviours and the tender process and information 

security.  In  terms  of  bidding  behaviours,  the  Sunshine  Code  clarifies  the  definition  and  punishments  of  illegal  behaviours 

including colluding bidding, circumventive bidding, defrauding bidding, etc., and further standardises the company’s bidding 

and tendering projects in accordance with laws and regulations governing the bidding procedure. The goal is to protect the 

legitimate rights and interests of partners and suppliers who fairly participate in the Company’s bidding and tendering projects.

In  2019,  we  published  for  the  first  time  on  our  WeChat  official  account  “Sunshine  Tencent”  information  regarding  the 

Company’s investigation and handling of illegal and criminal cases, including serious duty-related violations such as bribery 

and misappropriation occurring in the first three quarters of 2019. According to the report, all violations discovered have been 

effectively controlled and reported to the government authorities according to the law. These actions demonstrate clearly our 

determination  to  combat  corruption  and  fraudulent  acts.  By  increasing  deterrence  to  committing  white  collar  crimes,  our 

method is not only beneficial to the long-term development of Tencent, but also conducive to building an upright and honest 

environment within the Company and the industry.

117

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy

We have published an anti-fraud and whistleblowing policy (the “Whistleblowing Policy”), which clearly conveys the message 

of zero tolerance in relation to fraudulent activity to all the employees and suppliers/business partners.  All employees and 

suppliers/business partners are encouraged to report genuine concerns about any existing or potentially fraudulent activities 

and  non-compliance.  The  Whistleblowing  Policy  expressly  outlines  the  multiple  whistleblowing  channels,  how  the  Group 

should deal with such concerns and the whistle-blower protection system, so that employees and suppliers/business partners 

can report their good faith concerns without fear of reprisal or potential retaliation. Since 2016, we have maintained an Official 

Account under the name of “Sunshine Tencent” on WeChat to promote our anti-fraud policy and whistleblowing channels with 

a function to allow our business partners to report directly to us.

Fraud Detection and Corruption Prevention

When  a  report  of  suspected  fraudulent  activities  is  received,  the  anti-fraud  investigation  department,  which  consists  of 

professionals  who  used  to  be  part  of  the  anti-corruption  function  at  a  governmental  authority  or  private  enterprise  and 

have  profound  knowledge  in  fraud  risk  management  and  solid  fraud  investigation  experiences,  is  assigned  to  handle  the 

investigation independently. After an investigation has been completed, the employee found and proven to have committed 

such fraud shall be subject to immediate dismissal. At the same time, the department in question must, with the assistance 

of the risk management and internal control departments, take corrective actions in response to the business risk or loophole 

identified during the investigation. If we find any supplier or business partner engaging in corruption or any other fraudulent 

activities, we will terminate the contracts with them immediately. In the event that any fraudulent activity violates any relevant 

laws or regulations, such cases shall be reported to government authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

In order to convey a message regarding our determination to fight against fraud and to introduce our whistleblowing system 

externally, we send a letter to our suppliers and business partners and request them to complete a questionnaire annually. The 

questionnaire sets out our corporate values, the Whistleblowing Policy and the various reporting channels. We will understand 

from each of our suppliers and our business partners whether our employees have requested for any gift, cash or benefit 

during the course of business and whether it has been treated unfairly. Upon receipt of the feedback, we will ensure that 

the questions or concerns raised by our suppliers and our business partners will be addressed promptly. If necessary, the 

anti-fraud investigation department will commence an investigation formally.

Our risk management and internal control departments have established a procurement management control unit to optimise 

the Group’s supplier management system. A new supplier synergy system has been launched for the online management of 

the entire procurement life cycle, from sourcing, selection and onboarding of suppliers, performance assessment to retiring 

suppliers. The system serves as an open platform where the suppliers can provide its corporate information to us and we 

can manage the entire bidding process online. Through a centralised system, the bidding process can be standardised and 

become  more  transparent.  The  supplier  management  system  also  provides  the  suppliers  with  a  communication  channel 

so that we can collect their feedback or complaints. Complaints in relation to fraudulent activities will be passed to the anti- 

fraud investigation department directly for follow-up and those non-fraud related complaints (such as unfair treatment) will be 

handled by the procurement risk management unit. The goal is to ensure that the complaints and concerns of our suppliers 

can be addressed promptly, and the risk of fraud can be minimised.

118

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions

The Group strictly abides by applicable laws and regulations in relation to cross-border and domestic money transmission, 

anti-money laundering (“AML”), counter-terrorist financing (“CTF”), as well as anti-tax evasion in the PRC and other countries 

where  we  provide  payment  processing  services.  Specifically,  according  to  the Anti-Money Laundering Law of the People’s 

Republic of China implemented on 1 January 2007 and the Administrative Measures for Non-financial Institutions Providing 

Payment Services implemented on 1 September 2010, we must formulate AML measures, fulfil AML obligations, and comply 

with relevant AML regulations if we intend to provide users with third-party payment services. The Group is compliant with not 

only its legal obligations but also the expected social responsibilities.

As a result of the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance in multiple jurisdictions, we have established an independent 

AML and sanctions compliance department. The duty of the department is to coordinate the management of money laundering 

and sanctions risk at the Group level for all businesses, to fulfil AML and sanctions requirements under relevant laws and 

regulations, and to manage and promote the implementation of various AML and sanctions initiatives.

In 2019, we have launched a Group-wide Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Programme (the “AML Programme”) which 

focuses  on  putting  in  place  the  most  effective  standards  to  combat  financial  crime.  The  aim  of  the  AML  Programme  is  to 

significantly increase our compliance capabilities and to have in place a set of consistent high standards across our Group 

businesses.

Key aspects of the AML Programme include but are not limited to the followings:

(cid:127) 

Formulating specialised AML and Sanctions units at Group level;

(cid:127) 

Establishing a set of Group minimum standards in AML and Sanctions compliance;

(cid:127) 

Conducting regular independent testing on our AML and Sanctions systems and operational effectiveness; and

(cid:127) 

Developing new methodologies in assessing customer risks to help us better detect and deter financial crime risks.

In  addition,  the  Group  continues  to  dedicate  resources  to  the  AML  Programme  in  the  following  key  areas:  (i)  carrying  out 

on-the-job  and  professional  training  for  our  staff  periodically;  (ii)  ongoing  monitoring  of  and  further  enhancements  to  our 

system infrastructure to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our KYC, transaction monitoring, and suspicious transaction 

reporting processes; (iii) regular review and further strengthening the implementation of our AML and Sanctions systems and 

policies; and (iv) active participation in international AML/CTF events to exchange industry best practices.

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Our  supply  chain  management  programme  attaches  supreme  importance  to  managing  the  ethics  risk  associated  with  the 

relationship between our procurement employees and our business partners. It also focuses on teaching those employees who 

are involved in procurement to recognise and mitigate the inherent risks.

To  enhance  the  social  responsibility  awareness  of  our  employees,  we  have  formulated  a  code  of  conduct  which  those 

employees engaging in procurement activities must adhere to. To minimise the ethics risks, such employees are also required 

to declare any relationship they may have with our suppliers in writing.

In  the  course  of  supplier  engagement,  potential  suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  self-assessment  on  their  commitment, 

amongst other things, to environmental protection, social responsibility, and health and safety at work (the “Self-Assessment”).

Suppliers which are formally engaged by us are also required to agree to the terms of a declaration and undertaking in relation 

to anti-commercial bribery in doing business with our Group (the “Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration”).

During the year ended 31 December 2019, all suppliers which were formally engaged had completed the Self-Assessment and 

signed the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration. We were not aware of any commercial bribery engaged by our suppliers.

The procurement department looks for qualified suppliers in the market and conducts standard or simplified verification on the 

suppliers depending on the duration of the cooperation, the order volume and the nature of the request. We have maintained a 

database of qualified suppliers which are ready to take orders from us.

We  have  an  internal  policy  which  sets  out  the  procedures  for  supplier  onboarding.  Before  engaging  a  supplier,  we  will 

conduct the background check (including site visit) on the supplier. Staff participating in the check include members from 

the procurement department, the requesting department, the technology department (if applicable) and the risk management 

department. The assessment results will be reported to the procurement department for a final determination.

We normally ask for price quotations from at least three vendors. Other factors including delivery time and technical capabilities 

of the vendors will be taken into consideration when selecting vendors. If there is only one vendor available for selection as it 

dominates the relevant market or it is the only vendor with access to the required goods/services, the exclusive procurement 

arrangement  with  such  vendor  will  require  special  approval  with  a  satisfactory  justification  provided  by  the  technology 

department or the requesting department.

We evaluate the performance of our suppliers from time to time and take appropriate steps to address any issues with the 

quality of the suppliers as part of our supply chain management. For suppliers with unsatisfactory performance, subject to 

applicable contractual arrangements, we may (i) discuss with them on the remedial steps to be taken by them; (ii) suspend the 

cooperation; (iii) reduce the order volume; (iv) impose penalties; or (v) suspend payment. The procurement department may 

disqualify a supplier for the following events: (i) we suffer from material economic losses as a result of the delayed delivery, 

quality issue or breach of contract by the supplier; (ii) the supplier has received the lowest rating in the rating scale for two 

consecutive quarters; and (iii) the supplier is in serious breach of business ethics.

before the launch of new products to ensure that our products are not exposed to the risk of privacy infringement or leakage of 

user data.

We provide training to our employees to enhance their privacy protection awareness and build up the cultural awareness of the 

importance of privacy protection.

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportTo  ensure  that  our  users  understand  how  we  protect  their  personal  information  and  enhance  the  transparency  of  how 

we  collect  and  process  the  data,  we  promote  the  concept  of  “Technology  is  deployed  for  social  good  and  data  is  put  in 

manageable use”. We have published the Tencent Privacy Protection Whitepaper and launched the Tencent Privacy Protection 

Platform (https://privacy.qq.com) to give our users a comprehensive understanding of the privacy protection measures taken 

by the Group. We also make our privacy protection policies available on our product websites and in-app products and provide 

communication channels for our users to file complaints and raise enquiries whenever they are in doubt.

The  privacy  policies  of  our  various  applications  have  been  considered  top-ranked  in  the  joint  review  by  the  Cyberspace 

Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, the Ministry of Public Security of 

the PRC and the Standardisation Administration of the PRC and in the review by China Consumers Association among 100 

selected applications. Furthermore, we actively participate in shaping the development of the industry framework on privacy 

protection. For example, our privacy experts are members of the International Association of Privacy Professionals. Many of our 

products have been accredited with privacy certifications from TrustArc. Our network and data security managements have 

been certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

In 2019, we protected millions of devices by monitoring nearly 100 billion lines of code daily and diverting away nearly 10 

billion malicious attack requests in a year. We put together a 400G anti-DDoS protection platform with a maximum protection 

peak of 1.23 Tbps, a top tier system ranking first in the industry. In addition, we add protection by employing thousands of 

top security experts all over the world, publishing threat intelligence, and continually looking for ways to improve its network 

security  ecosystem.  Tencent  sets  a  new  network  security  precedent  with  establishing  its  open  source  security  emergency 

response centre, where open source security features are made available to the entire industry. Open source security features 

have current downloads in the thousands and counting.

In 2019, Weixin platforms produced a total of 17,881 articles to dispel hurtful rumours on the Internet. These articles were 

read over 114 million times. With the mission of “Value for Users, Tech for Good”, the Tencent news fact-checking platform 

created  a database for verifying and confirming facts to  combat the  spread  of  misinformation  on  the Internet. Information 

presently stored in the database cover knowledge in fields such as food safety, nutrition and medical care.

Customer Service

In accordance with Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests promulgated 

on 31 October 1993 and amended on 25 October 2013, when we provide our customers with goods or service, we adhere 

to social morality, operate business in good faith, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers. We also seek 

consumers’ opinions on commodities or services provided to them and accept consumers’ supervision. In accordance with the 

E-commerce Law of the People’s Republic of China, effective on 1 January 2019, we, as an e-commerce business operator, 

have established an accessible and effective mechanism for receiving complaints and abuse reports, publishing of information 

on complaints and abuse reporting methods, prompt handling and resolution for complaints and abuse reports. The Company 

puts  great  importance  on  customer  service,  thus  it  proactively  complies  with  all  relevant  laws  and  regulations  regarding 

customer service.

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportHealthy Environment for our Users

One of our important businesses is our online gaming business. We need to comply with the relevant laws, regulations and 

policy  requirements  in  relation  to  online  gaming  in  the  PRC,  including  the Telecommunication Regulation of the People’s 

Republic of China, the Administrative Regulations on Publishing, the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services 

and the Provisions on the Administration of Online Publishing Services. In accordance with such regulations, when we operate 

value-added telecommunications business, we are required to apply to administrative authorities of information industries to 

obtain a Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operation Permit. When we operate online publishing service for online 

gaming, we must comply by obtaining an Online Publishing Service License.

We have been actively implementing various measures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies. 

For  instance,  we  have  already  obtained  the  relevant  credentials  for  publishing  and  operating  online  games,  such  as  the 

Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operation Permit and the Online Publishing Service License. Meanwhile, in our 

business operation, we are among the first beginners to actively explore into the field of juveniles’ protection.

To safeguard the physical and mental health of online game users and juveniles, we have implemented the real name system 

and  anti-addiction  system  in  accordance  with  the  regulatory  requirements  of  the  PRC  and  strengthened  the  promotion  of 

healthy gaming and anti-addiction through various channels. In February 2017, we launched a series of services on “Tencent 

Guardian Platform” which assist parents to monitor the gaming habits of their underage children. This is the technical platform 

aiming  to  provide  assistance  to  guardian  who  wish  to  help  their  underage  children  to  develop  healthy  gaming  practice  in 

the online game industry. In July 2017, we implemented the Healthy Gameplay System on Honour of Kings, which sends 

reminders to players or forces them to suspend the game if players spend too much time on the game in one day. In 2018, 

we upgraded the Healthy Gameplay System, tightened the requirements for identity verification and made the system available 

for  more  games.  We  also  launched  a  customer  service  which  sends  reminders  when  a  game  player  may  have  engaged 

in  overspending  and  provides  subsequent  counselling.  In  2019,  the  Healthy  Gameplay  System  covered  all  mobile  games 

operated by us in Mainland China.

In  addition,  the  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  has  promulgated  the 

Circular on Prevention of Underage Children’s Addiction to Online Gaming on 25 October 2019 (the “Anti-Addiction Circular”), 

which has regulated underage children’s use of online gaming in many aspects, such as game duration, playing period and 

paymanet service. It also requires that parents, schools and other society members to undertake the responsibility to protect 

underage children. We have been fully implementing the requirements in accordance with the Anti-Addiction Circular after we 

had conducted pilot work on four online games in January 2020.

China has launched a series of laws and regulations regarding protection of intellectual property (“IP”) rights. The Trademark 

Law of the People’s Republic of China last amended on 23 April 2019, the Patent Law of the People’s Republic of China last 

amended on 27 December 2008, the Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China last amended on 26 February 2010 and 

the Implementation Rules for Domain Name Registration with China Internet Network Information Centre last amended on 29 

May 2012 specify rules on the ownership, protection period, registration method and legal responsibility of trademark, patent, 

copyright and domain names. We are a technology-oriented company and we stress the importance of the observation and 

protection of IP rights. We have established a dedicated IP team with approximately 80 employees as of 31 December 2019 

that is responsible for day-to-day management of legal matters involving trademark, patent, copyright, domain names and 

other IP rights.

We began a comprehensive programme for the management of IP at an  early stage. We have consistently applied  for  the 

registration of IP rights since the early stages of its establishment. With the successful development of our business, we have 

expanded our global IP portfolio to cover more than 100 countries and regions. As of 31 December 2019, we had obtained 

over 25,000 officially registered trademarks and over 12,000 issued patents. Coupled with our creation of a vast amount of 

copyrighted  content,  we  have  accumulated  IP  assets  of  considerable  value.  Our  IP  team  has  developed  a  comprehensive 

database for our patents, trademarks and copyrights and our strong data analytical skills enable us to manage and monitor 

our IP rights in a meticulous and efficient manner. To combat infringement of IP rights, our IP team has also established a 

comprehensive and efficient monitoring and maintenance system, and has devised various civil, criminal and administrative 

enforcement measures to protect our IP rights. Please see further details on the Company Website (https://www.tencent.com/

legal/html/en-us/property.html).

We  actively  participate  in  public  affairs  and  strive  to  promote  the  awareness  of  IP  protection  in  the  Internet  industry.  As 

members of the China National Information Technology Standardisation Committee, the China Intellectual Property Society, 

the Patent Protection Association of China, the World Wide Web Consortium, the International Trademark Association and 

the China Trademark Association, we have participated in the consultations on legislative amendments to the PRC laws and 

regulations  relating  to  patents,  trademarks  and  anti-competition  and  have  made  recommendations  in  the  development  of 

industry standards.

Annual Report 2019Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWithin the past decade, we had been awarded the “China Patent Gold Awards” by the State Intellectual Property Office of the 

PRC, the “China Trademark Gold Awards” jointly by World Intellectual Property Organisation and the State Administration for 

Market Regulation and the “China Copyright Gold Awards” by the National Copyright Administration of the PRC and the World 

Intellectual Property Organisation multiple times, signifying our contribution to the development  of  independent innovation 

of  the  PRC.  We  have  also  been  recognised  as  a  “National  Copyright  Demonstration  Unit”  several  times,  demonstrating 

our  outstanding  performance  in  management  and  protection  of  copyright.  The  Company  has  actively  participated  in  the 

development  of  the  standard  patent  issues  in  recent  years.  Particularly,  we  made  certain  contributions  in  the  aspect  of 

standardisation of blockchain electronic invoice.

Looking forward, we will continue to devote great efforts and resources to observe and protect IP rights.

Revenue recognition on provision of online games value-added 

services – estimates of the lifespans of virtual products/items

Refer to Note 2.30(a), 4(a) and 5(b) to the consolidated 

We  discussed  with  management  and  evaluated  their 

financial statements

The Group has recognised revenue from sales of virtual 

products/items to the users in respect of value-added 

services rendered on the Group’s online platforms. The 

relevant  revenue  is  recognised  over  the  lifespans  of 

respective virtual products/items which was determined 

by  the  management,  on  an  item  by  item  basis,  with 

reference  to  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods 

or the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual 

products/items, depending on the terms of the virtual 

products/items.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, a majority 

of the Group’s revenue from value-added services was 

contributed from online games and was predominately 

derived from the sales of virtual products/items.

We focused on this area due to the fact that management 

applied  significant  judgments  in  determining  the 

expected users’ relationship periods for certain virtual 

products/items.  These  judgments  included  (i)  the 

determination  of  key  assumptions  applied  in  the 

judgments  on  key  assumptions  in  determining  the 

estimated  lifespans  of  the  virtual  products/items  that 
were based on the expected users’ relationship periods.

We tested, on a sample basis, key controls in respect 

of  the  recognition  of  revenue  from  sales  of  virtual 
products/items,  including  management’s  review  and 
approval of (i) determination of the estimated lifespans 

of  new  virtual  products/items  prior  to  their  launches; 

and (ii) changes in the estimated lifespans of existing 

virtual products/items based on periodic reassessment 

on  any  indications  triggering  such  changes.  We 
also  assessed  the  data  generated  from  the  Group’s 
information  system  supporting  the  management’s 
review,  including  tested  the  information  system  logic 

for  generation  of  reports,  and  checked,  on  a  sample 

basis, the monthly computation of revenue recognised 

on  selected  virtual  products/items  generated  directly 
from the Group’s information system.

We assessed, on a sample basis, the expected users’ 
relationship periods adopted by management by testing 
the  data  integrity  of  historical  users’  consumption 
patterns  and  calculation  of  the  churn  rates.  We  also 

expected users’ relationship periods, including but not 

evaluated the consideration made by management in 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn 

rates and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy; and (ii) the 

identification of events that may trigger changes in the 

expected users’ relationship periods.

determining the underlying assumptions for expected 
users’ relationship periods with reference to historical 
operating  and  marketing  data  of  the  relevant  games. 

We  also  assessed,  on  a  sample  basis,  the  historical 
accuracy of the management’s estimation process by 
comparing the actual users’ relationship periods for the 
year against the original estimation for selected virtual 

products/items.

We found that the results of our procedures performed 
to  be  materially  consistent  with  management’s 
supporting documentation.

We  tested  management’s  assessment  including 

the consolidated financial statements

As at 31 December 2019, the  Group held significant 

amounts  of  goodwill,  investments  in  associates  and 

joint  ventures  amounting  to  RMB93,456  million, 

RMB213,614  million  and  RMB8,280  million, 

respectively.  Impairment  of  RMB20  million  and

We focused on this area due to the magnitude of the 

carrying  amounts  of  these  assets  and  the  fact  that 

significant judgments were required by management (i) 

to identify whether any impairment indicators existed 

for any of these assets during the year; (ii) to determine 

the  appropriate  impairment  approaches,  i.e.  fair 

assessments, mainly including discounted cash flows 

and  market  approach.  We  assessed,  on  a  sample 

basis, the basis management used to identify separate 

groups of cash generating units that contain goodwill, 

the impairment approaches and the valuation models 
used  in  management’s  impairment  assessments, 

which we found them to be appropriate.

these  key  assumptions  adopted  by  management 

with the involvement of our internal valuation experts 

based  on  our  industry  knowledge  and  independent 

research performed by us. We considered that the key 

assumptions adopted by management are in line with

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportOTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

133

Annual Report 2019Independent Auditor’s ReportAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

(cid:127) 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

(cid:127) 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

(cid:127) 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

(cid:127) 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

(cid:127) 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

(cid:127) 

Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

134

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

Tencent Holdings LimitedConsolidated Statement of Cash FlowsFor the year ended 31 December 20191 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  Value-added  Services  (“VAS”),  FinTech  and  Business  Services  and  Online 

Advertising services.

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interests in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

(cid:127) 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

(cid:127) 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer; and

(cid:127) 

the right to control the management, financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.3(a) and Note 47) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

147

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20191 

GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 47.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or 

loss (“FVPL”), financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”), certain other financial 

liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 

are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

(a)  New and amended standards adopted by the Group

The following standards and amendments have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year beginning on 1 January 2019:

IFRS 16

Leases

IFRS 9 (amendment)

Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

IAS 28 (amendment)

Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures

IAS 19 (amendment)

Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

IFRIC 23

Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

The Group has changed its accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 16 since 1 January 2019. In 

accordance with the transitional provision under IFRS 16, the Group has applied the simplified transition 

approach, and all right-of-use assets were measured at the amount of the lease liabilities on adoption (adjusted 

for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses). Comparative figures for the 2018 financial year have not been 

restated, details of which are disclosed in Note 2.2. Except IFRS 16, the adoption of these new and amended 

standards does not have significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of

As indicated in Note 2.1 above, the Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from 1 January 2019. In 

accordance with the transitional provision under IFRS 16, the Group has applied the simplified transition approach, 

and  all  right-of-use  assets  were  measured  at  the  amount  of  the  lease  liabilities  on  adoption  (adjusted  for  any 

prepaid or accrued lease expenses). Comparative figures for the 2018 financial year have not been restated. The 

new accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2.34.

On  adoption  of  IFRS  16,  the  Group  recognised  lease  liabilities  in  relation  to  leases  which  had  previously  been 

classified  as  “operating  leases”  under  the  principles  of  IAS  17  Leases.  These  liabilities  were  measured  at  the 

present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of 

1 January 2019. The weighted average lessee’s  incremental borrowing  rate applied to the lease liabilities  on  1 

January 2019 was 4.58%.

In  applying  IFRS  16  for  the  first  time,  the  Group  has  used  the  following  practical  expedients  permitted  by  the 

standard:

(cid:127) 

the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

(cid:127) 

the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term within 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as 

short-term leases; and

(cid:127) 

the  exclusion  of  initial  direct  costs  for  the  measurement  of  the  right-of-use  assets  at  the  date  of  initial 

application.

Upon adoption of IFRS 16, principal elements of lease payments and related interest portion have been classified 

within financing activities.

Since the first quarter of 2019, the Group has reclassified interest paid in cash flow presentation from operating 

activities  to  financing  activities,  which  better  reflects  the  nature  of  business.  Comparative  figures  have  been 

reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

2.3  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  where  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 

consideration  arrangement,  which  is  recognised  under  “other  financial  assets”  or  “other  financial 

liabilities”  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and 

contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 

acquisition date.

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.3  Subsidiaries (continued)

(a)  Consolidation (continued)

(i) 

Business combinations (continued)

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as 

equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or financial asset. In 

addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.3  Subsidiaries (continued)

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 47(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.4  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally 

but  not  necessarily  accompanying  a  shareholding  of  between  20%  and  50%  of  the  voting  rights.  Investments 

in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 

Group’s investments in associates include underlying goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated 

impairment loss.

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the 

carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  Where  the  Group’s  share  of  losses  in  an  associate  equals  or  exceeds  its 

interests  in  the  associate,  including  any  other  unsecured  long-term  receivables,  the  Group  does  not  recognise 

further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including investments in associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.5), are impaired. 

If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference  between  the  recoverable 

amount of the investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the 

consolidated income statement.

153

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20192 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.4  Associates (continued)

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

2.5  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. Where the Group’s  share of losses in a  joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in 

the joint venture (which includes any other unsecured long-term receivables that, in substance, form part of the 

Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interests  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.6 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The cost of associates/joint ventures acquired in stages, except for the change from an associate to a joint venture, 

is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interests  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any  additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interests is taken to the consolidated income statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised in prior periods in relation to  the previously held interests  is  also  taken  to  the  consolidated  income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

154

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20192 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.7  Disposal of associates

When the Group loses significant influence over an associate, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A 

gain or loss is recognised at any difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus any proceeds from 

disposing part of the interests in the associate and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity 

method of accounting was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income by an 

associate should be reclassified to the consolidated income statement or transferred to another category of equity 

as specified and permitted by applicable IFRSs when the Group loses significant influence over the associate.

2.8  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.9  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange 

rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried 

at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-

monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss 

are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation 

differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equity instruments classified as FVOCI, are included 

in other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.9  Foreign currency translation (continued)

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income  statement are  translated at  average  exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 

taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.10 Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the reporting period in which they are 

incurred.

156

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20192 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.10 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings

Computer equipment

Furniture and office equipment

Motor vehicles

20 ~ 50 years

2 ~ 5 years

2 ~ 5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease term

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction costs less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.15).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.11 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.12 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease.

2.13 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  represents  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred 

plus acquisition-date fair value of the equity interests previously held by the Group and the non-controlling 

interests in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately under “Other gains/(losses), net” and is not subsequently reversed.

(b)  Media contents

Media contents mainly include game licenses, video and music contents, and literature copyrights. They are 

initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value as acquired through business combinations. 

Media  contents  are  amortised  using  a  straight-line  method  or  an  accelerated  method  which  reflects  the 

estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include trademarks, other copyrights, computer software and technology, non-

compete agreements and land with indefinite useful life. They are initially recognised and measured at cost 

or estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Land with indefinite useful life is not subject to amortisation and impairment reviews are undertaken annually 

or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impact. Other intangible assets 

are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally one to ten years) using the straight-line method 

which  reflects  the  pattern  in  which  the  intangible  asset’s  future  economic  benefits  are  expected  to  be 

consumed.

2.14 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 47(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might 

be impaired. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 

carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 

costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 

which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill 

that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.16 Investments and other financial assets

(a)  Classification and measurement

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

(cid:127) 

those  to  be  measured  subsequently  at  fair  value  (either  through  other  comprehensive  income,  or 

through profit or loss), and

(cid:127) 

those to be measured at amortised cost.

The  classification  depends  on  the  entity’s  business  model  for  managing  the  financial  assets  and  the 

contractual terms of the cash flows.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 

asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 

of  the  financial  asset.  Transaction  costs  of  financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are 

expensed in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their 

cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

Debt instruments

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group’s business model 

for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three categories 

into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

(cid:127) 

Amortised cost: Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash 

flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are classified as and measured at amortised 

cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment measured at amortised cost which is not part of a hedging 

relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income 

from these financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

(cid:127) 

FVOCI:  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  and  for  selling  the 

financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are 

classified  as  and  measured  at  FVOCI.  Movements  in  the  carrying  amount  of  these  financial  assets 

are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the  recognition of impairment losses  or 

reversals,  interest  income  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  which  are  recognised  in  profit  or 

loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in “Other gains/

(losses),  net”  in  the  consolidated  income  statement.  Interest  income  from  these  financial  assets  is 

recognised using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented 

in “finance costs, net” and impairment losses or reversals are presented in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

(cid:127) 

FVPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are classified as and 

measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  debt  investment  measured  at  fair 

value through profit or loss which is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and 

presented in “Other gains/(losses), net” for the period in which it arises.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets 

changes.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 Investments and other financial assets (continued)

(a)  Classification and measurement (continued)

Equity instruments

The Group initially recognises and subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Upon initial 

recognition,  the  Group’s  management  can  elect  to  classify  irrevocably  its  equity  investments  as  financial 

assets at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity instrument under IAS 32 and are not held for trading. 

The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Where  the  Group  has  made  an  irrevocable  election  to  present  fair  value  gains  and  losses  on  equity 

investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and 

losses  to  profit  or  loss  following  the  derecognition  of  the  investments.  Dividends  from  such  investments 

continue to be recognised in profit or loss as “Other gains/(losses), net” when the Group’s right to receive 

payments is established. Equity instruments designated as FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

FVPL  include  financial  assets  designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and 

financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI. Changes in the fair value of FVPL 

are recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

(b) 

Impairment

The  Group  assesses  on  a  forward-looking  basis  the  expected  credit  losses  associated  with  its  debt 

instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether 

there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For accounts receivable and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, 

which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised since initial recognition.

Impairment on deposits and other receivables is  measured  as either 12-month  expected credit losses  or 

lifetime expected credit losses, depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 

since initial recognition. If a significant increase in credit risk of a deposit or receivable has occurred since 

initial recognition, the impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive 

and  as  financial  liabilities  when  the  fair  value  is  negative,  which  are  recognised  under “other  financial  assets” 

and “other financial liabilities” in the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The method of recognising 

the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 

nature of the item being hedged.

The  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  as  hedges  of  a  particular  risk  associated  with  the  cash  flows  of  a 

recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges). The Group documents 

at the inception of the hedging relationship the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 

items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The 

Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the 

inception of each hedge relationship.

A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the hedge effectiveness requirements under 

IFRS 9. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash 

flow  hedges  is  recognised  through  other  comprehensive  income  within  equity,  while  any  ineffective  portion  is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss, within “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in the 

cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the time value of the options that relate to the hedged item 

(‘aligned time value’) are recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity.

Amounts accumulated in equity are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, 

as follows:

(cid:127) 

Where  the  hedged  item  subsequently  results  in  the  recognition  of  a  non-financial  asset,  the  amounts 

accumulated  in  equity  are  removed  from  other  reserves  and  included  within  the  initial  cost  of  the  asset. 

These deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss.

(cid:127) 

For  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  effective  portion  of  the  derivatives  is 

reclassified to profit or loss at the same time when the hedged cash flows affects profit or loss.

When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 

accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remain in equity 

until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 

gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging included in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.18 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and  there  is  an intention  to 

settle on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 

must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in certain 

circumstances, such as default, insolvency, bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

2.19 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily  accounted for  using  the  weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.20 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.21 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly 

liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

The  Group  does  not  recognise  cash  amounts  deposited  with  banks  (which  are  received  under  its  payment 

business) under users’ entrustment in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group holds these 

cash amounts as a custodian according to the relevant users’ agreements.

2.22 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  Group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  instruments,  the  consideration  paid,  including 

any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 

as  treasury  shares  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued, 

any  consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.23 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair  value and subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the 

effective interest method.

2.24 Put option arrangements

Put options are financial instruments granted by the Group which permit the holders to put back to the Group 

their shares in certain subsidiaries for cash or other financial assets (“OFA”) when certain conditions are met. If 

the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or OFA under the put option, a financial 

liability  is  initially  recognised  under “other  financial  liabilities”  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  at  the 

present value of the estimated future cash outflows on exercise under the put option. Subsequently, if the Group 

revises  its  estimates  of  payments,  the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect 

actual and revised estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount based on the present 

value of revised estimated future cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the 

adjustment will be recognised as “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement. In the event 

that the put option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option first becomes exercisable 12 months after the 

end of the reporting period.

2.25 Financial guarantee contracts

The  financial  guarantee  contracts  are  initially  recognised  as  a  financial  liability  at  fair  value  on  the  date  the 

guarantee is given. The liability is subsequently measured at the higher of:

(cid:127) 

the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9; and

(cid:127) 

the  amount  initially  recognised  less,  where  appropriate,  the  cumulative  amount  of  income  recognised  in 

accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows 

between the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required 

without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of the investees are provided for no compensation, the fair 

value is accounted for as contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.26 Borrowings, notes payable and borrowing costs

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their terms using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan facilities to the 

extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 

draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 

down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the term of the facility to 

which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction  of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 

added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 

sale. During the year ended 31 December 2019, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.27 Current and deferred income tax

The income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax, which is recognised in the consolidated 

income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 

in equity. In this case, the income tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20192 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.27 Current and deferred income tax (continued)

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  However, 

deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 

a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable 

profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 

substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax 

asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to 

utilise those temporary differences and tax losses.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the 

Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally, the 

Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only when there is an agreement 

in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, 

deferred tax liability in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from the associate’s undistributed profit is 

not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied 

by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 

settle the balances on a net basis.

2.28 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they are accrued to employees. A provision is 

made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end 

of the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time 

of leave.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.28 Employee benefits (continued)

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate fund. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior years. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants  as  consideration  for  equity  instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of 

the Group. The fair value of the employee services and other qualifying participants’ services received in 

exchange  for  the  grant  of  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  is  recognised  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting 

period, i.e. the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied and credited to 

equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 

the  options  granted  by  using  option-pricing  model, “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the “Binomial 

Model”), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) 

but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award 

shares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s 

shares at the grant date. The Group also adopts valuation techniques to assess the fair value of other equity 

instruments of the Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From the perspective of the Company, the grants of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries are 

made in exchange for their services related to the subsidiaries. Accordingly, the share-based compensation 

expenses are treated as part of the “Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial 

position.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.28 Employee benefits (continued)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (continued)

At each reporting period end, the Group revises the estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 

consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

If  the  Group  repurchases  vested  equity  instruments,  the  payments  made  to  the  employees  and  other 

qualifying  participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the 

payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. 

Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional  expense is  recognised for any  modification  that  increases  the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

Cash-settled share-based payment transactions are those arrangements which the terms provide the Group 

to settle the transaction in cash. Upon the vesting conditions, if any, are met, the Group shall account for 

that transaction as a cash-settled share-based payment transaction if, and to the extent that, the Group has 

incurred a liability to settle in cash.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised 

at the current fair value determined at the end of the reporting period. The Group adopts valuation technique 

to assess the fair value of such equity instruments granted under the share-based compensation plans as 

appropriate.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.29 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.30 Revenue recognition

The Group generates revenues primarily from provision of VAS, FinTech and Business Services, online advertising 

services and other online related services in the PRC. Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods or 

services  is  transferred  to  a  customer.  Depending  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  laws  that  apply  to  the 

contract, control of the goods and services may be transferred over time or at a point in time.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  primarily  include  revenues  from  the  provision  of  online  games  and  social  networks 

services. Online games revenues are mainly derived from sales of in-game virtual items, and social networks 

revenues are mainly derived from sales of virtual products such as VAS subscriptions across various online 

platforms, and games revenues attributable to social networks business. The Group offers virtual products/

items to users on the Group’s online platforms. The VAS fees are paid directly by end users mainly via online 

payment channels.

Revenue from VAS is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services. 

Giving there is an explicit or implicit obligation of the Group to maintain the virtual products/items operated 

on the Group’s platforms and allow users to gain access to them, revenue is recognised over the estimated 

lifespans of the respective virtual products/items. The estimated lifespans of different virtual products/items 

are determined by the management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated 

period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items depending on the respective term of virtual products/

items.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.30 Revenue recognition (continued)

(a)  VAS (continued)

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to 

each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the 

prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

In respect of the Group’s VAS services directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various 

third-party platforms, these third-party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Online Service Fees”) 

on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of platform provider fees (as 

part of “Channel and distribution costs”). Such Channel and distribution costs are withheld and deducted 

from  the  gross  Online  Service  Fees  collected  by  these  platforms  from  the  users,  with  the  net  amounts 

remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Online Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis, given it 

acts as the principal in these transactions based on the assessment according to the criteria stated in (e) 

below, and recognises such Channel and distribution costs as cost of revenues.

The  Group  also  opens  its  online  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  under  certain  co-

operation  agreements,  of  which  the  Group  pays  to  the  third-party  game/application  developers  a  pre-

determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from the users of the Group’s online platforms for 

the  virtual  products/items  purchased.  The  Group  recognises  the  related  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis 

depending on whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. The Group adopts 

different  revenue  recognition  methods  based  on  its  specific  responsibilities/obligations  in  different  VAS 

offerings.

(b)  FinTech and Business Services

FinTech and Business Services revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from provision of FinTech and 

cloud services.

FinTech  service  revenues  mainly  include  commissions  from  payment,  wealth  management  and  other 

FinTech services, which is generally determined as a percentage based on the value of transaction amount 

or  retention  amount.  Revenue  related  to  such  commissions  is  recognised  upon  a  time  when  the  Group 

satisfies its performance obligations by rendering services.

Cloud services are mainly charged on either a subscription or consumption basis. For cloud service contracts 

billed based on a fixed amount for a specified service period, revenue is recognised over the subscribed 

period when the services are delivered to customers. For cloud service provided on a consumption basis, 

revenue  is  recognised  based  on  the  customer  utilisation  of  the  resources.  When  a  cloud-based  service 

includes multiple performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance 

obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, which is determined based on the prices charged to 

or expected to recover from customers.

2.30 Revenue recognition (continued)

(c)  Online Advertising

Online Advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from media advertisements and from social 

and others advertisements, depending on the placement of advertising properties and inventories.

Advertising contracts are signed to establish the prices and advertising services to be provided based on 

different arrangements, including display-based advertising that are display of ads for an agreed period of 

time, and performance-based advertising.

Revenue from display-based advertising are recognised on number of display/impression basis or ratably 

over  the  respective  contractual  term  with  the  advertisers  or  their  advertising  agencies  depending  on  the 

contractual measures. Revenue from performance-based advertising are recognised when relevant specific 

performance measures are fulfilled. Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the Group 

allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, 

which is determined based on the prices charged to or expected to recover from customers.

(d)  Other revenues

The Group’s other revenues are primarily derived from production of and distribution of, films and television 

programmes for third parties, copyrights licensing, merchandise sales and various other activities. The Group 

recognises other revenues when the respective services are rendered, or when the control of the products 

are transferred to customers.

(e)  Principal agent consideration

The  Group  reports  the  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  depending  on  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  a 

principal or an agent in a transaction. The Group is a principal if it controls the specified product or service 

before that product or service is transferred to a customer or it has a right to direct others to provide the 

product or service to the customer on the Group’s behalf. Indicators that the Group is a principal include but 

not limited to whether the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in establishing 

the selling price; (iii) has discretion in supplier selection; (iv) changes the product or performs part of the 

service, and (v) has involvement in the determination of product or service specifications.

(f) 

Contract liabilities and contract costs

A contract liability is the Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group 

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. The Group’s contract 

liabilities mainly comprise of unamortised pre-paid tokens or cards, virtual items, Internet traffic and other 

support to be offered to certain investee companies in the future periods measured at their fair value on the 

inception dates, and customer loyalty incentives offered to the customers (Note 5(c)).

Contract  costs  include  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  costs  to  fulfil  a  contract  with  the 

customers.  The  contract  costs  are  amortised  using  a  method  which  is  consistent  with  the  pattern  of 

recognition of the respective revenues.

(g)  Practical expedients and exemptions

The transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, 

has  not  been  disclosed,  as  substantially  all  of  the  Group’s  contracts  have  a  duration  of  one  year  or  less. 

The unsatisfied performance obligation related to cooperation agreements with certain investees have been 

included in deferred revenue.

2.31 Interest income

Interest  income  is  calculated  by  applying  the  effective  interest  rate  to  the  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial 

asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets 

the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss 

allowance). Interest income is presented as “Interest income” where it is mainly earned from financial assets that 

are held for cash management purposes.

2.32 Dividend income

Dividends  are  received  from  FVPL  and  FVOCI.  Dividends  are  recognised  in  “Other  gains/(losses),  net”  in  the 

consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established. This applies even if they are paid 

out of pre-acquisition profits, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment. 

In this case, the dividend is recognised in other comprehensive income if it relates to an investment measured at 

FVOCI. However, the investment may need to be tested for impairment as a consequence.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.33 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

and expenses which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.34 Leases

As explained in Note 2.2 above, the Group has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Group is the 

lessee. The new policy is described below and the impact of the change in Note 2.2.

The Group leases land use rights (Note 2.12), various buildings, computer equipment and others. Rental contracts 

are typically made for fixed periods of no longer than 10 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis 

and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, 

but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

Prior to 1 January 2019, leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by 

lessors are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received 

from the lessors) are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the 

lease.

Upon  initial  adoption  of  IFRS  16  from  1  January  2019,  a  lease  is  recognised  as  a  right-of-use  asset  and  a 

corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment 

is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period 

so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The 

right-of-use asset is depreciated over the  shorter of  the asset’s  useful life and the lease term on  a straight-line 

basis. A right-of-use asset arising from land lease is presented as “land use rights”.

173

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20192 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.34 Leases (continued)

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include 

the net present value of the following lease payments:

(cid:127) 

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

(cid:127) 

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;

(cid:127) 

amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

(cid:127) 

the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

(cid:127) 

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease.  If  that  rate  cannot  be  readily 

determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, 

being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of 

similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

(cid:127) 

where  possible,  uses  recent  third-party  financing  received  by  the  individual  lessee  as  a  starting  point, 

adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third-party financing was received;

(cid:127) 

uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by 

the Group, which does not have recent third-party financing; and

(cid:127) 

makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 

the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 

each period.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.34 Leases (continued)

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

(cid:127) 

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

(cid:127) 

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

(cid:127) 

any initial direct costs; and

(cid:127) 

restoration costs.

A  right-of-use  asset  is  generally  depreciated  over  the  shorter  of  the  asset’s  useful  life  and  the  lease  term  on  a 

straight-line  basis.  If  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  a  purchase  option,  the  right-of-use  asset  is 

depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. 

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

The Group considers the lease as a single transaction in which the assets and liabilities are integrally linked. There 

is no net temporary difference at inception. Subsequently, the differences arisen on settlement of the liabilities 

and the amortisation of the right-of-use assets, there will be a net temporary difference on which deferred tax is 

recognised.

2.35 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate.

2.36 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk 

and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise 

the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out by the 

senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency  exposures,  primarily  with  respect  to  Hong  Kong  Dollars  (“HKD”),  USD  and  Euro  (“EUR”). 

Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  when  future  commercial  transactions  or  recognised  assets  and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

subsidiaries. The functional currency of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures by using foreign currency forwards.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group entered into foreign currency forward contracts 

in  relation  to  projected  purchases  that  qualify  as  “high  probable”  forecast  transactions  and  hence 

satisfy  the  requirements  for  hedge  accounting.  Under  the  Group’s  policy  the  critical  terms  of  the 

forwards must align with the hedged items.

The Group only designates the spot component of foreign currency forwards in hedge relationships. 

The  spot  component  is  determined  with  reference  to  relevant  spot  market  exchange  rates.  The 

differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as the 

forward points. It is discounted, where material.

The  changes  in  the  forward  element  of  the  foreign  currency  forwards  that  relate  to  hedged  items 

are  deferred  in  the  costs  of  hedging  reserve.  The  effects  of  the  foreign  currency  related  hedging 

instruments are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  the  Group  reported  exchange  gains  of  approximately 

RMB77  million  (2018:  RMB229  million)  within  “Finance  costs,  net”  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement.

As at 31 December 2019, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange 

rates  of  the  above  currencies  against  the  two  major  functional  currencies  would  not  result  in  a 

significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities 

denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency are considered 

to be not significant, given the exchange rate peg between HKD and USD. Accordingly, no sensitivity 

analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(ii)  Price risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  mainly  arising  from  investments  held  by  the  Group  that 

are  classified  either  as  FVPL  (Note  24)  or  FVOCI  (Note  25).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from 

the investments, the Group diversifies its investment portfolio. The investments are  made either for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity analysis is performed by management to assess the exposure of the Group’s financial results 

to equity price risk of FVPL and FVOCI at the end of each reporting period. If prices of the respective 

instruments  held  by  the  Group  had  been  5%  (31  December  2018:  5%)  higher/lower  as  at  31 

December 2019, profit for the year would have been approximately RMB6,611 million higher/lower as 

a result of gains/losses on financial instruments classified as at FVPL (2018: RMB4,794 million), other 

comprehensive income would have been approximately RMB4,018 million higher/lower as a result of 

gains/losses on financial instruments classified as at FVOCI (2018: RMB2,147 million).

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 26, 29 and 31.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 35 and 36, representing a substantial portion 

of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group to cash 

flow interest-rate risk whereas those carried at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate 

risk.

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (continued)

During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts 

to hedge its exposure arising from borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate swap 

contracts, the Group agreed with the counterparties to exchange, at specified interval, the difference 

between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed 

notional amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings 

from  floating  rates  to  fixed  rates  and  were  qualified  for  hedge  accounting.  Details  of  the  Group’s 

outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2019 have been disclosed in Note 38.

The effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group’s financial position and performance are as follows:

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(a)  Market risk (continued)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (continued)

Swaps  currently  in  place  cover  majority  of  the  floating-rate  borrowing  and  notes  payable  principal 

outstanding.

As  at  31  December  2019  and  2018,  management  considered  that  any  reasonable  changes  in  the 

interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to 

cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after 

considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is 

presented for interest rate risk.

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, accounts receivable, other receivables, as well as short-term investments measured at amortised 

cost,  at  FVOCI  and  at  FVPL.  The  carrying  amount  of  each  class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the 

Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

The  majority  of  the  balances  of  accounts  receivable  are  due  from  advertising  customers  and  agencies, 

content production related customers, FinTech and cloud customers and third party platform providers. To 

manage the risk arising from accounts receivable, the Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues 

of credit terms are made to counterparties with an appropriate credit history and the management performs 

ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties. The credit periods granted to these customers are disclosed 

in Note 30 and the credit quality of these customers are assessed, which takes into account their financial 

position, past experience and other factors. The Group has a large number of customers and there is no 

concentration of credit risk.

Other receivables are mainly comprised of loans to investees and investees’ shareholders, rental deposits 

and other receivables. Management makes periodic collective assessments as well as individual assessment 

on the recoverability of other receivables based on historical settlement records and past experience.

180

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20193 

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been 

a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each of the years. To assess whether 

there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares risk of a default occurring on the assets as 

at year end with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. Especially the following indicators are 

incorporated:

(cid:127) 

internal credit rating;

(cid:127) 

external credit rating (as far as available);

(cid:127) 

actual  or  expected  significant  adverse  changes  in  business,  financial  economic  conditions  that  are 

expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;

(cid:127) 

actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty; and

(cid:127) 

significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the counterparty, including changes 

in the payment status of the counterparty.

(i) 

Credit risk of cash and deposits and short-term investments

To  manage  this  risk,  the  Group  only  makes  transactions  with  state-owned  banks  and  financial 

institutions in the PRC and reputable international banks and financial institutions outside of the PRC. 

There has been no recent history of default in relation to these banks and financial institutions. The 

expected credit loss is close to zero.

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 

9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all accounts receivable. In view of 

the sound financial position and collection history of receivables due from these counterparties and 

insignificant  risk  of  default,  to  measure  the  expected  credit  losses,  accounts  receivable  have  been 

grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

181

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20193 

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.1  Financial risk factors (continued)

(b)  Credit risk (continued)

(ii)  Credit risk of accounts receivable (continued)

The  expected  loss  rates  are  based  on  the  payment  profiles  of  revenue  over  12  months  before  31 

December  2019  and  the  corresponding  historical  credit  losses  experienced  within  this  period.  The 

historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic 

factors (such as the GDP of the countries in which it sells its goods and services) affecting the ability of 

the customers to settle the receivables.

A default on accounts receivable is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 

90 days of when they fall due. Accounts receivable are written off, in whole or in part, when it has 

exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of 

recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the 

failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan within the Group, and a failure to make contractual 

payments for a period of greater than 3 years past due.

Impairment losses on accounts receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating 

profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same item.

(iii)  Credit risk of other receivables

Management considers the credit risk of other receivables is insignificant when they have a low risk of 

default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near 

term, and the loss allowance recognised is therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. In view 

of insignificant risk of default and credit risk since initial recognition, management believes that the 

expected credit loss under the 12 months expected losses method is immaterial.

(c) 

Liquidity risk

The Group aims to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and readily marketable securities, which 

are  classified  as  FVPL.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  underlying  businesses,  the  Group  maintains 

flexibility in funding by maintaining adequate balances of such.

The  table  below  analyses  the  Group’s  financial  liabilities  by  relevant  maturity  groupings  based  on  the 

remaining period since the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date (or the earliest date a 

financial liability may become payable in the absence of a fixed maturity date). The amounts disclosed in the 

table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital  refers  to  equity  and  external  debts  (including  borrowings  and  notes  payable).  In  order  to  maintain  or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The  Group  monitors  capital  by  regularly  reviewing  debts  to  adjusted  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation 

and amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflects 

financial health and liquidity position. The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts 

by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Borrowings (Note 35)

Notes payable (Note 36)

Total debts

Adjusted EBITDA (Note)

Total debts/Adjusted EBITDA ratio

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2019 by level of 

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

(cid:127) 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

(cid:127) 

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

(cid:127) 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined  with  reference  to  quoted  market 

prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly 

available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices 

represent  actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  on  an  arm’s  length  basis.  These  instruments  are 

included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include:

(cid:127) 

(cid:127) 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

(cid:127) 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, there was 1 transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value 

measurements.  For  transfers  in  and  out  of  level  3  measurements  see  the  following  table,  which  presents  the

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

Note:

Valuation processes inputs and relationships to fair value (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who performs valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. The 

team performs valuation, or necessary updates, at least once every quarter, which coincides with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  team  adopts  various  valuation  techniques  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  Group’s  level  3 

instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and consulted when it is necessary.

The  components  of  the  level  3  instruments  mainly  include  investments  in  unlisted  companies  classified  as  FVPL  or  FVOCI, 

and  other  financial  liabilities.  Other  financial  liabilities  mainly  include  contingent  consideration  payable  related  to  business 

combination of the Group. As these investments and instruments are not traded in an active market, majority of their fair values 

have  been  determined  using  applicable  valuation  techniques  including  comparable  transactions  approach  and  other  option 

pricing approach. These valuation approaches require significant judgment, assumptions and inputs, including risk-free rates, 

expected volatility, relevant underlying financial projections, and market information of recent transactions (such as recent fund 

raising transactions undertaken by the investees) and other exposure, etc.

The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value 

measurements of investments in unlisted companies.

3.3  Fair value estimation (continued)

Note: (continued)

For the fair value of the Group’s investments in unlisted companies, the sensitivity analysis is performed by management, see 

Note 3.1(a)(ii) for details.

For the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combination, if growth rate of net profit had been 5% higher 

or lower as at 31 December 2019, the fair value would have increased approximately RMB65 million (2018: RMB150 million) 

or decreased approximately RMB66 million (2018: RMB171 million). If the expected volatility had been 5% higher or lower as 

at 31 December 2019, the fair value would have decreased approximately RMB34 million (2018: RMB90 million) or increased 

approximately RMB25 million (2018: RMB92 million).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual products/items provided on the Group’s online platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.30(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  on  the  Group’s 

online platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the estimated lifespans of the virtual products/

items. The estimated lifespans of different virtual products/items are determined by the management based on 

either the expected users’ relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/

items depending on the respective terms of virtual products/items.

Significant  judgments  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  including  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespans 

of  virtual  products/items  on  a  regular  basis  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of  change  in  the  expected  users’ 

relationship periods.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespans of the virtual products/items. The results may differ from 

the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different 

basis from that in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (continued)

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, right-of-use assets, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed 

for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be 

recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-use calculations or fair value less 

costs to sell. These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgment  is  required  to  identify  any  impairment  indicators  existing  for  any  of  the  Group’s  goodwill,  other  non-

financial assets to determine appropriate impairment approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value 

in use, for impairment review purposes, and to select key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, 

including  discounted  cash  flows  and  market  approach.  Changing  the  assumptions  selected  by  management 

in assessing impairment could materially affect the result of the impairment test and in turn affect the Group’s 

financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  If  there  is  a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  key  assumptions 

applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment charge to the consolidated income statement.

(c)  Fair value measurement of FVPL, FVOCI and other financial liabilities

The fair value assessment of FVPL, FVOCI and other  financial liabilities that are  measured  at level  3 fair  value 

hierarchy  requires  significant  estimates,  which  include  risk-free  rates,  expected  volatility,  relevant  underlying 

financial  projections,  market  information  of  recent  transactions  (such  as  recent  fund  raising  transactions 

undertaken  by  the  investees)  and  other  assumptions.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could 

materially affect the respective fair value of these investments.

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.28(c),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants.  The  directors  have  adopted  the  Binomial  Model  to  determine  the  total  fair  value  of  the  options 

granted, which is to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant judgment on parameters, such 

as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the 

Binomial Model (Note 34).

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Binomial Model was approximately HKD3,250 million (equivalent to approximately  RMB2,785 million) in  2019 

(2018: HKD3,533 million (equivalent to approximately RMB2,868 million)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2019, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

95%-97% (31 December 2018: 88%-97%).

(e) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the 

worldwide provision for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax in the period 

in which such determination is made.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUES

(a)  Description of segments and principal activities

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s 

internal reporting in order to assess performance, allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based 

on these reports.

In view of the increased scale and business importance of payments, financial and enterprise-facing activities, 

and to help investors better understand the Group’s revenue structure and margin trends, a new segment named 

“FinTech  and  Business  Services”  has  been  separated  from  “Others”  segment  from  the  first  quarter  of  2019 

onwards,  both  in  the  internal  reports  to  the  chief  operating  decision  makers  and  in  the  consolidated  financial 

statements of the Group. The new “FinTech and Business Services” segment primarily consists of: (a) payment, 

wealth  management  and  other  FinTech  services;  and  (b)  cloud  services  and  other  enterprise-facing  activities 

such as our Smart Retail initiative. The comparative figures in the consolidated income statement and the note 

have been restated to conform with the new presentation. The Board believes that the above changes in segment 

information better reflect current market trends, as well as resource allocation and future business development of 

the Group.

The Group has the following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018:

– 

VAS;

– 

FinTech and Business Services;

– 

Online Advertising; and

– 

Others.

Subsequent  to  the  change,  the  “Others”  business  segment  now  consists  of  the  financials  of  investment  in, 

production  of  and  distribution  of,  films  and  television  programmes  for  third  parties,  copyrights  licensing, 

merchandise sales and various other activities.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUES (continued)

(a)  Description of segments and principal activities (continued)

The chief operating decision-makers assess the performance of the operating segments mainly based on segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore, they 

are  not  included  in  the  measure  of  the  segments’  performance  which  is  used  by  the  chief  operating  decision-

makers  as  a  basis  for  the  purpose  of  resource  allocation  and  assessment  of  segment  performance.  Interest 

income, other gains/(losses), net, finance income/(costs), net, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures 

and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. The revenues 

from external customers reported to the chief operating decision-makers are measured in a manner consistent with 

that applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other  information,  together  with  the  segment  information,  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers,  is 

measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that  applied  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  were  no 

segment assets and segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

The segment information provided to the chief operating decision-makers for the reportable segments for the years 

ended 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Income tax expense (continued)

(iii)  PRC CIT

PRC  CIT  has  been  provided  for  at  applicable  tax  rates  under  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  after 

considering  the  available  preferential  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and  allowances,  and  on  the  estimated 

assessable profit of entities within the Group established in Mainland China for the years ended 31 December 

2019 and 2018. The general PRC CIT rate is 25% in 2019 and 2018.

Certain subsidiaries of the Group in Mainland China were approved as High and New Technology Enterprise, 

and accordingly, they were subject to a preferential corporate income tax rate of 15% for the years ended 

31 December 2019 and 2018. Moreover, according to the announcement and circular issued by relevant 

government authorities, certain subsidiaries that qualified as national key software enterprises were subject 

to a preferential corporate income tax rate of 10%.

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by Mainland China tax authorities, certain subsidiaries 

of  the  Company  are  entitled  to  other  tax  concessions,  mainly  including  the  preferential  policy  of  “2-year 

exemption  and  3-year  half  rate  concession”  and  the  preferential  tax  rate  of  15%  applicable  for  some 

subsidiaries  located  in  certain  areas  of  Mainland  China  upon  fulfillment  of  certain  requirements  of  the 

respective local governments.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other jurisdictions

Income tax on profits arising from  other jurisdictions, including the United  States,  Europe, East Asia  and 

South America, has been calculated on the estimated assessable profit for the year at the respective rates 

prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions, ranging from 12.5% to 35%.

(v)  Withholding tax

According to applicable tax regulations prevailing in the PRC, dividends distributed by a company established 

in  Mainland  China  to  a  foreign  investor  with  respect  to  profit  derived  after  1  January  2008  are  generally 

subject  to  a  10%  withholding  tax.  If  a  foreign  investor  is  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong,  under  the  double

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption of 

the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted by 

the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS).

In  addition,  the  profit  attributable  to  equity  holders  (numerator)  has  been  adjusted  by  the  effect  of  the  share 

options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and associates, excluding 

those which have anti-dilutive effect to the Group’s diluted EPS.

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018 are listed 

below:

Pension insurance

Some computer equipment contain variable lease payments. Variable payments are used for a variety of reasons, 

including managing cash outflows and minimising the fixed costs. Variable lease payments that depend on usage 

of bandwidth are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments 

occur. Variable lease payments relating to computer equipment leases during the year ended 31 December 2019 

were considered to be insignificant.

Note:

To better help investors understand the composition of the Group’s intangible assets, trademarks are presented as a separate category instead of being 

grouped under  “Others”, while game licenses, video and music contents, copyrights and other online contents are brought together under the  “Media 

contents” category. The comparative figures have been restated to conform with the new presentation.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, amortisation of RMB27,802 million (2018: RMB24,698 million) and RMB1,152 million 

(2018: RMB918 million) were charged to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses, respectively.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)

During the year ended 31 December 2019, impairment losses of RMB183 million (2018: RMB1,181 million) on goodwill 

and other intangible assets were charged to the consolidated income statement under “Other gains/(losses), net”, and 

RMB51 million (2018:Nil) were charged to “cost of revenues” resulting from revisions of financial/business outlook and 

changes in the market environment for the underlying business.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill was allocated to VAS segment with RMB86,489 million (31 December 2018: RMB25,672 million), FinTech 

and  Business  Services  segment  with  RMB34  million  (31  December  2018:  Nil)  and  Others  segment  with  RMB6,933 

million (31 December 2018: RMB6,933 million). The Group carries out its impairment testing on goodwill by comparing 

the recoverable amounts of CGUs or groups of CGUs to their carrying amounts. For the purpose of goodwill impairment 

review, the recoverable amount of a CGU (or groups of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its 

value in use.

The  key  assumptions  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  recoverable  amounts  of  the  CGUs  (or  groups  of  CGUs)  under 

impairment testing were as follows:

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s businesses in online music, online literature, television series and film production, 

value in use using discounted cash flows was calculated, in most cases, based on five-year period to ten-year period 

financial projections plus a terminal value related to cash flows beyond the projection period extrapolated at an estimated 

terminal growth rate of generally not more than 5% (2018: not more than 5%). Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 13% 

to 25% (2018: 15% to 25%) were adopted, which reflected assessment of time value and specific risks relating to the 

industries that the Group operates in. Management leveraged their experiences in the industries and provided forecast 

based on past performance and their anticipation of future business and market developments. Key parameters applied 

in the financial projections for impairment review purpose also included revenue growth rates, on a compound annual 

basis, of not more than 18% (2018: not more than 27%).

For goodwill attributable to the Group’s online game business within VAS segment, fair value less costs of disposal was 

determined based on ratios of EV (enterprise value) divided by EBITDA of several comparable public companies (range: 

10-25x) (2018: range: 11-21x) multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU (or group of CGUs) and discounted for lack 

of marketability at a range of 10% to 20% (2018: 10% to 20%). The comparable public companies were chosen based 

on factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and financial risks.

As at 31 December 2019, management has not identified reasonably possible change in key assumptions that could 

cause carrying amounts of the CGU’s (or groups of CGUs’) to exceed the recoverable amount.

(a) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  the  Group  acquired  certain  new  associates  and  made  additional  investments  in

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)

Note: (continued)

(b) 

During the year ended 31 December 2019, transfers mainly comprised the following:

(i) 

investment in an associate of approximately RMB17,735 million, which held majority interests in a mobile game developer, 

was transferred to investment in a subsidiary (Note 41(a));

(ii) 

associates  achieved  in  stages  of  an  aggregate  amount  of  approximately  RMB6,127  million,  which  mainly  included 

approximately RMB3,202 million transferred from FVPL due to the conversion of redeemable instruments or preferred 

shares into ordinary shares upon their IPOs, and approximately RMB2,874 million transferred from financial instruments 

due to acquiring board representatives or converting the convertible promissory note; and

(iii) 

associates  of  an  aggregate  amount  of  approximately  RMB6,029  million  were  transferred  to  FVPL  and  approximately 

RMB1,311 million were transferred to FVOCI as a result of changes in nature of these investments.

(c) 

During the year ended 31 December 2019, a company listed in the PRC completed a substantial assets reorganisation pursuant 

to  which  it  acquired  the  entire  equity  interest  of  an  associate  of  the  Group  through  a  share  swap.  Upon  completion  of  the 

aforesaid reorganisation, the Group’s equity interest in that associate was exchanged for approximately 5% of the issued ordinary 

shares of the listed company valued at approximately RMB3,526 million. Since the Group has no board representative in the 

listed company and this investment is not held for trading, this investment was recognised as FVOCI.

(d) 

Both external and internal sources of information of associates are considered in assessing whether there is any indication that 

the investment may be impaired, including but not limited to financial position, business performance and market capitalisation. 

The Group carries out impairment assessment on those investments with impairment indications, and the respective recoverable 

amounts of investments are determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

In  respect  of  the  recoverable  amount  using  value  in  use,  the  discounted  cash  flows  calculations  were  based  on  cash  flow 

projections estimated by management and the key assumptions adopted in these cash flow projections include revenue growth 

rate, profit margins and discount rate. The pre-tax discount rates adopted range from 15% to 20%. In respect of the recoverable 

amount based on fair value less costs of disposal, except for those listed associates using their respective market prices, the 

fair value less costs of disposal was calculated using certain key valuation assumptions including the selection of comparable 

companies, recent market transactions and liquidity discount for lack of marketability.

As a result, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB3,877 million (2018: RMB14,069 million) against the 

carrying amounts of certain investments in associates during the year ended 31 December 2019, which includes impairment loss 

of approximately RMB5,427 million recognised and approximately RMB1,550 million reversed. The impairment losses mainly 

resulted from revisions of financial/business outlook of the associates and changes in the market environment of the underlying 

business.

The associates of the Group have been accounted for by using equity method based on the financial information of the 

associates prepared under the accounting policies generally consistent with the Group.

Management  has  assessed  the  level  of  influence  that  the  Group  exercises  on  certain  associates  with  the  respective 

shareholding below 20% and an associate with shareholding over 50% (voting power is below 50%), with total carrying 

amounts of RMB145,971 million and RMB13,393 million as at 31 December 2019, respectively (31 December 2018: 

RMB149,175 million and RMB24,948 million, respectively). Management determined that it has significant influence 

thereon through the board representation or other arrangements made, and it has no control or joint control over such 

investees as the Group has no power to direct relevant activities due to other arrangements made. Consequently, these 

investments have been classified as associates.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group disposed of certain investments with an aggregate amount of RMB16,664 

million, which are mainly engaged in the provision of Internet-related services.

significant influence, these investments have been classified as FVPL.

Beginning  from  1  January  2018,  the  Group  applies  the  simplified  approach  permitted  by  IFRS  9,  which  requires 

expected  lifetime  losses  to  be  recognised  from  initial  recognition  of  the  assets.  The  provision  matrix  is  determined 

based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivables with similar credit risk characteristics 

and  is  adjusted  for  forward-looking  estimates.  The  historical  observed  default  rates  are  updated  and  changes  in  the 

forward-looking estimates are analysed at year end. For the year ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, information about 

the impairment of accounts receivable and the Group’s exposure to credit risk and foreign currency risk can be found in 

Note 3.1.

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 201933  OTHER RESERVES (continued)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with  limited  liabilities  in  the  PRC,  appropriation  of  net  profit  (after  offsetting  accumulated  losses  from  prior  years)  should  be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profit (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 34(d)).

(d) 

The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity instruments in other comprehensive 

income.  These  changes  are  accumulated  with  FVOCI  reserve  with  equity.  The  Group  transfers  amounts  from  this  reserve  to 

retained earnings when the relevant equity instruments are derecognised.

238

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 201934  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted five share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II, the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme II and the Post-IPO 

Option Scheme III expired on 31 December 2011, 23 March 2014, 16 May 2017 and 13 May 2019, respectively. 

Upon the expiry of these schemes, no further options would be granted under these schemes, but the options 

granted prior to such expiry continued to be valid and exercisable in accordance with provisions of the schemes. 

As  at  31  December  2019,  there  were  no  outstanding  options  exercisable  of  the  Pre-IPO  Option  Scheme,  the 

Post-IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme III.

In respect of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV which continues to be in force, the Board may, at its discretion, grant 

options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms and conditions 

stipulated therein. The exercise price must  be  in  compliance with  the  requirement under  the  Rules Governing 

the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange. In addition, the option vesting period is determined by the Board 

provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year period for the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV after the date of 

grant of option.

(i)  Movements in share options (continued)

During the year ended 31 December 2019, 3,506,580 options were granted to an executive director of the 

Company (2018: 3,215,800 options were granted to an executive director of the Company).

As a result of the options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2019, 1,612,741 ordinary shares 

(2018: 6,891,249 ordinary shares) were issued by the Company (Note 32). The weighted average price of 

the shares at the time these options were exercised was HKD339.07 per share (equivalent to approximately 

RMB301.04 per share) (2018: HKD399.37 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB325.67 per share)).

(ii)  Outstanding share options

The outstanding share options as of 31 December 2019 were divided into one to five tranches on an equal 

basis as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised after a specified period ranging from ten 

months to five years from the grant date, and then the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each 

subsequent year.

34  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)

(a)  Share option schemes (continued)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Binomial Model to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2019 was HKD123.82 per share (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB106.09  per  share)  (2018:  HKD127.43  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately 

RMB103.46 per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend  yield  and  expected  volatility,  are  required  to  be  made  by  the  directors  in  applying  the  Binomial 

Model, which are summarised as below.

The expected volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is determined based on the 

average daily trading price volatility of the shares of the Company.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted three share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”) as of 31 December 2019, 

which are administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group. The vesting period of the awarded 

shares is determined by the Board.

Movements in the number of awarded shares for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  59,484  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  five  independent 

non-executive  directors  of  the  Company  (2018:  39,500  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent 

non-executive directors of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2019  was 

HKD360.25 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB313.18 per share) (2018: HKD374.32 per share (equivalent 

to approximately RMB316.30 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2019 were divided into one to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from four 

months to five years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

243

Annual Report 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 201934  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)

(c)  Employee investment schemes

To align the interests of key employees with the Group, the Group established six employees’ investment plans 

in  the  form  of  limited  liability  partnerships  in  2011,  2014,  2015,  2016  and  2017  (the “EIS”)  respectively.  The 

EIS in 2011 was terminated in 2019. According to the term of the EISs, the Board may, at its absolute discretion, 

invite any qualifying participants of the Group, excluding any director of the Company, to participate in the EISs by 

subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. The participating employees are entitled to all the 

economic benefits generated by the EISs, if any, after a specified vesting period under the respective EISs, ranging 

from  four  to  seven  years.  Wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  acting  as  general  partner  of  these  EISs 

administer and in essence, control the EISs. These EISs are therefore consolidated by the Company as structured 

entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018 were 

insignificant to the Group.

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the respective board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion. 

The  share  options  or  restricted  shares  of  the  subsidiaries  granted  are  normally  vested  by  several  tranches. 

Participants of some subsidiaries have the right to request the Group to repurchase their vested equity interests 

of  the  respective  subsidiaries  (“Repurchase  Transaction”).  The  Group  has  discretion  to  settle  the  Repurchase 

Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Company or by cash. For the Repurchase Transaction which 

the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company are currently of the view that some of them would 

be  settled  by  equity  instruments  of  the  Company.  As  a  result,  they  are  accounted  for  using  the  equity-settled 

share-based payment method. In addition, Halti S.A. (“Halti”), the parent company of Supercell Oy (“Supercell”), 

provides a put arrangement to the participants of the share-based compensation plans operated by Supercell for 

cash, the share-based compensation plans of Supercell are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment 

transactions in the consolidated financial statement.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December  2019,  the  Expected  Retention  Rate  of  the  Group’s  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  was  assessed  to  be 

95%~97% (31 December 2018: 88%~97%).

(a)  The acquisition of additional equity voting interest in an associate holding a majority interest in Supercell

On  21  October  2019  (the  “Acquisition  Date”),  the  Group  acquired  additional  44,000  ordinary  voting  shares  in 

an associate, Halti, by converting the entire principal outstanding and relevant interest under the USD40 million 

convertible  bond  issued  by  Halti  into  ordinary  voting  shares  (“Conversion”)  when  it  became  exercisable.  As  at 

the  Acquisition  Date,  Halti  held  a  majority  interest  in  and  controlled  a  mobile  game  developer  Supercell.  After 

the  Conversion,  the  Group  increased  its  equity  voting  interest  in  Halti  from  50%  to  51.2%,  and  considered  it 

has sufficient power to control Halti. As a result, Halti was accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group upon the 

Conversion (“Step-up Acquisition”). The equity interest held under investment in an associate was re-measured to 

fair value and a remeasurement gain of approximately RMB1,550 million was recognised in profit or loss.

Goodwill  of  approximately  RMB59,406  million  was  recognised  as  a  result  of  the  Step-up  Acquisition.  It  was 

mainly attributable to the operating synergies and economies of scale expected to be derived from combining the 

operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purpose. The Group chose to record 

the non-controlling equity interests in Halti at fair value on Acquisition Date.

41  BUSINESS COMBINATION (continued)

(a)  The acquisition of additional equity voting interest in an associate holding a majority interest in Supercell 

(continued)

Note:

Prior to the Step-up Acquisition, Halti has granted put option to non-controlling shareholders of Supercell, and the non-controlling 

shareholders shall have the right to request Halti to purchase their vested shares at a pre-determined schedule. The put price 

was determined based on the financial performance of Supercell and a pre-determined formula that was set out in the respective 

shareholders’ agreements. Accordingly, the put liability of approximately RMB7,452 million (Note 38) which was measured at the 

present value of the estimated future cash outflows was recognised upon the completion of Step-up Acquisition. The put liability 

was subsequently measured at amortised cost.

The Group’s revenue for the year would be increased by not more than 5% and the results for the year would not be materially 

different should the Step-up Acquisition otherwise occur on 1 January 2019.

The related transaction costs of the Step-up Acquisition are not material to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(b)  Other business combinations

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  the  Group  also  acquired  certain  insignificant  subsidiaries.  The 

aggregate  considerations  for  these  acquisitions  was  approximately  RMB1,280  million,  fair  value  of  net  assets 

acquired  (including  identifiable  intangible  assets),  non-controlling  interests  and  goodwill  recognised  were 

approximately RMB389 million, RMB29 million and RMB920 million, respectively.

The revenue and the results contributed by these acquired subsidiaries for the period since respective acquisition 

date were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different 

if these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2019.

The  related  transaction  costs  of  these  business  combinations  were  not  material  to  the  Group’s  consolidated 

financial statements.

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non-wholly owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(c) 

All subsidiaries’ undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary’s undertakings 

held directly by the parent company does not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company further does 

not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As at 31 December 2019, cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB121.98 

billion were held in Mainland China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and treasury regulations. 

The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment of dividends, share 

repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 34(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 34(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Ad ministering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes which 

are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2019,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB1,186  million  (2018:  RMB2,187 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
