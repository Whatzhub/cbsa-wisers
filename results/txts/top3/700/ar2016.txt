Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

1. 

Internet Industry Trends

In  2015,  the  Internet  further  penetrated  everyday  life,  providing  users  with  new  value  and  additional  convenience. 

Messaging and social networking continued to rank as the highest time spent and widest penetration activities on smart 

phones, and evolved into increasingly relevant content discovery media. Search queries moved primarily to mobile, and 

search remained an important content discovery tool, along with application stores. Online shopping became increasingly 

widespread, especially in lower-tier cities, and eCommerce transaction volumes sustained healthy growth rates. Online 

advertising activity shifted decisively from PC to mobile, with particular growth in areas such as performance advertising 

on  social  networks,  pre-roll  advertising  in  video  services,  and  in-feed  advertising  in  news  services.  Users  proved 

increasingly willing to pay for digital content such as movies, TV series, and music. Mid/Hard-core smart phone games, 

including PC game franchises moving to smart phones, boosted game industry revenue.

China Internet companies in sectors such as ride-hailing, classified listings, group-buying, and online travel services 

competed  with  heightened  intensity  in  2015,  leading  to  rapid  user  growth  but  reduced  or  negative  profitability. 

Consequently, several leading companies in these sectors consolidated with competitors, creating a wave of merger and 

acquisition activities. Offline-to-Online transaction volumes increased, which, together with the emergence of person-to-

person payment transactions, contributed to substantial growth in online payment volumes.

2. 

Company Strategic Highlights

In 2015, we conducted a series of initiatives to enhance our ongoing businesses in China:

—  Social platforms:  we  sustained  user  growth  of  Mobile  QQ  year-on-year,  particularly  among  young  users,  via 

promoting  entertainment-driven  and  community-based  activities,  while  expanding  the  user  base  of  Weixin,  via 

connecting a diversified product and service portfolio to a broad range of users. Our performance-based social 

advertising revenues more than doubled year-on-year.

—  Online games: we reinforced our leadership in the smart phone game market via introducing new titles based on 

proven IP, adding new game genres, leveraging our PC client game operational expertise, and developing player 

communities.

—  Media & content: we sustained traffic leadership in multiple online media categories, such as video, sports, music, 

news and literature, via partnering with premium content providers, such as the NBA, HBO, Paramount, Warner 

Music, and Sony Music, and investing in original content. We grew our digital content subscription services via 

leveraging our social platforms and optimizing our premium business models.

5

Annual Report 2015Chairman’s StatementDuring  the  year,  we  further  executed  our  “Connection”  strategy,  bringing  our  own  and  our  partners’  products  and 

services  to  our  consumers  via  cultivating  an  ecosystem  around  our  core  communication  and  social  platforms.  Key 

initiatives for our “Internet-Plus” ecosystem included:

— 

Enriching products and services available within our platforms. For example, we introduced personal micro-loan 

products and municipal services, such as visa applications, to Mobile QQ and Weixin.

— 

Promoting  our  online  payment  services  through  enriched  payment  scenarios,  increasing  MAU  of  our  mobile 

payment services by over 7 times year-on-year.

—  Growing our mobile utility services, including security, browser and application store, strengthening infrastructural 

supports to our mobile ecosystem.

— 

Investing in equity stakes in leading companies in related Internet verticals, such as Internet Plus Holdings, to 

provide best-in-class services to our users.

— 

For  QQ,  smart  device  MAU  increased  by  11%  year-on-year  to  642  million  at  the  end  of  2015,  while  overall 

PCU  increased  by  11%  year-on-year  to  241  million.  QQ  Group  user  engagement  benefited  from  a  revenue-

sharing scheme introduced to incentivize group creators. Our QQ Wallet payment service gained popularity with 

approximately 6 billion red envelopes exchanged via QQ Wallet within six days during the Lunar New Year holidays 

in early 2016.

6

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s Statement— 

For  Qzone,  smart  device  MAU  increased  by  6%  year-on-year  to  573  million  at  the  end  of  2015.  User  activity 

benefited from enhanced features in areas such as sticker sharing and photo album editing.

— 

For Weixin and WeChat together, MAU reached 697 million at the end of 2015, representing year-on-year growth 

of  39%.  Official  Accounts  became  a  leading  platform  connecting  users  to  content  creators,  merchants  and 

advertisers. Weixin Pay also became increasingly popular. The volume of red envelopes exchanged via Weixin Pay 

exceeded 32 billion within six days during the Lunar New Year holidays in early 2016, growing by 9 times year-on-

year.

With  increasing  popularity  of  Weixin  Pay,  bank  handling  fees  related  to  C2C  payment  transactions  via  Weixin  Pay, 

mainly arising from money transfers, increased significantly, amounting to over RMB300 million (net of related revenue 

we received from users) for the month of January 2016. To manage these cost pressures, we introduced a new policy 

with  effect  from  1  March  2016.  Under  this  new  policy,  we  charge  users  Weixin  Pay  balance  withdrawal  fees  if  the 

accumulated amount of money a user withdraws from her Weixin Pay wallet to her bank account exceeds a certain 

amount. In parallel, we no longer charge users on Weixin Pay C2C money transfers. We will continue to promote Weixin 

Pay via encouraging users to consume products and services embedded in Weixin, as well as those provided by our 

online and offline partners.

Value-Added Services

In 2015, our social networks business achieved 30% year-on-year revenue growth as we improved our digital content 

subscription services, QQ Membership subscription services, and virtual item sales. Looking forward, we will continue to 

optimize our user experience and add premium content to our subscription services, such as video and music, and to 

our literature service.

In online games, we extended our market leadership in both PC client game and smart phone game markets.

— 

For PC client games, we achieved low double-digit year-on-year revenue growth thanks to increased contributions 

from key titles and new games launched in 2015.

— 

For  smart  phone  games,  we  generated  53%  year-on-year  revenue  growth  on  a  gross-to-gross  basis,  with 

approximately RMB21.3 billion revenue in 2015. We achieved or retained leadership in multiple genres via utilizing 

proven IPs, extending popular PC game genres to smart phones, and developing player communities.

Looking forward, we aim to broaden smart phone game activity in China into new game genres, following the precedent 

of our category expansion in PC games.

Our  cloud  service  business  achieved  over  100%  year-on-year  revenue  growth  as  we  promoted  our  services  to  key 

enterprise  customers  from  a  range  of  verticals  such  as  eCommerce,  O2O  services,  online  games,  online  video  and 

Internet finance. We will continue investing in enhancing our cloud services, supporting our private and public sector 

partners in fulfilling their “Internet-Plus” related initiatives.

7

Annual Report 2015Chairman’s StatementOnline Advertising

In 2015, our online advertising business achieved 110% year-on-year revenue growth, mainly reflecting an enlarged 

advertiser base and more traffic on our platforms. Over 65% of our total advertising revenues was generated on mobile 

platforms during the year.

Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in our brand advertising business, while aiming to grow our performance-based 

advertising business via:

— 

Enhancing  advertiser  tools,  such  as  self-service  advertising  platforms  and  location-based  targeted  advertising 

services;

— 

Leveraging  new  advertising  formats,  such  as  auto-play  video  on  Weixin  Moments  and  eCoupons  on  Official 

Accounts; and

— 

Customizing advertising solutions for specific advertiser categories.

Total revenues

Note:

(1) 

We recognise revenues from smart phone games we publish exclusively on a gross basis from the fourth quarter of 2014 onward, 

primarily  to  reflect  changes  in  our  co-operation  models  that  qualify  us  the  principal,  rather  than  agent,  for  certain  licensed  titles. 

Correspondingly, we record revenue sharing with third-party developers and channel costs of these titles in costs of revenues, instead of 

treating them as contra-revenue items. Net versus gross revenue recognition does not impact the Group’s profits.

(2) 

In light of the reduction in size of our eCommerce business, we include eCommerce in the “Others” business segment in our financial 

statements from the first quarter of 2015 onwards. Comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation.

—  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 27% to RMB80,669 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a 

year-on-year basis. Online games revenues increased by 26% to RMB56,587 million. The increase primarily reflected 

growth in revenues from smart phone games, mainly driven by our diversified game portfolio and, to a lesser extent, the 

impact of the aforementioned adoption of gross revenue recognition. Revenues from PC client games also contributed 

to the increase, primarily driven by our key titles and new games launched in 2015. Social networks revenues grew by 

30% to RMB24,082 million. The increase mainly reflected higher subscription revenues from digital content subscription 

services and QQ Membership, as well as revenue growth from virtual item sales. If gross revenue recognition for smart 

phone games had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2014, revenues from our VAS business would have 

increased by 24%, of which online games revenues would have increased by 23% and social networks revenues would 

have increased by 27% for the year ended 31 December 2015.

—  Revenues  from  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  110%  to  RMB17,468  million  for  the  year  ended  31 

December  2015  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Performance-based  advertising  revenues  grew  by  172%  to  RMB8,693 

million, mainly driven by revenue growth from Mobile Qzone, the full year impact of advertising revenues from Weixin 

Official Accounts, as well as contributions from newly launched advertising services on Weixin Moments. Brand display 

advertising revenues increased by 72% to RMB8,775 million, primarily driven by higher revenues from our mobile media 

platforms such as Tencent Video and Tencent News, which benefited from more traffic.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 35% to RMB41,631 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a year-

on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected greater sharing and content costs, channel costs, as well as bank handling fees 

on C2C money transfers, partially offset by a decline in cost of merchandise sold due to decreased revenues from principal 

eCommerce transactions. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 40% for the year ended 31 December 

2015 from 39% for the year ended 31 December 2014. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of business

Cost  of  revenues  for  “Others”  business  segment  include  cost  of  merchandise  sold  of  principal  eCommerce  transactions  and  other 

eCommerce  costs  of  revenue  since  the  first  quarter  of  2015.  Comparative  figures  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  with  the  new 

presentation.

— 

Cost of revenues for our VAS business increased by 38% to RMB28,422 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 

on a year-on-year basis. The increase mainly reflected: (1) greater sharing and content costs (especially for licensed 

smart phone games) and channel costs; (2) the impact of the aforementioned adoption of gross revenue recognition; and 

(3) higher bandwidth and server custody fees. If gross revenue recognition for smart phone games had been adopted for 

the year ended 31 December of 2014, cost of revenues for our VAS business would have increased by 27%.

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  92%  to  RMB8,941  million  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2015 on a year-on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected greater traffic acquisition costs, investment in 

video content, as well as commissions payable to advertising agencies.

— 

Cost of revenues for our other businesses decreased by 24% to RMB4,268 million for the year ended 31 December 

2015 on a year-on-year basis. The decrease was mainly driven by a decline in cost of merchandise sold due to lower 

revenues from principal eCommerce transactions, partly offset by greater bank handling fees on C2C money transfers.

Other gains, net. Other gains, net decreased by 32% to RMB1,886 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a year-

on-year basis. The decrease mainly reflected a decline in net disposal/deemed disposal gains arising from certain investee 

companies, partly offset by fair value gains on options we own in an investee company, which we recognised in the fourth 

quarter of 2015.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 3% to RMB7,993 million for the year ended 

31 December 2015 on a year-on-year basis. The increase mainly reflected greater staff costs, partly offset by lower fulfillment 

expenses due to a decrease in revenues from principal eCommerce transactions. Promotion and advertising expenses were 

broadly  stable,  primarily  reflecting  higher  marketing  spending  on  products  and  platforms  such  as  online  games,  online 

literature and mobile utilities, largely offset by reduced subsidies to Weixin Pay users for ride-hailing and decreased marketing 

expenses for WeChat. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 8% for the year ended 31 

December 2015 from 10% for the year ended 31 December 2014.

General and administrative expenses.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  19%  to  RMB16,825  million  for 

the  year  ended  31  December  2015  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  greater  research  and 

development expenses as well as staff costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 

16% for the year ended 31 December 2015 from 18% for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Finance costs, net. Finance costs, net increased by 37% to RMB1,618 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a 

year-on-year basis. The increase mainly reflected greater interest expense due to higher amount of indebtedness.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 39% to RMB7,108 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a 

year-on-year basis. The increase primarily reflected higher profit before income tax, partially offset by a decrease in withholding 

taxes.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 21% to 

RMB28,806 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a year-on-year basis. Non-GAAP profit attributable to equity 

holders of the Company increased by 31% to RMB32,410 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on a year-on-year

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain non-GAAP financial measures, 

including  non-GAAP  operating  profit,  non-GAAP  operating  margin,  non-GAAP  profit  for  the  period,  non-GAAP  net  margin, 

non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, non-GAAP basic EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS, have been 

presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a 

substitute for, measures of the Company’s financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-

GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impact 

of M&A transactions. In addition, non-GAAP adjustments include relevant non-GAAP adjustments for the Group’s material 

associates based on available published financials of the relevant material associates, or estimates made by the Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

In 2015, we have included relevant non-GAAP adjustments for our material associates in our non-GAAP adjustments. We adopted the 

new presentation in order to more clearly illustrate our non-GAAP financial measures, and to be more consistent with what we believe to 

be industry practice. Comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with the new presentation.

Note:

(a) 

Including put options granted to employees of investee companies on their shares and shares to be issued under investee companies’ 

share-based incentive plans which can be acquired by the Group, and other incentives

(b)  Net (gains)/losses on deemed disposals, disposals of investee companies and businesses, and fair value changes on options we own in 

investee companies

(c) 

Amortisation of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, net of related deferred tax

(d) 

Impairment provision for associates, available-for-sale financial assets, and intangible assets arising from acquisitions

As at 31 December 2015, the Group had net cash of RMB19,114 million, representing a 10% decline quarter-on-quarter 

mainly  due  to  payments  for  investments  in  investee  companies  and  licensed  content,  partially  offset  by  free  cash  flow 

generated during the quarter. Fair value of our stakes in listed investee companies (both associates and available-for-sale 

financial assets) totalled RMB97,525 million as at 31 December 2015.

As at 31 December 2015, RMB11,617 million of our financial resources (cash and cash equivalents and term deposits) were 

denominated in non-RMB currencies.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Group had free cash flow of RMB16,169 million. This was a result of net cash generated 

from operating activities of RMB18,191 million, offset by payments for capital expenditure of RMB2,022 million.

Annual Report 2015Directors’ ReportCONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WOFEs do not have licenses to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by itself or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History and 

Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group is 

able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts are 

also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to acquire 

the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2015, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has 

been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been removed.

54

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportRequirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2015

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games and the Examination and Approval  of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定”規定》和中央編辦有關解釋，進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進

口網絡遊戲審批管理的通知) (the “Circular 13”) jointly issued by PRC General Administration of Press and Publication, the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly 

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese license holders.

However, Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between foreign 

online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether the State 

General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television will deem the Group‘s structure and operations to be 

in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through affiliated OPCOs that 

hold the necessary licenses for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

Annual Report 2015Directors’ ReportThe risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WOFEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WOFEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due to the legal constraints in relation to foreign investment in the telecommunications value-added services industry in the 

PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the WOFEs 

derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these intra-

group contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and adverse 

impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the tax 

treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimize the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

Annual Report 2015Directors’ Report 
 
Maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board  views  effective  corporate  governance  practices  as  a  priority  of  the  Group,  with  the  aim  of  providing  our  investors  a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how the management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will recognise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will create trust with the public and ultimately create shareholder 

value for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The Company’s corporate governance practices are based on the code provisions as set out in the CG Code. The Board is of 

the view that throughout the year ended 31 December 2015, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the role of the chairman 

and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes at 

an appropriate time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategies and monitors management’s 

execution of such strategies.

By  discharging  its  responsibilities,  the  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be 

responsible, and these matters reserved for the Board have been separately defined, and are reviewed periodically, to ensure 

that the Company maintains the proper level of corporate governance and to ensure they are up to date. In this regard, the 

Board:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual budget and business plan

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned

management

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  dedicates  certain  matters  which  require  particular 

time, attention and expertise to be devoted to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt 

with by the committees as they require independent oversight and specialists input. As such, the Board has established five 

committees  to  assist  the  Board:  Audit  Committee,  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  Nomination 

Committee and Remuneration Committee. Each of the committees has terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers 

and authorities. All committees report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

The Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportAll directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring the Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expenses for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe ongoing education and training, as well as participation in director education programs, is important for maintaining 

a current and effective Board. In order to ensure the directors are aware of their responsibilities as directors of the Company 

and have a proper understanding of the Group’s operations and business, and for the Company to take advantage of their 

rich mix of knowledge and experience, it is our practice that new directors have to undergo an orientation programme and the 

existing directors have to attend a comprehensive, formal and tailored training on their duties and responsibilities as directors 

under  statute,  common  law,  the  Listing  Rules,  legal  and  other  regulatory  requirements  provided  by  external  professional 

advisers. Directors would also regularly meet with senior management team to understand the Group’s business, governance 

policies and regulatory environment. New directors would also receive a directors’ handbook on their responsibilities under 

the Listing Rules, applicable legal requirements and other regulatory requirements and the business and governance policies 

of the Group. Trainings have been and will continue to be provided by external advisers on a regular basis in relation to any 

updates of laws and regulations (including the Listing Rules) which relate to the director’s responsibilities. During the year 

ended 31 December 2015, the Company arranged a briefing on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

environment  and  business  trends  which  are  relevant  to  the  Group’s  business  on  12  August  2015.  Below  summarises  the

Maintaining a high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot depend solely on the Board’s efforts, each of the Group’s

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  in

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of Chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be proficient in IT knowledge and be sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in  order  to  promote  the  different  businesses  of  the  Group.  The  Board  thus  considers  that  a  segregation  of  the  role  of  the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time 

to make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board 

and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly briefed at 

the Board meetings, and together with the senior management team, provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete and reliable 

information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for 

discussion  for  all  items  at  the  Board  meetings.  During  the  year  ended  31  December  2015,  the  Chairman  held  a  meeting 

with the non-executive directors (including the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive 

directors, presenting diversified perspectives for the Chairman to consider.

70

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  Board  is  therefore  of  the  view  that  there  are  adequate  balance  of  power  and  safeguards  in  place.  Nevertheless,  the 

Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary changes at an 

appropriate time.

Composition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board comprised a total of seven directors, with two executive directors, two non-

executive directors and three independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2015 and up to the 

date of this annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 46 to 47 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspective of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company 

quarterly the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant commitments. 

The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that the number of 

independent  non-executive  directors  must  represent  at  least  one-third  of  the  Board.  The  Board  believes  that  the  balance 

between  the  executive  directors  and  non-executive  directors  is  reasonable  and  adequate  to  provide  sufficient  checks  and 

balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of independent judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in an independent, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings and to bring independent judgment and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, policies, performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. The non-executive directors also exercise their independent 

judgment and utilise their expertise to scrutinise the Company’s performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor 

performance reporting.

Further, in compliance with Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules, one of our independent non-executive directors has the appropriate 

professional qualifications or accounting or related financial management expertise, and provides valuable advice from time to 

time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation annually of 

his independence and the Nomination Committee has conducted an annual review and considers that all independent non-

executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing 

Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

71

Annual Report 2015Corporate Governance ReportAs part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

Appointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the right membership of the Board, we can benefit from the right set 

of skills, experience and diversity of perspective to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain the established formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 

It is our corporate governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the 

Chairman)  should  be  subject  to  re-election  at  regular  intervals  and  the  resignation  and  removal  of  any  director  should  be 

explained with reasons. In the 2015 annual general meeting, Mr Li Dong Sheng and Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce were retired and 

re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

Since the Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by 

rotation nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year, code provision A.4.2 of the CG 

Code is deviated. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and development 

of the Group. At present, the Chairman’s continuing presence in the Board is vital to assure sustainable development of the 

Group. Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the relevant 

provision in the Articles of Association has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

72

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportBoard Activity

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed on a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial 

and operational performances, approved the annual, interim and quarterly results of the Group, the appointment of directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, in 

consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agendas for each meeting and all directors are 

given the opportunity to include matters for discussion in the agenda. The company secretary also ensures that all applicable 

rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the Board meeting 

to each of the directors at least fourteen days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary also sends 

the agendas, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least three days in advance 

of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial performance 

and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as promptly and 

fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, such director 

would declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s senior 

management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 

in appropriate circumstances.

73

Annual Report 2015Corporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  ensuring  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. Draft and final version of the minutes of meetings are sent to the 

directors  for  comments  and  records  respectively  within  a  reasonable  time  after  each  meeting,  and  final  minutes  with  the 

relevant board papers and related materials are kept by the company secretary and are available for review and inspection by 

the directors at any time.

THE COMMITTEES

As described above, the Board has established five committees which have delegated responsibilities and report back to the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee.  The  roles  and  functions  of  these  committees  are  set  out  in  their  respective  terms  of  reference.  The  terms  of

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportPricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) is the Group’s external auditor. The Audit Committee annually reviews the relationship of 

the Company with PwC. Having also reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process as well as the independence and 

objectivity of PwC, the Audit Committee is satisfied about this relationship. As such, the Audit Committee has recommended 

their re-appointment at the 2016 AGM.

In  view  of  the  new  requirements  in  respect  of  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  of  listed  issuers  under  the 

revised CG Code which apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, the terms of reference of the Audit 

Committee were revised in December 2015 to align with the revised CG Code. The Audit Committee will continue to oversee 

the financial reporting system, risk management and internal control systems of the Company.

Corporate Governance Committee

The Corporate Governance Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Charles St Leger Searle 

(non-executive director), Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce and Mr Ian Charles Stone (both are independent non-executive directors).

75

Annual Report 2015Corporate Governance ReportDuring 2015, the Nomination Committee reviewed board composition and director succession, and the board diversity policy. 

The Nomination Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive directors and considers 

all of them being independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules 

in  the  context  of  the  length  of  service  of  each  independent  non-executive  director.  The  Company  recognises  the  benefits 

of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a business imperative that will help the Company achieve 

its  strategic  objectives  and  maintain  a  competitive  advantage.  As  such,  the  Board  has  set  measurable  objectives  for  the 

implementation of the board diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience and 

diversity of perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business strategy and maintain the effectiveness of 

the Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy is successfully implemented with reference to 

the measurable objectives. The Nomination Committee will continue to monitor the implementation of the board diversity policy 

and will review the board diversity policy periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong 

Sheng (both are independent non-executive directors) and Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker (non-executive director). Mr Ian 

Charles Stone chairs the Remuneration Committee.

The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2015. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is set

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of each director.

During 2015, the Remuneration Committee:

• 

reviewed  and  recommended  to  the  Board  in  respect  of  the  remuneration  policies  and  structure  of  the  Company  by 

benchmarking peer companies with similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages are competitive 

to recruit the best talents in the industry and to retain key staffs

• 

assessed  performance  and,  reviewed  and  approved  amendments  to  the  remuneration  packages  for  the  executive 

directors and members of the senior management team

• 

reviewed  and  approved  compensation  awards  granted  to  senior  management  team,  to  recognise  their  valuable 

contributions to the Company and to provide incentives for future performances

In conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured  that  no  individual  and  his  associates  were  involved  in  determining  his  own  remuneration.  It  also  ensured  that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned to 

the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

76

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportIn respect of non-executive directors, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fees payable to them taking into account 

the particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

ACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects is presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position in sufficient detail, to give the directors a balanced, understandable 

and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides 

all  necessary  and  relevant  information  to  the  Board,  giving  the  directors  sufficient  explanation  and  information  they  need 

to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information put before them for 

approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the Auditor’s Report.

The Board also has the responsibility to oversee the risks undertaken by the Group, and to actively consider, analyse and 

formulate strategies to control the risks the Group is exposed to, and determine the level of risk the Company wishes to and is 

able to take. The senior management team monitors these risks and develops effective systems and mechanisms to mitigate 

risks to an acceptable level as determined by the Board. The senior management team reports to the Board periodically and 

whenever necessary on the risks the Group faces and the actions taken to mitigate them.

Adequate and effective risk management and internal control systems are key to mitigate risk and to safeguard shareholders’ 

interests  and  the  Group’s  assets  against  any  unauthorised  use  or  disposition.  The  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems  should  also,  among  others,  ensure  the  maintenance  of  proper  accounting  records  for  the  provision  of  reliable 

financial information for internal use or for publication and ensure that the Group is in compliance with relevant legislation 

and regulations. However, such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 

objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board is responsible for overseeing sound risk management and internal control systems on an ongoing basis. The Board 

has established and maintained a set of procedures to provide effective risk management and internal control systems, which 

include:

• 

establishing a distinct organisation structure with defined lines of authority and control responsibilities. Relevant group, 

division or department heads actively participate in the preparation of strategic plans for achieving annual operational 

and financial targets. These plans serve as the foundation for the preparation of the Group’s annual budget by which 

resources are allocated in accordance with identified and prioritised business opportunities. The Board approves the 

annual operating plan and budget on an annual basis

• 

if there are any variances against the annual budget, these variances will be analysed and appropriate actions will be 

taken if necessary to rectify or mitigate any noted deficiencies

IA performs independent review of the operational areas and presents its findings and prospective audit plan to the Audit 

Committee on a quarterly basis

IC facilitates the senior management team to ensure controls in operational processes are efficient and effective, and 

regularly communicates with the Audit Committee

The  IA  and  IC  provide  valuable  support  to  the  Company’s  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  IA  reviews 

different business and functional operations and activities of the Group with a special focus on high risk areas. The IA also 

conducts ad hoc reviews in areas of concern identified by the senior management team. If the IA identifies any deficiencies, 

the relevant group, division or department heads will be notified on such deficiencies, and will rectify the deficiencies and 

IA  together  with  management  will  follow  up  with  the  implementations  of  audit  recommendations  on  timely  basis.  If  the  IA 

considers that the deficiency is a significant internal control weakness, such matter will be brought to the attention  of  the 

Audit Committee and the Board if necessary. The IC facilitates the establishment of the risk management and internal control 

systems with the Company’s management and monitors the implementation of effective risk management practices based on 

the COSO Framework.

In addition to providing advice on setting up and implementing policies and processes to promote effective internal control, IC 

also promotes risk management and internal control awareness to management and employees across the Group.

The overall risk management and internal control status will be reported to the Audit Committee on quarterly basis.

The Audit Committee reviews the risk management and internal control systems annually on behalf of the Board. The Board 

is satisfied that the Company’s accounting and financial reporting function is adequately resourced with staff of appropriate 

qualifications and experience, and that the staff receives appropriate and sufficient training and development. Based on the 

report from the Audit Committee, the Board is satisfied that the Company’s internal audit function is adequately resourced 

and competent to manage the Group’s risks and safeguard the Group’s assets, and that the external audit process has been 

effective.  The  Board,  with  the  recommendation  of  the  Audit  Committee,  is  satisfied  that  the  Group  has  complied  with  the 

provisions regarding internal controls as required under the CG Code and is not aware of any significant issues that would have 

an adverse impact on the effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management and internal control systems.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of 

the Group’s operations, business and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in  annual  general  meetings  and  other  general  meetings  or  other  proper  means.  As  such,  the  Company  sends  notice  to 

shareholders for annual general meetings at least 20 clear business days before the meeting and at least 10 clear business 

days for all other general meetings. In addition, the Company has developed and maintains the shareholders communication 

policy which is available on the Company Website.

78

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the senior management team, under 

usual circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to the Company in an open manner. 

Save as Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker and Mr Li Dong Sheng, all directors attended the 2015 annual general meeting, 

with a view to understand the views of the Company’s shareholders. The company secretary provided the minutes of 2015 

annual general meeting to all directors to have a thorough understanding of the views of the Company’s shareholders. The 

Company’s external auditor will also attend the annual general meeting to answer questions relating to the conduct of the audit, 

the auditor’s report and auditor independence. The Company’s shareholders may also propose candidates for election as a 

director of the Company according to the procedures set out in the Company Website.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the 

requisition not less than one-tenth of the paid up capital of the Company carrying the right of voting at general meetings of 

the  Company  shall  at  all  times  have  the  right,  by  written  requisition  to  the  Board  or  the  company  secretary,  to  require  an 

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, a separate resolution will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a poll, 

detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions from 

shareholders on the voting procedures can be answered before the poll voting starts. An external scrutineer will be appointed 

to monitor and count the votes cast by poll. Poll results will be posted on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s 

website after each general meeting.

Apart from participating in the Company’s general meetings, the Company’s shareholders are provided with contact details of 

the Company, such as telephone number, email address and postal address which are also available on the Company Website,

consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes 

in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting 

policies and other explanatory information.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong 

Companies  Ordinance,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of 

consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted 

our  audit  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing.  Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical 

requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 

statements are free from material misstatement.

Annual Report 2015Independent Auditor’s Report An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated 

financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks 

of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements 

that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 

appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 

evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

OPINION

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  financial  position  of  the  Company 

and  its  subsidiaries  as  at  31  December  2015,  and  of  their  financial  performance  and  cash  flows  for  the  year  then  ended 

in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  have  been  properly  prepared  in  compliance  with  the 

disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

OTHER MATTERS

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not 

assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  value-added  services  (“VAS”)  and  online  advertising  services  to  users  in  the 

People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interest in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer without 

making any payment; and

• 

the right to control the management and financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

92

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 20151 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 43) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the  revaluation  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  and 

financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through profit or 

loss, which are carried at fair values.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(a)  Amendments to standards adopted by the Group

The following amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year  beginning  on  1  January  2015.  The  adoption  of  these  amendments  to  standards  does  not  have  any 

significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

IAS 19 (2011) (amendment)

Defined benefit plans: employee contributions

IFRSs (amendment)

Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle and 2011-2013 cycle

(b)  New Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap.622)

In addition, the requirements of Part 9 “Accounts and Audit” of the new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance 

(Cap.622) come into operation during the financial year, as a result, there are changes to presentation and 

disclosures of certain information in the consolidated financial statements.

(c)  New standards and amendments to standards not yet adopted

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are not effective for the financial year beginning 

1  January  2015,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of 

the Group, except the following:

‧ 

IFRS  15  “Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers”  deals  with  revenue  recognition  and  establishes 

principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, 

timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. 

Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability 

to  direct  the  use  and  obtain  the  benefits  from  the  good  or  service.  This  standard  replaces  IAS  18 

“Revenue” and IAS 11 “Construction contracts” and related interpretations. This standard is effective 

for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted.

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(c)  New standards and amendments to standards not yet adopted (Cont’d)

‧ 

IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 

assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and 

measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model 

and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value 

through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification 

depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial 

asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or 

loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive 

income not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss 

impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and 

measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, 

for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge 

effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship 

between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the “hedged ratio” to be the same as the 

one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still 

required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. This standard is effective for annual 

periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and early adoption is permitted.

‧ 

IFRS 16 “Lease” requires lessees to recognise lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a 

“right-of-use-asset” for almost all lease contracts, with an exemption for certain short-term leases and 

leases of low-value assets. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 

2019. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 is also applied.

The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the above new standards on the Group’s results and 

financial position. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be 

expected to have a material impact on the Group.

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration  transferred  includes  the  fair  value  of  any  asset  or  liability  resulting  from  a  contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured 

at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRS.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations (Cont’d)

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition  date.  Subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  that  is 

deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. Contingent 

consideration  that  is  classified  as  equity  is  not  re-measured,  and  its  subsequent  settlement  is 

accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-

measured to its fair value at the date when control or significant influence is lost, with the change in 

carrying amount recognised in the consolidated income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying 

amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint 

venture  or  financial  asset.  In  addition,  any  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive 

income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related 

assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 

in respect of that entity are reclassified to the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 43(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust” first, and 

then will be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is 

used for the acquisition for the shares of the Company.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a 

shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the 

equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased 

to  recognise  the  investor’s  share  of  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  investee  after  the  date  of  acquisition.  The  Group’s 

investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. Upon 

the acquisition of the ownership interest in an associate, any difference between the cost of the associate and the 

Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill.

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of 

the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 

including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

98

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Associates (Cont’d)

The  Group  determines  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  investments  in 

associates  are  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference 

between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests  in  the  associates.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides  evidence  of 

an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business 

whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, 

even if those assets are in a subsidiary. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

The  Group’s  investments  in  associates  in  the  form  of  redeemable  preference  shares  are  accounted  for  as 

compound financial instruments (Note 2.25).

2.4  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profits  or  losses  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  ventures),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interest  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves 

a business whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute 

a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

99

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.4  Joint arrangements (Cont’d)

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments in joint 

ventures are impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between 

the recoverable amount of the joint ventures and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.5 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The  cost  of  associates/joint  ventures  acquired  in  stages,  except  for  the  change  from  an  associate  to  a  joint 

venture; is measured as the sum of the fair value of the interest previously held plus the fair value of any additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interest is taken to the consolidated income statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised  in  prior  periods  in  relation  to  the  previously  held  interest  is  also  taken  to  the  consolidated  income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.7  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

2.7  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(b)  Transactions and balances (Cont’d)

Changes in the fair value of debt securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale 

financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost 

of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences related 

to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the consolidated income statement, 

and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or 

loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-

sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.8  Fixed assets

All fixed assets are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge. 

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

2 - 5 years

5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to fixed assets when completed and ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.13).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.9 

Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  costs  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated  useful  lives  of  50  years.  Investment  properties’  residual  values  and  useful  lives  are  reviewed,  and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.10 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease or 

capitalised in construction in progress upon completion of construction.

2.11 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the consideration transferred over 

the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 

acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

2.11 Intangible assets (Cont’d)

(b) 

Licensed online contents

The licensed online contents mainly include video and music contents. They are initially recognised  and 

measured  at  cost.  Licensed  online  contents  are  amortised  using  an  accelerated  method  or  straight-line 

method reflect the estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include game licenses, copyrights, computer software and technology and 

non-compete  agreements.  They  are  initially  recognised  and  measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  of 

intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years) using the 

straight-line method reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic benefits are expected 

to be consumed.

2.12 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 43(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as  “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 

at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial 

assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 

reporting date.

2.14 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans 

and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which 

the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets are quoted in an active 

market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

(i) 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 

category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 

classified as non-current.

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated statement of 

financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 

classified in any other category. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 

to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.14 Financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date - the date on which the Group 

commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  asset.  Investments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  plus  transaction 

costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the 

consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 

the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks 

and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit 

or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method.

Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale financial 

assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.

When securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 

value  adjustments  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  included  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement as gains and losses from investment securities.

Dividends on available-for-sale financial assets equity instruments are recognised in the consolidated income 

statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

2.15 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 

on  a  net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right  must 

not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of 

default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.16 Impairment of financial assets

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired 

and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or 

more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or 

events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets 

that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 

impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, 

the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market 

price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  reversal  of  the  previously  recognised  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated income statement.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

For debt securities, if any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between 

the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously 

recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  -  is  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified 

as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the 

impairment  loss  was  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed 

through the consolidated income statement.

For equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also 

evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the 

difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 

asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement - is removed from equity and recognised 

in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement 

on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.

2.17 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The 

Group designates certain derivatives as either (i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 

commitment (fair value hedge); (ii) hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a 

highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or (iii) hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net 

investment hedge).

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.17 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (Cont’d)

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges are recorded in the 

consolidated income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 

attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 

and  qualified  as  cash  flow  hedges  is  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  within  “Other  fair  value  gain 

recognised”.  The  gain  or  loss  relating  to  the  ineffective  portion  is  recognised  immediately  in  the  consolidated 

income statement within ‘other gains/(losses), net’. When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 

recognition  of  a  non-financial  asset,  the  gains  and  losses  previously  deferred  in  equity  are  transferred  from 

equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. Changes in the fair value of any derivative 

instruments  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  are  recognised  immediately  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.18 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.19 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.20 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, money market funds and other 

short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.21 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  share  capital  (treasury  share),  the  considerations 

paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 

equity  holders  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued,  any 

consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.22 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.23 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request the 

Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are met. If 

the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial assets under the put 

option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the 

put option. The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates 

of  payments,  the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised 

estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of revised 

estimated  future  cash  outflows  at  the  financial  instrument’s  original  effective  interest  rate  and  the  adjustments 

will be recognised as income or expenses in the consolidated income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.24 Borrowings and notes payable

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their period using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it 

is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 

occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the 

fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it 

relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction of qualifying assets, which 

are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 

the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. During 

the year ended 31 December 2015, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.25 Compound financial instruments

Compound  financial  instruments  of  the  Group  comprise  redeemable  preference  shares  of  associates  and 

convertible bond of a subsidiary that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder.

The Group either (i) accounts for different components of the compound financial instruments separately or (ii) 

designate the entire financial instruments as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host 

component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument 

as a whole and the fair value of the conversion component, and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. For 

financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  including  derivative,  they  are  initially  recognised  at 

fair value and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 

statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.26 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 

equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  However,  the  deferred 

income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting 

nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 

deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.27 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

2.27 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate entity. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share award schemes), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity 

instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of  the  employee 

services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments of the Group is recognised as an expense 

over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  the  period  over  which  all  of  the  specified  vesting  conditions  are  to  be 

satisfied, and credited to share premium under equity.

For  grant  of  share  options,  the  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is  determined  by  reference  to  the  fair  value 

of the options granted by using option-pricing models - Black-Scholes valuation model (the “BS Model”) 

and  “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the  “Binomial  Model”),  which  include  the  impact  of  market 

performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) but exclude the impact of service condition 

and  non-market  performance  conditions.  For  grant  of  award  shares,  the  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is 

determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date. The Group  also 

adopts valuation technique to assess the fair value of other equity instruments of the Group granted under 

the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation  expenses,  which  are  recognised  in  the  financial  statements,  are  treated  as  part  of  the 

“Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

2.27 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

At each reporting period end, the Group revise their estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. They recognise the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in 

the consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the 

remaining vesting period.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

If the Group repurchases vested equity instruments, the payment made to the employee shall be accounted 

for as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity 

instruments  repurchased,  measured  at  the  repurchase  date.  Any  such  excess  shall  be  recognised  as  an 

expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair 

value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at 

the date of modification.

2.28 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 

the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.29 Revenue recognition

The Group principally derives revenues from provision of VAS and online advertising services in the PRC.

(a)  VAS

Revenues from VAS are derived principally from the provision of online/mobile games, community value-

added services and applications across various Internet and mobile platforms.

The VAS can be paid by way of prepaid cards and tokens (represented a specific amount of payment unit) 

sold  by  the  Group  through  channels  such  as  sales  agents  appointed  by  the  Group,  telecommunication 

operators, broadband service providers, Internet cafes and banks. The end users can register the prepaid 

cards and tokens to their user accounts in the Group’s platforms and then access the Group’s paid online 

products or relevant paid services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid cards and tokens are deferred and 

recorded  as  “Deferred  revenue”  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  (see  Note  26).  The 

amounts are then recognised as revenue based on the actual utilisation of the respective payment units: 

(i) when the payment unit is used to purchase services, revenue is recognised when the related services 

are rendered; (ii) when the payment unit is used to purchase virtual products/items in the Group’s Internet/

mobile platforms, the revenue is recognised over the estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/

items or over the expected user relationship.

Certain VAS service are directly delivered to the Group’s customers through various third parties platforms, 

including  certain  major  telecommunication  operators  in  the  PRC.  These  third  party  platforms  collect  the 

relevant service fees (the “Internet and Mobile Service Fees”) on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to 

a commission fee determined at certain percentages of the service fees (defined as “Channel costs”). The 

Channel costs are withheld and deducted from the gross Internet and Mobile Service Fees collected by these 

platforms from the users, with the net amounts remitted to the Group. The Group recognises the Internet and 

Mobile Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis and treats the Channel costs as cost of revenues.

The Group also opens its Internet and mobile platforms to third-party game/application developers under 

certain co-operation agreements, of which the Group pays a pre-determined percentage of the fees  paid 

by and collected from the users of the Group’s Internet and mobile platforms for the virtual products/items 

purchased to the third-party game/application developers. The Group recognises the related revenue on a 

gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. 

The Group also defers the related revenue, either on gross or net basis, over the estimated lifespan of the 

respective virtual products/items or over the expected user relationship periods, given there is an implicit 

obligation of the Group to maintain and allow access of the users of the games/applications operated by the 

developers through its platforms.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.29 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

Determining  whether  revenue  of  the  Group  should  be  reported  gross  or  net  is  based  on  a  continuing 

assessment of various factors. The primary factor is whether the Group is acting as the principal in offering 

services  to  the  customer  or  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  an  agent  in  the  transaction.  The  Group  has 

determined that it is acting as the principal in offering services, given the Group (i) is the primary obligor in 

the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in establishing the selling price; (iii) has discretion in suppliers selection; 

and  (iv)  has  involvement  in  the  determination  of  product  specifications.  Therefore,  the  Group  adopted 

different revenue recognition method based on its specific responsibilities in different VAS offerings.

Revenues derived from these arrangements are presented as revenue derived from VAS in the consolidated 

income statement.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues comprise mainly display based and performance based advertisements.

Revenue from displaying advertisements to the users of instant messaging, portals, social networks, video 

streaming  and  other  online  and  mobile  platforms  operated  by  the  Group  is  recognised  ratably  over  the 

contracted period, with advertisers and their advertising agencies, in which the advertisements are displayed.

Revenue from performance based advertisements is recognised based on actual performance measurement. 

The Group recognise the revenue from the delivery of pay-for click or pay-for instant display advertisements 

for advertisers to users of the Group based on a per-click basis when the users click on the content, or on a 

per-display basis, when the advertising contents are displayed to users.

Commissions payable to advertising agencies are recognised as a component of the cost of revenues.

2.30 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

116

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 20152 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.31 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

2.32 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.33 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.34 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate.

2.35 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criterias are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development  costs  previously  recognised  as  expenses  are  not  recognised  as  assets  in  subsequent  periods. 

Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the assets are ready for use on a straight-line 

basis over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding five years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency exposures, primarily with respect to RMB, Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”), and USD. Foreign 

exchange  risk  arises  when  future  commercial  transactions  or  recognised  assets  and  liabilities  are 

denominated in a currency that is not the group entities’ functional currency. The functional currency 

of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD whereas functional currency of the 

subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures through natural hedges, wherever possible 

and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, when necessary.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (Cont’d)

At 31 December 2015, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange rates 

of the above currencies against the two major functional currencies of the Group’s entities would not 

result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and 

liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective Group’s entities’ function currency are 

considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange 

risk (2014: Nil).

(ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk mainly arising from the investments that classified as available-

for-sale  financial  assets  held  by  the  Group  (Note  12).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from  the 

investments,  the  Group  diversifies  its  portfolio.  The  investments  made  by  the  Group  are  either  for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of improving investment yield and maintaining high liquidity level 

simultaneously. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of available-for-sale 

financial assets at the end of the reporting period. If equity prices of the respective instruments held by 

the Group had been 5% (2014: 5%) higher/lower as at 31 December 2015, the other comprehensive 

income would have been approximately RMB2,067 million (2014: RMB642 million) higher/lower.

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees 

and investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months and cash and cash 

equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 14, 16 and 17.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable,  details  of  which  have  been  disclosed  in  Notes  24  and  25.  Borrowings  and  notes  payable 

carry at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate risk whereas those carry at fixed rates 

expose the Group to fair value interest-rate risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (Cont’d)

The Group’s borrowings were carried at floating rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate 

risk whereas the notes payable, which representing the larger portion of the Group’s debts, were all 

carried at fixed rates which do not expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate risk.

The Group regularly monitors its interest rate risk to ensure there are no undue exposures to significant 

interest rate movements and regular reporting is provided to the management for the Group’s debt and 

interest rates exposure. The Group may consider to use any interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure 

to interest rates risk, however, no interest rate swaps have been entered as at 31 December 2015 and 

2014.

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2015,  if  the  average  interest  rate  on  variable  interest-bearing 

borrowings  had  been  increased/decreased  by  50  basis  points  (2014:  50  basis  points)  the  Group’s 

profit before income tax for the year would have been approximately RMB42 million (2014: RMB43 

million) lower/higher.

(b)  Credit risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its cash and deposits (including restricted cash) placed with 

banks and financial institutions, other investments, as well as accounts and other receivables. The carrying 

amount of each class of these financial assets represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in 

relation to the corresponding class of financial assets. To manage this risk, deposits are mainly placed with 

state-owned financial institutions in the PRC and reputable international financial institutions outside of the 

PRC. There has been no recent history of default in relation to these financial institutions.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues of on credit terms are made to counterparties with 

an appropriate credit history and the management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk (Cont’d)

A  large  portion  of  Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees  is  derived  from  the  co-operative  arrangements  with 

certain  third  party  platform  providers,  including  certain  telecommunications  operators  in  the  PRC.  They 

usually settle the amounts by them within a period of 30 to 120 days. If the strategic relationship with these 

providers are terminated or scaled-back; or if they experience financial difficulties in paying us, the Group’s 

VAS might be adversely affected in terms of recoverability of the related receivable balances. To manage 

this  risk,  the  Group  maintains  frequent  communication  with  these  providers  to  ensure  the  co-operation 

is effective. In view of the history of co-operation with these providers and the sound collection history of 

receivables due from them, management believes that the credit risk inherent in the Group’s outstanding 

accounts receivable balances from these counterparties is low (see Note 13 for details).

The  Group  does  not  expose  to  significant  credit  risk  arising  from  customers  of  its  performance  based 

advertisements  as  full  advances  from  most  of  the  customers  are  received  before  delivery  of  the 

advertisements  according  to  the  Group’s  policies.  For  other  advertising  customers,  mainly  advertising 

agencies, the credit quality of each customer is assessed, which takes into account its financial position, past 

experience and other factors. In addition, prepayments representing a certain percentage of the total service 

fees for each advertising service are required. Provisions are made for past due balances when management 

considers the loss from non-performance by the customers is likely. The Group’s historical experience in 

collection of receivables falls within the recorded allowances.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital referred to the equity and external debts (including borrowings and notes payable). In order to maintain or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The Group monitors capital by regularly reviewing debts to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 

amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflecting 

financial  health  and  liquidity  position.  The  debts/adjusted  EBITDA  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  debts  by 

adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

expenses.

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2015 by level of 

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

• 

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

• 

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end 

of the reporting period, with the resulting value discounted back to present value; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

There were no transfers of financial assets between level 1 and level 2 fair value hierarchy classifications.

No significant change in the financial liabilities that in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Valuation processes of the Group (Level 3)

The Group has a team that manages the valuation logistics of level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. 

The team manages the valuation logistics at least once every quarter, in line with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  team  would  also  manage  the  valuation  logistics,  and  use  valuation  techniques 

to determine the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments. External valuation experts will be involved when 

necessary.

The valuation of the level 3 instruments mainly included investments in private funds and unlisted companies, 

other  financial  instruments  and  convertible  bonds.  As  these  instruments  are  not  traded  in  an  active  market, 

their fair value have been determined using various applicable valuation techniques, including discounted cash 

flows, comparable transactions approaches, and other option pricing models etc. Major assumptions used in the 

valuation include historical financial results, assumptions about future growth rates, estimate of weighted average 

cost of capital (WACC), recent market transactions, estimate discount for marketing and other exposure etc.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As mentioned in Note 2.27(c), the Group has granted share options to its employees. The directors have used the 

BS Model and the Binomial Model (“Valuation Models”) to determine the total fair value of the options granted, 

which  is  to  be  expensed  over  the  vesting  period.  Significant  judgement  on  parameters,  such  as  risk  free  rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the Valuation Models (Note 

20).

The fair value of share options granted to employees determined using the Valuation Models was approximately 

HKD76  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB60  million)  in  2015  (2014:  HKD508  million  (equivalent  to 

approximately RMB403 million)).

The Group also granted awarded shares to its employees at an aggregate fair value of HKD4,287 million (equivalent 

to approximately RMB3,395 million) in 2015 (2014: HKD3,907 million (equivalent to approximately RMB3,094 

million)).

The  Group  has  to  estimate  the  expected  yearly  percentage  of  grantees  of  share  options/awarded  shares  who 

will stay within the Group at the end of the vesting periods (“Expected Retention Rate of Grantees”) in order to 

determine the amount of share-based compensation expenses charged into the consolidated income statement. 

As at 31 December 2015, the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees was assessed to be 85% (2014: 85%).

If  the  Expected  Retention  Rate  of  Grantees  had  been  increased/decreased  by  5%  (2014:  5%),  the  amount  of 

share-based compensation expenses would be increased/decreased by RMB154 million (2014: RMB73 million).

In addition, during the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group repurchased certain vested equity interests in a 

non-wholly owned subsidiary and exchanged certain unvested equity interests in a non-wholly owned subsidiary for 

the unvested awarded shares of the Company, which have been accounted for as a deduction from equity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  The  estimates  of  the  lifespan  of  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s  Internet  and  mobile 

platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.29(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s 

Internet and mobile platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the lifespan of the virtual products/

items or the expected user relationship periods. The Group uses the available information, including the historical 

user pattern and behavior and the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items, to estimate the 

lifespan of these products/items. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lives of the permanent 

life virtual products/items on a timely basis.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespan of the virtual products/items (provided and to be provided), 

which  may  differ  from  the  historical  period,  and  any  change  in  the  estimates  may  result  in  the  revenue  being 

recognised on a different basis than in prior periods.

(c) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining 

the worldwide provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on 

estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from 

the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax 

liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

Were the actual final outcome (on the judgement areas) to differ by 5% from management’s estimates, the Group 

would need to:

‧ 

Increase the income tax liabilities by RMB80 million (2014: RMB23 million) and the deferred tax liabilities by 

RMB183 million (2014: RMB147 million), if unfavourable; or

‧  Decrease the income tax liabilities by RMB80 million (2014: RMB23 million) and the deferred tax liabilities 

by RMB183 million (2014: RMB147 million), if favourable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The  Group  tests  annually  whether  goodwill  has  suffered  any  impairment.  Other  non-financial  assets,  mainly 

including fixed assets, construction in progress, other intangible assets, investment properties, land use rights, 

and investments in associates and joint ventures etc., are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 

in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been 

determined based on value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of 

judgments and estimates.

Judgment  is  required  to  determine  key  assumptions  adopted  in  the  valuation  models  for  impairment  review 

purpose. Changing the assumptions selected by management in assessing impairment could materially affect the 

result of the impairment test and as a result affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. If there 

is a significant adverse change in the key assumptions applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment 

charge to the consolidated income statement.

(e)  Fair value measurement of available-for-sale financial assets

The  assessment  of  the  fair  values  for  the  investment  classified  as  “available-for-sale  financial  assets”  required 

significant  estimates,  which  includes  estimating  the  future  cash  flows,  determining  appropriate  discount  rates 

and other assumptions. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could materially affect the respective fair 

value  of  these  investments.  We  monitor  our  investments  for  other-than-temporary  impairment  by  considering 

factors including, but not limited to, current economic, market conditions and recent fund raising transactions 

undertaken, the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and other company-

specific information.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s internal 

reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based on these 

reports.

In light of the reduction in size of the Group’s eCommerce business, the segment information previously presented under 

the “eCommerce transactions” segment has been reclassified to the “Others” segment from 1 January 2015 onwards, 

both  in  the  internal  management  reports  adopted  by  the  chief  operating  decision-makers,  and  in  the  consolidated 

financial  statements  of  the  Group.  The  comparative  figures  have  also  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  new 

presentation. The above changes in segment information were taken to better reflect the current operations of the Group, 

as well as the resource allocation and future business developments of the Group.

The Group has following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014:

– 

– 

– 

VAS;

Online advertising; and

Others.

“Others” segment of the Group comprise trademark licensing, software development services, software sales and other 

services.

The  chief  operating  decision-makers  assess  the  performance  of  the  operating  segments  mainly  based  on  segment 

revenue  and  gross  profit/(losses)  of  each  operating  segment.  The  selling  and  marketing  expenses  and  general  and 

administrative expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore they are not 

included in the measure of the segments’ performance which is used by the chief operating decision-makers as a basis 

for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. Interest income, other gains/(losses), 

net, finance costs, net and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. The revenues from 

external  customers  reported  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  are  measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that 

applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other information, together with the segment information, provided to the chief operating decision-makers, is measured 

in a manner consistent with that applied in these consolidated financial statements. There were no segment assets and 

segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to operating segments. Most of the goodwill related to 

the operating segment of VAS. Goodwill is monitored by the management at each CGU level within VAS, such as online 

game business, online literature business and others. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value-in-use 

and fair value less costs to sell.

For online game business, management calculates fair value less costs to sell based on ratios of EV (enterprise value)/

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of several public comparable companies multiplied 

by the EBITDA (ranging from 8.07-14.11x) of the related CGU and discounted for the lack of marketability at the rate 

of  15%.  The  public  comparable  companies  are  chosen  based  on  factors  such  as  industry  similarity,  company  size, 

profitability and financial risk.

For online literature business, management calculates value-in-use based on discounted cash flows calculations. The 

discounted cash flows calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management for 

the purposes of impairment reviews covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated 

using  an  estimated  annual  growth  of  not  more  than  3%.  Discount  rate  used  of  25%  is  pre-tax  and  reflects  market 

assessments of time value and the specific risks relating to the industry the Group operates. The financial projection was 

determined by the management based on past performance and its expectation for market development.

Based on the assessment made by management, the carrying amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

recognised for the investment in a subsidiary had been reduced to their expected recoverable amount by recognising 

an impairment loss amounting to RMB174 million and related tax impact. The loss and related tax impact had been 

included in “Other gains, net” and “Income tax expense” in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 

December 2015.

19  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with limited liabilities in the PRC, appropriation of net profits (after offsetting accumulated losses from prior years) should be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profits (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based  compensation  reserve  arises  from  share  option  schemes  and  restricted  share  award  schemes  adopted  by 

subsidiaries (Note 20 (d)).

(d) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2015,  the  Group  acquired  additional  equity  interests  (including  the  outstanding  equity 

settled and cash settled share options and restricted shares under the relevant employees incentive plans) in certain non-wholly 

owned subsidiaries of the Group at aggregate considerations of RMB9,860 million, which were settled in cash and in the form of 

awarded shares of the Company. The excess of considerations over the aggregate carrying amounts of acquired non-controlling 

interests and the carrying amounts of the liabilities for the cash settled share options and restricted shares of RMB8,160 million 

was recognised directly in equity.

20  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted four share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II and the Post-IPO Option Scheme III, under which the directors may, at 

their discretion, grant options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the 

terms and conditions stipulated therein.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme expired on 31 December 2011. The Post-IPO Option Scheme I was terminated upon 

the adoption of the Post-IPO Option Scheme II.

In respect of Post-IPO Option Scheme II and Post-IPO Option Scheme III, the exercise price must be at least the 

higher of: (1) the closing price of the Company’s shares as stated in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheet on 

the date of grant, which must be a business day; (2) the average closing price of the Company’s shares as stated 

in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheets for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; 

and (3) the nominal value of the Company’s shares. In addition, the option vesting period is determined by the 

Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year or 10-year period after the date of grant of option.

Upon the Share Subdivision became effective, pro-rata adjustments have been made to the exercise prices and 

the number of outstanding share options, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the equity capital as 

that they were entitled to before the effect of the Share Subdivision.

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Valuation Models to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2015 was HKD51.92 per share (equivalent 

to approximately RMB41.01 per share (2014: HKD36.97 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB29.28 

per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, are required to be made by the directors in applying the Valuation 

Models, which are summarised as below.

(b)  Share award schemes

The  Company  has  adopted  two  share  award  schemes  (the  “Share  Award  Schemes”),  both  of  which  are 

administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group (the “Trustee”) as of 31 December 2015. The 

vesting period of the awarded shares is determined by the Board.

Upon the Share Subdivision became effective, pro-rata adjustments have been made to the number of outstanding 

awarded shares, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the equity capital as that they were entitled to 

before the effect of the Share Subdivision.

It represented the effects of adjustments made to the numbers of shares as a result of the Share Subdivision.

During the year ended 31 December 2015, 75,000 awarded shares (after the effect of the Share Subdivision) were 

granted to three independent non-executive directors of the Company (2014: 25,000 awarded shares (before the 

effect of the Share Subdivision) were granted to three independent non-executive directors of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2015  was 

HKD147.94  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB120.86  per  share)  (2014:  HKD120.15  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB95.15 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2015 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from two 

months to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(c)  Employee incentive scheme

For aligning the interests of key employees with the Group, the Group established three employees’ investment 

plans in the form of limited liability partnerships in 2011, 2014 and 2015 (the “EISs”), respectively. According to 

the term of the EISs, the Board may, at its absolute discretion, select any employee of the Group, excluding any 

director of the Company, to participate in the EISs by subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. 

The participating employees are entitled to all the economic benefits generated by the EISs, if any, after a specified 

vesting period under the respective EISs, ranging from up to four to seven years.

Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company act as general partner of these EISs administer and in essence, control 

the EISs. These EISs are therefore consolidated by the Company.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 were 

insignificant to the Group.

(d)  Share options and restricted share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  operate  their  own  share-based  compensation  plans  (share  option  and/or 

restricted share award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the 

share  options  and  awarded  shares  are  determined  by  the  board  of  directors  of  these  subsidiaries  at  their  sole 

discretion. Similar to the share option/award schemes adopted by the Company, the share options or restricted 

shares of the subsidiaries granted are normally vested by several tranches. Participants of some subsidiaries have 

the right to request the Group to repurchase their vested equity interests of the respective subsidiaries (“Repurchase 

Transaction”). For certain participants, the Group have discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using 

either  equity  instruments  of  the  Company  or  by  cash.  For  the  Repurchase  Transaction  which  the  Group  have 

settlement options, there are certain portions that the directors of the Company are currently of the view, that they 

would be settled by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are accounted for using the equity-settled 

share-based payment method. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the addition equity interests in a 

non-wholly owned subsidiary in 2015, the unvested share options and unvested restricted awarded shares of that 

subsidiary are exchanged for the unvested awarded shares of the Company upon their vesting at a pre-determined 

conversion formula. As the fair values of unvested share options and unvested restricted awarded shares of that 

subsidiary and the fair values of the unvested awarded shares of the Company to be exchanged are the same at 

the relevant contract date, no additional share-based payments costs were recognised by the Group in 2015.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2015, the Expected Retention Rate for the grantees from the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was 

assessed to be 85% (2014: 85%).

withholding tax had been provided for the earnings of approximately RMB37,344 million (2014: RMB10,607 million) 

expected to be retained by the PRC subsidiaries and not to be remitted to a foreign investor in the foreseeable future

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. The 

applicable percentages used to provide for insurance premium and welfare benefit funds for the years ended 31 December 2015 and

the  PRC  for  the  years  ended  31  December  2015  and  2014,  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant 

regulations of the PRC after considering the available tax benefits from refunds and allowances. The general 

PRC CIT rate is 25% in 2015.

Certain subsidiaries of the Group in the PRC were approved as High and New Technology Enterprise, and 

accordingly, they were subject to a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15% for the years ended 31 December 

2015 and 2014 according to the applicable CIT Law.

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Company are entitled to other tax concessions and they are exempt from CIT for two years, followed by a 

50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the next three years, commencing either from the first year of 

commercial operation or from the first year of profitable operation, after offsetting tax losses generated in

CIT provision has been provided for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 for the entities within 

the Group which were incorporated in Europe, East Asia and South America to the extent that there were 

estimated assessable profits under these jurisdictions, at applicable tax rates ranging from 12.5 % to 35%.

(vi)  Withholding tax

According to applicable PRC tax regulations, dividends distributed by a company established in the PRC 

to  a  foreign  investor  with  respect  to  profits  derived  after  1  January  2008  are  generally  subject  to  a  10% 

withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong and meets the conditions or requirements 

under  the  double  taxation  arrangement  entered  into  between  the  Mainland  China  and  Hong  Kong,  the 

relevant withholding tax rate will be reduced from 10% to 5%. Hence, the Group used 5% to accrue the 

withholding  tax  for  certain  Hong  Kong  intermediate  holding  companies  which  are  expected  to  fulfill  the 

aforesaid conditions.

Similar tax regulations are also applicable to certain countries and regions.

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates, and the convertible bonds of the subsidiaries should also have potential dilutive effect on the  EPS. 

During the year ended 31 December 2015, these share options and restricted shares, and the convertible bonds 

had either anti-dilutive effect or insignificant dilutive effect to the Group.

37  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2015,  the  Group  acquired  and  obtained  control  of  certain  entities  engaging  in 

online game, films production and literature related business. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was 

RMB1,109 million, fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets), non-controlling interests 

and goodwill recognised were RMB514 million, RMB262 million and RMB857 million, respectively.

The acquisition related costs of the business combinations were not significant and had been charged to general and 

administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The revenue and the results contributed by these acquisitions of the Group for the period since the date of acquisitions 

were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the period would not be materially different if these 

acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2015.

Note:

limited liability company

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these subsidiaries. Nevertheless, under certain 

contractual agreements entered into with the registered owners of these subsidiaries, the Company and its other legally owned 

subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their financial and operating policies, 

appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting the majority of votes at meetings 

of  such  authorities.  In  addition,  such  contractual  agreements  also  transfer  the  risks  and  rewards  of  these  companies  to  the 

Company  and/or  its  other  legally  owned  subsidiaries.  As  a  result,  they  are  presented  as  controlled  structured  entities  of  the 

Company.

(b) 

The  directors  of  the  Company  considered  that  any  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries  that  has  non-controlling  interests  are  not 

significant to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is presented 

separately.

43  SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTROLLED STRUCTURED ENTITIES (Cont’d)

Note: (Cont’d)

(c) 

All subsidiaries’ undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings 

held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company further does 

not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As at 31 December 2015, cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB105,151 

million are held in Mainland China and are subject to local exchange control and other financial and treasury regulations. The 

local  exchange  control  and  other  financial  and  treasury  regulations  provide  for  restrictions  on  payment  of  dividends,  share 

repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities. In addition, the restricted cash, mainly arising from 

the prepayments received from users via online/mobile platforms operated by the Group, of a subsidiary of the Group’s structured 

entity is subject to certain treasury regulations in the PRC.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above, the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without any legal interests. 

In addition, due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 20 (b), the Company has 

also set up a structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes 

which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Company contributed approximately RMB652 million (2014: RMB529 million) to the 

Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
