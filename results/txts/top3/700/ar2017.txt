Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

1. 

Company Strategic Highlights

In  2016,  we  strengthened  our  “Connection”  strategy  by  making  our  social  platforms  more  interactive  for  users  to 

share and communicate, and by connecting our social platforms to a broader range of online and offline services. We 

increasingly sought to differentiate user experience between our QQ and Weixin platforms.

—  QQ  increasingly  catered  to  a  younger  user  base  by  enriching  and  optimising  its  entertainment-oriented 

functionalities.  From  a  social  perspective,  QQ  introduced  a  series  of  features  to  make  chatting  and  sharing 

experience more entertaining, such as facial beautifying tools, painting-styled photos, and animated video stickers. 

From a content perspective, QQ stimulated user activities with entertainment-oriented content such as literature, 

cartoons, and short videos.

—  Weixin focused on providing more convenience to users’ daily life. During the year, Weixin enriched its content 

ecosystem around official accounts and boosted merchant and user adoption for Weixin Pay. In January 2017, 

Weixin launched Mini Program that we believe over time should help us broaden and deepen our service offering 

in low-frequency use cases, connect more offline services to online users, and provide more venues for users to 

sample functionalities offered by apps and thus increase the conversion rate for app downloads.

We also sought to deepen “Connection” between our users and our core business engines:

—  Online games:  Our  online  games  business  delivered  another  year  of  solid  growth.  Through  data  mining,  we 

improved performance of our existing titles and gained deeper insights into player behaviours. In China, several of 

our self-created games such as Honour of Kings, Legend of YuLong Mobile and Naruto Mobile achieved significant 

success, and we reinforced our position as the preferred China publisher for local and overseas game developers. 

Internationally, we expanded our presence via investments in companies such as Supercell and Paradox; and we 

also published a few of our internally developed smart phone games in Southeast Asia.

Smart phone games: Our strategy is to engage a large pool of casual gamers and gradually advance them to mid-

core  and  hard-core  categories.  During  the  year,  we  strengthened  our  leading  position  in  player-versus-player 

games and expanded our presence in role playing games with a series of successful in-house and licensed titles.

PC client games: We strived to serve hard-core gamers better via attractive new content for existing titles and via 

user behavioural insights gained from data mining. As a result, our paying user ratio increased year over year. We 

broadened user engagement with our major PC game titles via eSports, game video streaming, and game interest 

groups. Our integrated PC game community, Tencent Game Platform, plays an important role in introducing new 

titles to gamers.

—  Advertising:  For  key  accounts,  we  increased  our  penetration  by  offering  integrated  solutions  across  brand  and 

performance advertising products. For long-tail accounts, we successfully grew the number of small and regional 

marketers by sharpening our targeting algorithms, and upgrading our self-service tools for campaign management 

and results measuring.

5

Annual Report 2016Chairman’s StatementSocial and performance advertising: Our social advertising inventory remained as a key attraction to advertisers, 

leveraging our platform’s superior targeting capability, unparalleled consumer reach, and premium brand image. 

We innovated around advertisement formats to enable more native and immersive experience for users, hence 

enhancing  performance  for  marketers.  We  enabled  advertisers  and  Weixin  Official  Accounts  to  select  each 

other,  better  matching  relevant  advertisements  with  appropriate  content.  By  improving  click-through  and  sell-

through rates of our existing inventory, we achieved satisfactory revenue growth without dramatically increasing 

advertisement loading rates.

Brand advertising: For video, we prioritised sponsorship advertising to better capitalise on our premium inventory. 

For our news applications, we further upgraded our targeting capabilities.

—  Digital content:  Our  social  platforms  played  an  important  role  in  propelling  user  growth  of  our  digital  content 

platforms, accelerating their growth into successful standalone businesses. Paying users grew significantly during 

the  year  benefiting  from  enhanced  content,  easier  payment  solutions,  and  the  improved  copyright  protection 

environment in China. For video, we expanded our subscriber base via further investments in premium content, in 

particular exclusive content where we are deeply involved in production. For music, we drove subscription growth 

with premium content, achieved initial success in digital albums sales, and boosted virtual gifting consumption 

on  our  karaoke  platform.  For  literature,  we  boosted  user  acquisition  through  reading  channels  on  our  portfolio 

applications such as QQ Browser and Mobile QQ, strengthened our anti-piracy efforts, and sought to enhance IP 

value via original productions of movies and TV series.

—  Payment related services: We surpassed 600 million mobile payment MAU and average daily payment transactions 

in December 2016. Our payment related services provide fast and seamless experience for a widening range of 

offline consumption scenarios such as taxi booking, convenience stores, restaurants, and supermarkets. We drove 

merchant adoption by working with merchant acquirer agencies and simplifying on-boarding procedures. Our fast 

growing commercial payment transaction volume is diversifying from large online merchants to a broad range of 

offline merchants. Our robust payment infrastructure, which made continuous improvements in payment security, 

service reliability and transaction speed, enabled us to process peak volume of 760,000 red packets per second 

during the Lunar New Year.

—  Cloud services:  Through  continued  investments  in  cloud  services,  we  made  several  internally  developed 

technologies available to our corporate clients and partners. We established clear leadership in providing game and 

video industry solutions, and strengthened our position in providing O2O and financial services solutions. During 

the  year,  we  made  continued  investments  in  technology  and  infrastructure,  grew  our  sales  force  and  channel 

partners to drive adoption by more small-scale application developers, and strengthened our overseas capability to 

help Chinese enterprises to deploy their services globally. Our cloud services revenue more than tripled year-on-

year in 2016 as both the number of enterprise accounts and usage of existing accounts increased substantially.

6

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementIn addition, we are investing in forefront technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to position 

our “Connection” strategy for the future. We intend to use machine learning to personalise recommendations  within 

our digital content services, sharpen our advertising targeting capability, enrich social interactions via features such as 

animated face masks, and save costs by optimising our customer service needs.

—  QQ: Smart device MAU increased by 1.7% year-on-year to 652.5 million. PCU including PC and mobile reached 

243.7 million. User activities benefited from our new features such as cmShow, photo beautifying, and animated 

stickers for video. By building AR technology into interactions, QQ attracted 250 million users to open 2 billion 

sponsored red packets during the 5-day Lunar New Year campaign.

—  Qzone: Smart  device  MAU  increased  by  3.9%  year-on-year  to  595.2  million.  User  activities  benefited  from 

upgraded functionalities such as immersive video streaming, live broadcasting, and upgraded photo features that 

allow family members to maintain joint albums.

—  Weixin and WeChat: MAU reached 889.3 million, representing year-on-year growth of 27.6%. During the 24 hours 

of Lunar New Year’s Eve, 14 billion red packets were gifted and accepted on Weixin, up 76% from the same period 

last year.

Annual Report 2016Chairman’s StatementOnline Game Platforms

—  PC client games: We maintained our leadership as the largest game operator and publishing platform in China, 

operating all three top PC client games in China, namely League of Legends, Dungeon & Fighter and Cross Fire. 

In  particular,  League  of  Legends  ranked  first  globally  among  all  PC  client  games  in  terms  of  revenue  in  2016, 

according  to  SuperData.  Smart  phone  games  had  some  negative  effect  on  hours  spent  on  playing  PC  games, 

especially where we operate both a PC and smart phone game utilising the same IP — for example, our shooting 

game Cross Fire. However the combined usage of these IPs across PC and smart phone has generally increased 

substantially.

—  Smart phone games: We remained the top smart phone game publisher in China. For iOS, we ranked the number 

1 publisher in the Global Grossing Chart, according to AppAnnie. Our games generally generate more revenue 

on Android than on iOS, because there are more Android users in China, and some of our games appeal more to 

young users who use Android phones more. We achieved approximately RMB10.7 billion revenue1 in the fourth 

quarter of 2016, representing 51% year-on-year revenue growth, benefiting from portfolio expansion and strong 

operating performance of our major player-versus-player games and role-playing games. As of the end of 2016, 

Honour of Kings surpassed 50 million DAU, setting a new record for smart phone games on our platforms. During 

2016,  we  continued  to  gain  ground  in  role  playing  games  with  the  success  of  titles  such  as  Fantasy  Zhu  Xian 

Mobile, JX Mobile, ZhengTu Mobile, and Legend of YuLong Mobile.

Media and Digital Content Platforms

—  News Services:  Our  news  services,  including  news  applications  and  news  plug-ins  within  our  social  platforms, 

maintained industry leadership in terms of DAU. Tencent News, the most popular professional news application in 

China, focuses on formal and deep news content. By providing attractive and highly personalised casual reading 

content based on readers’ interest graph, Kuaibao established itself as one of the most popular news applications 

in China.

—  Online Video: Our video service ranked first in China in terms of mobile video views. The number of paying users 

exceeded 20 million, more than tripled year-on-year. During the year, we gained initial success in original content 

with popular titles such as Candle in the Tomb and When a Snail Falls in Love.

—  Digital music: We expanded our industry-leading music library and strengthened anti-piracy measures. DAU of our 

online karaoke application WeSing reached 35 million in 2016, more than doubled year-on-year, establishing itself 

as the largest online karaoke community in China. Virtual gifting items have gained popularity on WeSing as a tool 

for the audience to interact with the singers.

—  Online literature: We strengthened our contractual relationships with key authors, and helped long-tail authors to 

achieve better readership via more intelligent content recommendations to readers. The number of daily paying 

readers reached approximately 2.5 million, more than doubled year-on-year, benefiting from reduced piracy.

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementUtility Platforms

—  Security: Our mobile security application expanded its industry leadership, ranking first in China in terms of MAU 

according  to  QuestMobile.  We  won  two  world-class  security  vulnerability  discovery  contests  in  2016,  ranking 

number 1 in both Pwn2Own and Mobile Pwn2Own. During 2016, we strengthened our mobile security leadership 

in  areas  such  as  virus  scanning,  phony  base-station  detection,  anti-fraudulent  phone  number  library,  phone 

memory optimisation, and speed boosting.

—  Application Store: Our application store YingYongBao gained notable market share, overtaking the first movers to 

become the clear market leader. YingYongBao was ranked first among all Android application stores in China by 

QuestMobile in terms of MAU. In addition to application discovery, we also drove user activities with entertainment 

oriented content such as videos, cartoons and literature. During the year, YingYongBao has grown into a significant 

distribution platform for our smart phone games on Android and made meaningful contributions to the growth of 

our social and performance advertising.

—  Browser: Our mobile browser strengthened its industry leadership, ranking first in China in terms of MAU according 

to QuestMobile. Personalised recommendations drove robust year-on-year growth in page views and video views. 

QQ Browser also made significant contributions to the user growth of our digital literature services.

3. 

Company Financial Performance

In fiscal year 2016

We  achieved  48%  year-on-year  revenue  growth.  Revenue  growth  was  broad  based  but  particularly  driven  by  smart 

phone games, social and performance advertising, digital content sales, and emerging businesses such as payment 

related services.

Operating profit grew 38% year-on-year. Operating margin was 37%, down 2 percentage points from the previous year 

due to a mix change in our revenue streams.

Profit  attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 43% year-on-year. Non-GAAP profit attributable  to 

equity holders of the Company increased by 40%. Free cash flow grew 50%. In celebration of the 18th anniversary of the 

Company, to recognise the contributions made by our employees, we granted 300 shares to each employee in November 

2016.

4. 

Company Outlook and Strategies for 2017

During 2017, we intend to further our “Connection” strategy by expanding our ecosystem around our core social and 

communication platforms via initiatives including:

— 

Adding more services within our social platforms to bring more convenience to our users, and to create business 

opportunities for our ecosystem partners;

9

Annual Report 2016Chairman’s Statement— 

— 

Expanding the popularity of our major smart phone games while adding new genre-driven PC games;

Expanding our advertising market share by synchronising our capabilities in brand and performance advertising, 

and growing our number of small and regional advertisers with deeper targeting algorithms and more convenient 

self-service tools;

—  Growing our digital content subscriber bases;

—  Boosting  usage  frequency  of  our  payment  related  services  by  covering  more  online  and  offline  consumption 

scenarios; and

—  Developing our capabilities in emerging technology areas such as machine learning and cloud services.

DIVIDEND

The Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HKD0.61 per share (2015: HKD0.47 per share) for the year 

ended 31 December 2016, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2017 AGM. Such proposed dividend will be 

payable on 2 June 2017 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 24 May 

2017.

APPRECIATION

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  our  dedicated  staff  and  management  team  for  their 

commitment, diligence and professionalism. I would also like to express our sincere gratitude to the continuing support of our

revenues grew by 2% to RMB18,469 million. The increase primarily reflected higher revenues from our smart phone

networks revenues increased by 9% to RMB10,722 million. The increase was mainly driven by higher contributions from 

digital content services, as well as from virtual item sales.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain non-GAAP financial measures, 

including  non-GAAP  operating  profit,  non-GAAP  operating  margin,  non-GAAP  profit  for  the  period,  non-GAAP  net  margin, 

non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, non-GAAP basic EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS, have been 

presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a 

substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-GAAP 

financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impact 

of M&A transactions. In addition, non-GAAP adjustments include relevant non-GAAP adjustments for the Group’s material 

associates based on available published financials of the relevant material associates, or estimates made by the Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

As at 31 December 2016, the Group had net cash of RMB18,140 million. The sequential increase in net cash was mainly 

due to free cash flow generation, recoupment of approximately USD1.2 billion as a result of Supercell financing arrangements, 

partly offset by payments for M&A initiatives and licensed content. Fair value of our stakes in listed investee companies (both 

associates and available-for-sale financial assets) totalled RMB89 billion as at 31 December 2016.

As at 31 December 2016, RMB46.1 billion of our financial resources (cash and cash equivalents and term deposits) were 

denominated in non-RMB currencies.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016,  the  Group  had  free  cash  flow  of  RMB17,156  million.  This  was  a  result  of  net  cash  flow 

generated from operating activities of RMB20,000 million, offset by payments for capital expenditure of RMB2,844 million.

Annual Report 2016Directors’ Report CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by itself or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History and 

Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group is 

able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts are 

also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to acquire 

the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2016, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has 

been unwound as none of the restrictions that led to the adoption of Structure Contracts has been removed.

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2016

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games and the Examination and Approval  of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定”規定》和中央編辦有關解釋，進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進

口網絡遊戲審批管理的通知) (the “Circular 13”) jointly issued by PRC General Administration of Press and Publication, the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly 

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

54

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportHowever, Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between foreign 

online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether the State 

General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television will deem the Group’s structure and operations to be 

in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online and mobile games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through affiliated OPCOs that 

hold the necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

Annual Report 2016Directors’ Report The  above  OPCOs  are  significant  to  the  Group  as  they  hold  relevant  licences  to  provide  Internet  information  services  and 

other value-added telecommunications services. The aggregate gross revenue and net asset value of the above OPCOs that 

are subject to the Structure Contracts amounted to approximately RMB100 billion for the year ended 31 December 2016 and 

approximately RMB18 billion as at 31 December 2016 respectively.

Review of the transactions carried out under the Structure Contracts during the financial year

The Company’s independent non-executive directors had reviewed the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our 

History  and  Structure  –  Structure  Contracts”  of  the  IPO  prospectus  of  the  Company)  and  confirmed  that  the  transactions 

carried out during the financial year had been entered into in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Structure Contracts 

and, had been operated so as to transfer by the date of this annual report Tencent Computer’s and Shiji Kaixuan’s Surplus 

Cash (as defined in the section “Our History and Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company) as 

at 31 December 2016 to Tencent Technology, Cyber Tianjin (formerly known as Shidai Zhaoyang Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited in the IPO prospectus of the Company), Tencent Beijing, Tencent Information Shenzhen, Tencent Chengdu, 

Tencent Information Chongqing, Tencent Information Shanghai, Tencent Shanghai, Tencent Wuhan and Hainan Network. The 

Company’s independent non-executive directors had also confirmed that no dividends or other distributions had been made 

by the OPCOs to the holders of their equity interests and the terms of any new Structure Contracts entered into, renewed and/

or cloned during the relevant financial period are fair and reasonable so far as the Group was concerned and in the interests 

of the Company’s shareholders as a whole. To this extent, similar Structure Contracts were entered into relating to the New 

OPCOs.

The Auditor had carried out procedures on the transactions pursuant to the Structure Contracts and had provided a letter 

to the Board confirming that such transactions had been approved by the Board and had been entered into, in all material 

respects, in accordance with the relevant Structure Contracts and had been operated so as to transfer the Surplus Cash of the 

OPCOs as at 31 December 2016 to the WFOEs and that no dividends or other distributions had been made by the OPCOs to 

the holders of their equity interests.

New OPCOs to use its and its affiliates’ assets and provide services to the New OPCOs. The New OPCOs shall transfer all 

of its Surplus Cash to the WFOEs and its affiliates as consideration. Co-operation committees have also been established 

according  to  these  agreements.  During  the  year,  revenue  sharing  amounting  to  approximately  RMB42,000,000, 

RMB9,000,000,  and  RMB313,000,000  was  paid  or  payable  by  Wang  Dian  to  Tencent  Technology,  Cyber  Tianjin 

and Tencent Beijing respectively. Revenue sharing amounting to approximately RMB21,000,000, RMB109,000,000, 

and RMB358,625 was paid or payable by Beijing BIZCOM to Tencent Technology, Cyber Tianjin and Tencent Beijing 

respectively. Revenue sharing amounting to approximately RMB739,544, RMB6,000,000, and RMB3,000,000 was paid 

or payable by Beijing Starsinhand to Tencent Technology, Cyber Tianjin, and Tencent Beijing respectively.

The risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

59

Annual Report 2016Directors’ Report Due to the legal constraints in relation to foreign investment in the telecommunications value-added services industry in the 

PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the WFOEs 

derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these intra-

group contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and adverse 

impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the tax 

treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

Annual Report 2016Directors’ Report Maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  are  based  on  the  code  provisions  as  set  out  in  the  CG  Code.  The  Board 

believes that throughout the year ended 31 December 2016, the Company complied with the applicable code provisions set 

out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the role of the chairman 

and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes at 

the appropriate time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategy and monitors management’s 

execution of such strategy.

The  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be  responsible,  and  these  matters  are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that the Company maintains effective and up-to-date corporate governance practices. In this 

regard, the Board:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

determines the Group’s mission, provides its strategic direction and is responsible for the approval of strategic plans;

approves the annual business plan and budget proposed by management;

retains full and effective control over the Group and monitors management with regard to the implementation of the 

approved annual business plan and budget;

appoints the Chief Executive Officer, who reports to the Board, and ensures that succession is planned;

approves the Company’s financial statements and interim and annual reports;

determines the Group’s communication policy;

66

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

determines director selection, orientation and evaluation;

ensures  that  the  Group  has  appropriate  risk  management,  internal  control,  internal  audit  and  regulatory  compliance 

procedures in place and that it communicates adequately with shareholders and stakeholders;

establishes Board sub-committees with clear terms of reference and responsibilities as appropriate;

defines  levels  of  delegation  in  respect  of  specific  matters,  with  required  authority  to  Board  sub-committees  and 

management;

monitors non-financial aspects pertaining to the businesses of the Group;

considers and, if appropriate, declares the payment of dividends to shareholders; and

regularly evaluates its own performance and effectiveness.

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has terms of reference which clearly specify its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

The Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

• 

• 

• 

• 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor;

reviews the Company’s financial information;

exercises oversight of the Company’s financial reporting system;

reviews the work done by the Company’s management with respect to risk management and internal control systems; 

and

• 

oversees the risks undertaken by the Company including determining the level or risk the Company expects to and is 

able to take.

68

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe work of the committees during the year 2016 is set out on pages 74 to 77.

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations are 

followed.  All  directors  may  also  obtain  independent  professional  advice  at  the  Company’s  expense  for  carrying  out  their 

functions.

We believe education and training are important for maintaining an effective Board. New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2016, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The chart below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2016:

Mr Yang Siu Shun was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company with effect from 1 July 2016.

Maintaining a high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot depend solely on the Board’s efforts; each of the Group’s 

employees is also required to contribute to such cause. A code of conduct policy with an emphasis on integrity and respect is 

distributed by the Company to all employees and forms part of their employment agreements.

69

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportIn  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

• 

• 

• 

• 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

training has been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

the company secretary attends training in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements; and

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in  order  to  promote  the  different  businesses  of  the  Group.  The  Board  thus  considers  that  a  segregation  of  the  role  of  the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time 

to make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board 

and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly briefed at 

the Board meetings, and together with the senior management team, provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete and reliable 

information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for 

discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Chairman held a meeting with 

the non-executive directors (including the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive directors 

as required by the Listing Rules.

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary 

changes at an appropriate time.

70

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportComposition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of eight directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors and four independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2016 and up to the date of this 

annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board except that Mr Yang Siu Shun has been appointed as an 

independent non-executive director with effect from 1 July 2016.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 45 to 47 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings and to bring professional judgment and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, policies, performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the  shareholders’  interests  being  the  utmost  important  factor.  The  non-executive  directors  also  exercise  their  professional 

judgment and utilise their expertise to scrutinise the Company’s performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor 

performance reporting.

Further,  in  compliance  with  Rule  3.10  of  the  Listing  Rules,  two  of  our  independent  non-executive  directors  have  the 

appropriate professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice 

from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation 

annually  of  his  independence  and  the  Nomination  Committee  has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all 

independent non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 

of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

71

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportAppointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2016 annual general meeting, Messrs Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker and Ian Charles Stone retired and were re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, there is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and 

development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to assure sustainable development of the Group. 

Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the deviation from 

code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

Mr Yang Siu Shun was appointed as an independent non-executive director of the Company with effect from 1 July 2016.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial and 

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  company  secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the 

Board meeting to each of the directors at least  14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary 

also sends the agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in 

advance of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial 

performance and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as 

promptly and fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, 

such director will declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 

senior management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 

expense in appropriate circumstances.

73

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  ensuring  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. Draft and final version of the minutes of meetings are sent to the 

directors  for  comments  and  records  respectively  within  a  reasonable  time  after  each  meeting,  and  final  minutes  with  the 

relevant board papers and related materials are kept by the company secretary and are available for review and inspection by

Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive directors and considers all of them to be 

independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of 

the length of service of each independent non-executive director. The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse 

Board, and views diversity at Board level as a business imperative that will help the Company achieve its strategic objectives 

and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, the Board has set measurable objectives for the implementation of the board 

diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives that 

are required to support the execution of its business strategy and maintain the effectiveness of the Board. The Nomination 

Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy is successfully implemented with reference to the measurable objectives. 

The Nomination Committee will continue to monitor the implementation of the board diversity policy and will review the board 

diversity policy periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong 

Sheng (both are independent non-executive directors) and Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker (non-executive director). The

76

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportIn conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured that no individual or any of his associates was involved in determining his own remuneration. It also ensured that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned to 

the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

In respect of non-executive directors, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fees payable to them taking into account 

the particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

ACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects is presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position in sufficient detail, to give the directors a balanced, understandable 

and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides 

all  necessary  and  relevant  information  to  the  Board,  giving  the  directors  sufficient  explanation  and  information  they  need 

to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information put before them for 

approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the “Independent Auditor’s 

Report”.

Adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s business strategies. The risk management and internal control systems shall also ensure the achievement of the 

Company’s objectives in operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable 

laws, regulations and policies.

The  Board  acknowledges  that  it  is  the  Board’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  Company  has  established  and  maintained 

adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  Board  delegates  its  responsibility  to  the  Audit 

Committee to review the practices of management with respect to risk management and internal control, including the design, 

implementation and supervision of the risk management and internal control systems. This review formally takes place on a 

quarterly basis. The Audit Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems on 

an annual basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the level of 

risk the Company expects and is able to take, and proactively considering, analysing and formulating strategies to manage the 

key risks that the Company is exposed to. The Audit Committee oversees the management of the design, implementation and 

monitoring of risk management and internal control systems.

To  ensure  that  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  effective,  the  Company,  under  the  supervision  and 

guidance of the Board and factoring the actual needs of the Company, has adopted the “three lines of defence” model as an 

official organisational structure for risk management and internal control.

77

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportThe First Line of Defence -- Operation and Management

The first line of defence is mainly formed by the business and functional departments of each business group of the Company 

who are responsible for the day-to-day operation and management. It is responsible for designing and implementing controls 

to address the risks.

The Second Line of Defence -- Risk Management

The second line of defence is mainly the IC. This line of defence is responsible for formulating policies related to the  risk 

management and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk 

control systems. For ensuring effective implementation of such systems, this line of defence also assists and supervises the 

first line of defence in the establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

The Third Line of Defence -- Independent Assurance

The third line of defence mainly consists of the functions of internal audit and anti-fraud investigation under the IA.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing an independent evaluation on the effectiveness of 

the Company’s risk management and internal control systems.

The  anti-fraud  investigation  function  is  responsible  for  receiving  whistleblower  reports  through  various  channels  and  for 

following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the “Tencent Sunshine 

Code  of  Conduct”  (the  “Sunshine  Code”)  and  the  value  of  integrity  to  all  employees  of  the  Company.  The  IA  has  direct 

reporting lines to the Audit Committee. 

These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 

provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Risk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving the risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

through  the  enhancement  of  risk  management  ability,  to  ensure  long-term  growth  and  sustainable  development  of  the 

Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “three lines of defence” model as detailed above) 

which  sets  out  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  relevant  party  as  well  as  the  relevant  risk  management  policies  and 

processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses risk factors that may negatively 

impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures.

78

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportRisk Management Process

Being  an  Internet  company  with  a  wide  variety  of  rapidly-changing  businesses,  the  Company  has  adopted  the  following 

dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

• 

Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

• 

The IC collects, analyses and consolidates a list of significant risks at the company level, and provides input on risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses  and  control  measures  will  be  reviewed  by  senior  management  and  subsequently  by  the  Audit  Committee 

before reporting to the Board;

• 

The IC reviews and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

• 

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which includes designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with supports from the IC.

Significant Risks of the Company

In 2016, the Company identified and determined the significant risks of the Company through the risk management process 

detailed above.

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  the  Audit  Committee  assists  the  Board  in  supervising  the  overall  risk  status  of  the  Company 

and  evaluating  the  change  in  the  nature  and  severity  of  the  Company’s  major  risks.  The  Audit  Committee  considers  that 

management has taken appropriate measures to address and manage the key risks which they are responsible for at a level 

acceptable to the Board.

Below is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. With the growth of 

business scale, extent, complexity and the changing external environment, the Company’s risk profile may change and the list 

below is not intended to be exhaustive.

79

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance Report1.  Market competition and innovation risk

The  Internet  industry  is  highly  competitive,  innovative  and  ever-changing  due  to  the  relatively  low  entry  barrier  and 

evolving preferences of users. Therefore, one of the challenges of the Company is to attract new users while maintaining 

its existing market share. Absence of new technology and product innovation would impair the core competitiveness of 

the Company.

The Company focuses on user experience by keeping track of the development of new technologies in a timely manner, 

capturing changes in user experience, and continuously developing products to meet the expectations of the market. 

In addition, as a proponent of “Internet+” and in order to foster its leading position in the industry, the Company has 

established  a  number  of  open  platforms  and  strengthened  its  cooperation  with  business  partners  with  the  aim  of 

enhancing mutual benefit to achieve the win-win objective.

The Company not only encourages its employees to innovate, but also allocates considerable resources to the research 

and development of new technologies and the optimatisation of features as well as enhancement of user experience of 

products.

2.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high quality user experience. Any material 

functional  defect,  interruption,  breakdown  or  other  issue  in  connection  is  likely  to  materially  adversely  impact  the 

Company’s businesses.

In order to mitigate this risk, the Company has backup infrastructure and a disaster recovery mechanism in place to 

support  disaster  recovery  functions.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  established  dedicated  teams  to  develop  business 

contingency plans and perform periodic drills on the plans to ensure its effectiveness. Various business departments 

are also engaged in emergency procedures, to ensure the smooth operation of the Company’s businesses and business 

continuity.

3.  Acquisition and investment management risk

With the Company’s increased investment activities, it is important for the Company to adopt robust procedures in the 

formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment evaluation stage as well 

as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly manage investment risks could hinder the realisation of investment 

strategies.

The  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously,  and  has,  amongst  other  things,  established  an 

Investment Committee under the Board, dedicated an investment team to identify investment opportunities, appointed 

finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  manage  relevant  risks  and  put  in  place  the  investment  risk 

evaluation and approval process.

In addition, there is a designated professional team that regularly reviews the Company’s cash position and, continuously 

expands  financing  channels  and  capabilities  to  meet  the  needs  from  the  Company’s  business  operations  as  well  as 

acquisitions.

80

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  Company  has  also  designated  finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  support  and  monitor  the 

performance of the investee companies. These teams periodically analyse and review relevant operating and financial 

information of the investee companies to ensure that they continue to satisfy the Company’s investment strategies.

Moreover, the Company has allocated delicated resources from IA and IC perspectives to support management of its 

controlling subsidiaries to continuously established sound risk management and internal control systems.

4. 

Information security risk

Protecting  user  data  is  the  top  priority  of  the  Company,  and  the  Company  is  fully  aware  that  any  loss  or  leakage  of 

sensitive user information could have a negative impact on affected users and the Company’s reputation, even lead to 

potential legal action against the Company.

The Company is obliged to protect sensitive user information and as such, the Company strives to provide the highest 

level of protection to such data. In this regard, the Company has formulated policies and control measures to protect 

user data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, encryption, access restrictions and 

process protocols. In addition, the Company performs review periodically and engages independent specialists to review 

the Company’s data protection practices and provides training programmes to employees to enhance their awareness of 

information security.

5.  Governance policies and regulations risk

Although the Internet and technology industry is still evolving, regulatory authorities in numerous jurisdictions have been, 

in an attempt to keep up with such evolution, developing more comprehensive and stringent regulations to regulate the 

industry. As the Company is continuously expanding its businesses in the PRC and overseas, it is required to comply 

with the new applicable laws and regulations in different jurisdictions that are specifically relevant to the Company’s 

businesses, such as laws relating to data protection, Internet information security, IP, gaming and Internet finance.

The Company has set up several professional departments and teams that work closely with management of business 

groups  to  monitor  and  identify  changes  in  any  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  so  as  to  take  appropriate  actions  or 

measures to ensure the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Company also 

actively exchanges view and information with relevant regulatory authorities on the trend and development of Internet 

industry.

6.  Social responsibility risk

With the diverse products and platforms of the Company and its expanding user base, the products and platforms of the 

Company have gained considerable influence in wider society. The Company’s products and platforms are subject to 

increased scrutiny from a social responsibility perspective.

81

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportThe Company has long been endeavoring to promote the healthy development of the Internet industry, and efforts are 

being made to make the products and platforms of the Company exert a positive community influence. The Company 

strictly controls third party access to the content on the Company’s platform and products and prohibits businesses that 

are  not  in  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations.  The  Company  has  also  established  supervisory  and  whistleblowing 

mechanisms to minimise and manage the spread of illegal and malicious information.

Internal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems,  and  has  been  implementing  the  COSO 

Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure it is appropriate and effective.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define roles and responsibilities of each party as well as authorisations and 

approvals required for key actions of the Company. Policies and procedures are put in place for the key business processes. 

This information is also clearly conveyed to employees in practice and plays an important role in internal control systems. All 

employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational issues that set 

the control standards for the management of each business process.

Management Self-assessment

In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  the  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework,  and 

guides the management of each business group to carry out the self-assessment. The IC is also responsible for collecting 

and summarising the results of self-assessment. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company reviews this summarised self-

assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company, and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of the senior management team of the Company to the Audit Committee and 

the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensure that management has implemented appropriate measures and report the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

82

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportEffectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control

The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, continuously reviews the risk management and internal control systems.

The review process comprises, among other things, of meetings with management of business groups, IA, IC, legal, and the 

external auditors, reviewing the relevant work reports and information of key performance indicators, the management self-

assessment on internal control as detailed above and discussing the major risks with the senior management of the Company.

The  Board  is  of  the  view  that  throughout  the  year  ended  31  December  2016,  the  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems of the Company are effective and adequate.

In  addition,  the  Board  believes  that  the  Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  functions  have  been  performed  by 

staff  of  the  appropriate  qualifications  and  experience  and  that  such  staff  receives  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and 

development. Based on the work report from the Audit Committee, the Board also believes that the Company’s internal audit 

function is adequate with sufficient resources and budget. The relevant staff has appropriate qualifications and experience, 

and receives sufficient training and development.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of the 

Group’s operations, businesses and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in  annual  general  meetings  and  other  general  meetings  or  other  proper  means.  As  such,  the  Company  sends  notices  to 

shareholders for annual general meetings at least 20 clear business days before the meeting and at least 10 clear business 

days for all other general meetings. In addition, the Company has developed and maintains the shareholders communication 

policy, which is available on the Company Website.

The Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board and the senior management team. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the 

senior management team, under normal circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to 

the Company in an open manner. Save as Mr Li Dong Sheng, all directors attended the 2016 annual general meeting, with a 

view to understand the views of the Company’s shareholders. The company secretary provided the minutes of 2016 annual 

general meeting to all directors to have a thorough understanding of the views of the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s 

external  auditor  will  also  attend  the  annual  general  meeting  to  answer  questions  relating  to  the  conduct  of  the  audit,  the 

auditor’s report and auditor independence. The Company’s shareholders may also propose candidates for election as a director 

of the Company according to the procedures set out in the Company Website.

83

Annual Report 2016Corporate Governance ReportPursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, a separate resolution will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a poll, 

detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions from 

shareholders on the voting procedures will be answered before the poll voting starts. An external scrutineer will be appointed to

Internet industry. We will continue to place more emphasis on ESG, encouraging every individual, enterprise and organisation 

to take part in the implementation of our ESG strategy.

87

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance Report“Internet+” has significant implications for our ESG initiatives. Important changes can be achieved through connecting millions 

of Internet users as well as developing their modes of communication and living, and creating more exciting opportunities for 

society. In addition, through the “smart living” system in QQ and Weixin/WeChat, people and public services can be digitally 

connected, facilitating developments in transport, healthcare, environmental protection, public safety and other social arenas. 

This is important for optimising the distribution of societal resources, driving innovation in public services, improving service 

quality,  breaking  down  communication  barriers  and  ultimately  benefiting  the  wider  community.  We  will  leverage  our  core 

capability in the Internet, technology and communication spheres to develop innovative approaches to resolving social issues, 

promoting  social  development  and  protecting  the  interests  of  the  public.  We  also  aim  to  drive  ESG  awareness  in  society, 

through collaborating with our stakeholders and other industry players.

Going  forward,  we  will  continue  to  enhance  our  corporate  management  system  and  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  our 

operations. We will closely cooperate with our stakeholders with the aim of creating a better future.

ENVIRONMENT

We recognise the importance of environmental protection and conservation of natural resources in our business operations. 

Starting from our office buildings in Shenzhen, we have implemented a number of energy-saving measures and we plan to 

adopt  the  same  in  our  office  spaces  in  other  locations.  We  have  also  strived  to  build  our  data  centres  with  environmental 

considerations as one of our key priorities.

Energy Saving Measures taken in our Office Buildings

In order to reduce the energy consumption in our Shenzhen headquarter, we have optimised the air conditioning system, 

upgraded  the  building  automation  system,  and  installed  equipment  with  new  functions  for  better  efficiency.  These 

optimisations  have  enabled  us  to  efficiently  reduce  energy  consumption  for  the  air  conditioning  system  and  for  the  whole 

building, and to reduce our CO2 emissions. This energy saving project has been certified by the China Academy of Building 
Research and accredited by Shenzhen local authority. We are among the first companies which were granted subsidies from 

the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the PRC for the energy saving efforts. The project has set a good 

precedent not only for our other office buildings but also for other office buildings in Shenzhen.

In addition, we have installed a direct drinking water system in our Shenzhen headquarter in replacement of bottled water. It 

reduces the use of plastic packaging materials and indirectly reduces the CO2 emissions generated from the delivery of bottled 
water. This effective energy saving measure will also be implemented in our offices in other PRC cities in the future.

We are also actively involved in the design of our new office building in Shenzhen and have taken energy saving considerations 

into account during the process.

88

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportEnergy Saving Measures taken in our Data Centres

We endeavour to fulfil our responsibility to protect the environment by applying innovative technology to our data centres.

Our T-block west lab is the fourth generation of our data centres and it is the most innovative. It has adopted: (i) photovoltaic 

+ HVDC technology for electrical design which offers a clean and effective energy source; (ii) indirect evaporative cooling units 

to cool down entire block modules; and (iii) machine-learning automated system which monitors the energy level for  rack 

space and minimises the power usage effectiveness (the index of which is lower when it is more effective). These technologies 

tremendously improve the energy efficiency of the data centre. For example, our T-block west lab now only needs 70% of 

previously required energy for the same capability.

In our Shanghai Qingpu CCHP (Combined Cooling Heating and Power) project, we have built a distributed power station that 

uses a natural gas generator and flue gas hot water type lithium bromide unit as the core component for electricity and cooling 

capability required by the data centre. The natural gas-fired distributed power system enables energy cascading. We use high-

quality natural gas with high efficiency to generate high-quality electricity. Steam and condensation produced from the power 

generation are re-used for cooling. The overall energy utilisation can be increased by up to approximately 80%.

For our Qingpu data centre, we have one of the largest photovoltaic grids used by a data centre in the PRC which provides 

100%  clean  energy.  In  phase  one  of  the  project,  we  have  built  3,000  square  metres  of  photovoltaic  grid  which  produces 

300Mwh  electricity  and  reduces  CO2  emission  by  200  tonnes  on  an  annual  basis.  The  solar  panel  on  the  rooftop  is  also 
thermally insulated so it helps save energy in summer.

WORKPLACE

Employee Development and Training

We have a well-established performance management system. A performance assessment for each employee is conducted by 

that employee’s supervisor every six months and employees are required to work with their supervisors to set a performance 

target after each assessment. Supervisors are encouraged to provide constructive feedback from time to time to assist the 

personal growth of each employee.

As employees are one of our most important assets, we have been investing heavily in employee development and training. 

In 2007, we founded our own corporate university, Tencent Academy. Throughout 2016, the number of the average in-house 

training hours per employee was 26.1 while the number of online trainings completed by our employees in total was 157,753. 

Tencent Academy offers different training programmes for each stage of an employee’s career, including an induction, on-

the-job training and leadership training. It has also set up an online learning platform and a mobile learning system in order 

to allow employees to learn anytime and anywhere. We also intend to open up our training resources to our business partners 

and industry players in order to enhance the market standard.

89

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEqual Opportunities and Diversity

We have a full-time staff of 38,775 as at 31 December 2016. Our employment practice is in compliance with applicable laws 

and regulations (including but not limited to those which prohibit child and forced labour) and does not discriminate on the 

grounds of gender, ethnicity, race, disability, age, religious belief, sexual orientation or family status. Diversity is well supported 

in our corporate culture.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation

We  offer  competitive  pay  and  employee  benefits  to  attract  and  retain  talent.  The  remuneration  and  bonus  system  is 

performance-based and designed to reward employees with high performance and great potential.

Benefits

The basic benefits system was built and is maintained in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and market practice. In 

addition, certain special benefits are created to motivate employees and advance our strategy.

We  have  been  voted  as  one  of  the  best  employers  in  the  PRC  for  five  consecutive  years  since  2012  in  a  survey  jointly 

conducted by zhaopin.com and the Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University. We care for the well-being of our 

employees.  For  example,  we  celebrate  special  occasions  of  our  employees  (e.g.  anniversary  of  joining  us,  wedding  and 

festivities) by giving them different employee benefits. We strive to create work-life balance and a safe and comfortable work 

environment for employees. Employees have the flexibility to choose the most suitable insurance plans for themselves and their 

families.

Promotion

Employees may apply for promotion during their interim and year-end performance reviews, provided that they satisfy  the 

requirements with regards to the length of service and performance. Depending on the practice area, the promotion will be 

reviewed and considered by different internal committees. The promotion review process is fair and open – there is a formal 

channel for our employees to provide and receive feedback. The promotion review is conducted in compliance with applicable 

laws and regulations.

90

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportEmployee Departure

We value our relationship with our employees and handle employee departure (whether by resignation or dismissal) strictly in 

accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Work-Life Balance

We have implemented various initiatives such as flexi-time arrangements and volunteer service leave to help employees strike 

a good work-life balance. The leave scheme allows employees to enjoy annual leave, fully-paid sick leave, half-paid leave of 

absence and fully-paid special Chinese New Year leave which are above the statutory standard. Also, female employees are 

entitled to take fully-paid maternity leave, while male employees are also entitled to take fully-paid paternity leave. Employees 

can also apply for one day of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

We  also  organise  a  wide  variety  of  recreational  and  leisure  activities  (e.g.  running,  photography,  music,  dance,  language 

classes) for employees.

Occupational Health and Safety

We strive to provide a safe and comfortable work environment for our employees. There are well-established security and fire 

service systems and food safety monitoring system.

We have a designated team in charge of the physical and mental health of employees. We arrange annual medical checkups 

for  employees  and  organise  health  seminars,  fitness  sessions,  on-site  medical  consultations  as  well  as  face-to-face  and 

telephone counselling from time to time.

Our contribution to social insurance in the PRC is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and we offer various 

supplemental  insurance  benefits  to  employees  and  their  families  (including  medical  insurance,  critical  illness  insurance, 

accident insurance and life insurance).

Communication

We  strive  to  create  a  casual  yet  sophisticated  communication  channel  with  customised  content  for  our  employees.  There 

are  annual  rallies  for  employees  and  management,  face-to-face  discussion  forums,  featured  magazines  and  social  media 

platforms. The corporate strategy and culture are communicated and reinforced through these products and communication 

channels.

91

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance ReportCOMMUNITY

Community Investment

We  set  up  the  Tencent  Charity  Foundation  (the  “Tencent  Foundation”)  on  26  June  2007.  It  is  a  non-public  fundraising 

foundation incorporated in the PRC and a separate legal entity. We commit to donating certain portion of our profits to the 

Tencent Foundation every year for the purpose of supporting charitable works including but not limited to developing an online 

charity platform, poverty relief, disaster relief and education development. As the first charity foundation set up by an Internet 

company in the PRC, the Tencent Foundation promotes the idea of “Charity 2.0” (i.e. everyone can participate in the charity 

work anytime and anywhere, and even small donations count).

In June 2007, the Tencent Foundation leveraged on our Internet technical capabilities and online platforms to build the first 

online public fundraising platform. It is designed, developed and operated by the Tencent Foundation while we provide server, 

broadband  and  other  technical  support  for  free.  The  platform  is  open  for  eligible  charitable  organisations  free  of  charge. 

It  allows  charitable  works  to  be  performed  more  conveniently,  smoothly  and  transparently.  This  is  a  good  example  of  the 

application of the concept of “Internet+”.

Over 4,000 charitable organisations have joined our online charity platform and initiated more than 20,000 charity projects in 

different locations with different focuses. The total number of donations made by the Internet users is approximately 91 million 

and the total amount of the funds raised is over RMB1.57 billion.

As of 31 December 2016, our Group and our employees have donated over RMB1.9 billion and RMB60 million in total to the 

Tencent Foundation respectively since its establishment. During the year 2016, our Group and our employees have donated 

RMB570 million and RMB10.5 million to the Tencent Foundation respectively.

In addition to operating the online charity platform, the Tencent Foundation is also actively involved in charity work in the 

following areas: (i) disaster relief; (ii) rural development; (iii) education; (iv) ecological conservation and cultural preservation; (v) 

community development; and (vi) medical care.

92

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportDisaster relief

In response to recent natural disasters in the PRC as well as globally, the Tencent Foundation has created a multifaceted 

disaster relief model by combining our various products including online platforms, instant messengers, online payment and 

Internet search to help the public follow the latest news, participate in rescue efforts and make donations. In addition, the 

Tencent  Foundation  has  made  donations  to  support  the  rescue  missions  and  post-disaster  reconstructions.  For  example, 

the  Tencent  Foundation  donated  RMB2  million  for  the  earthquake  in  Nepal  in  2015  and  paid  the  transportation  costs  of 

RMB100,000  for  the  relief  supplies.  In  2016,  it  donated  approximately  RMB4  million  to  support  the  emergency  rescue 

missions in the PRC floods.

Rural development

In 2009, the Tencent Foundation donated no less than RMB50 million on an experimental charity project in Yunnan for the 

purpose of rediscovering the value of villages and connecting villagers by increasing Internet penetration in rural areas.

Education

The Tencent Foundation has set up scholarships to promote education in the PRC, Hong Kong and other countries throughout 

the  years.  There  are  also  specific  donations  for  different  education  initiatives.  For  example,  it  donated  RMB100  million  to 

support the future education reform in a secondary school in Shenzhen. In 2013, it also set up a RMB1 million fund to sponsor 

the five-year development programme of a secondary school in Sichuan after the earthquake of that year. In 2016, it donated 

RMB5.35 million in aggregate in the education related projects.

Ecological conservation and cultural preservation

The  Tencent  Foundation  is  keen  on  environmental  protection  and  cultural  preservation.  For  example,  it  donated  RMB6.1 

million to the Sichuan Western Nature Preservation Foundation in 2015 and RMB12.5 million to the China Foundation for 

Cultural Heritage Conservation for the establishment of “Great Wall Funds” in 2016.

93

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance ReportCommunity development

The Tencent Foundation has sponsored charitable organisations such as the China Charity Foundation Development Centre, 

the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Charity Alliance.

Medical care

The Tencent Foundation has donated approximately RMB13 million in aggregate to help underprivileged children with medical 

conditions (such as autism and cerebral palsy) in developing areas. For example, in 2016, it donated RMB5 million to the 

Ai You Foundation to set up two child focused medical care centres for orphaned patients in Chongqing and Urumqi. It also 

donated RMB200,000 to the Shenzhen Children’s Hospital to build an interactive activity room “Vcare” for children patients.

Volunteering

In  2006,  some  of  our  employees  founded  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  on  their  own  initiative  in  response  to  our 

corporate  vision  of  being  “the  most  respected  Internet  company”.  Since  then,  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  has 

contributed more than 100,000 hours of voluntary services. We launch more than 200 volunteering activities with more than 

5,000 participants every year. In 2016, the Tencent Volunteers’ Association was awarded a spot in the list of Top 10 Best 

Volunteer Organisations in Guangdong Province.

There are eight sub-divisions under the Tencent Volunteers’ Association in various cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu 

and Guangzhou. These sub-divisions include poverty support, scholarship, environmental protection, care for children with 

special needs and green network. The Tencent Volunteers’ Association works closely with the Tencent Foundation in relation to 

the funding of the projects.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association combines its expertise in technology to help the community. For example, it has set up 

an online platform to help search for missing persons with the assistance of our marketing and advertising resources  and 

technology. As at the date of this report, more than 40 missing children have been found through our platform.

In order to encourage employees to participate in volunteer service, employees, since April 2012, have been granted one day 

of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

94

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-Corruption

In 2005, we formulated the Sunshine Code based on the core value of the Group –“Integrity”. All employees of the entire 

Group are required to follow and to strictly comply with the Sunshine Code. It expressly prohibits all kinds of fraudulent activity, 

bribery, and any other activities which are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To ensure our employees 

comply with the requirements stipulated in the Sunshine Code, all employees are required to complete e-learning programmes 

and attend various face-to-face training programmes introducing the rules and standards of the Sunshine Code on a regular 

basis.

Concurrently, in order to protect and safeguard the interests of the Group and to maintain integrity in the Group’s business 

dealings, we have adopted an Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy (the “Policy”), which clearly conveys the message of zero-

tolerance in relation to fraudulent activity to all the employees and suppliers/business partners. All employees and suppliers/

business partners are encouraged to report genuine concerns about any potential fraudulent activities. The Policy outlines 

the multiple whistleblowing channels and how the Group should deal with such concerns, so that employees and suppliers/

business partners can report their good faith concerns without fear of reprisal or potential retaliation.

When a report of suspected fraudulent activities is received, the anti-fraud investigation team, which consists of professionals 

with  profound  knowledge  in  fraud  risk  management  and  solid  fraud  investigation  experiences,  is  assigned  to  handle  the 

investigation independently. After an investigation has been completed, the employee found and proven to have committed 

such fraud shall be subject to immediate dismissal, and corrective actions shall be taken in response to the findings at the 

same time. In the event that any fraudulent activity violates any relevant laws or regulations, such cases shall be reported to 

government authorities.

95

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-Money Laundering

In 2016, the Group strictly abided by all applicable laws and regulations on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing, 

and fulfilled its social responsibilities and legal obligations on anti-money laundering.

We treat financial security as the lifeline of our business and have implemented sound financial crime control mechanisms in 

our business development. We have robust systems and measures to detect, deter and protect our business from involvement 

in financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Our protective measures include, but are not limited to, 

the following:

Three lines of defence

Our first line of defence is the product team and the business development team. The risk management team and anti-money 

laundering team serve as the second line while the internal audit team acts as the third line of defence.

Anti-money laundering and internal control systems

We  have:  (i)  formulated  a  set  of  anti-money  laundering  policies  based  on  the  applicable  anti-money  laundering  laws  and 

regulations; (ii) implemented an anti-money laundering monitoring system; and (iii) set up a dedicated anti-money laundering 

team,  which  is  solely  responsible  for  compliance  management,  anti-money  laundering  name  screening  and  suspicious 

transaction monitoring.

Other control measures

We have further improved the anti-money laundering compliance and internal risk control mechanisms by: (i) recruiting more 

anti-money laundering professionals for suspicious transaction review and analysis in order to enhance the effectiveness and 

specialisation level of anti-money laundering; (ii) strengthening the requirements for the know-your-customer procedures; (iii) 

enhancing the overall monitoring system of suspicious transaction and manual analysis; (iv) cooperating with regulators and 

law enforcement on anti-money laundering investigation; (v) actively participating in the strike on terrorism and corruption 

internationally, in order to prevent money laundering and upstream criminal activities; and (vi) carrying out various forms of

96

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Our  supply  chain  management  programme  attaches  supreme  importance  to  managing  the  ethics  risk  associated  with  the 

relationship between our procurement employees and our business partners. It also focuses on teaching those employees who 

are involved in procurement to recognise and mitigate the inherent risks.

To  enhance  the  social  responsibility  awareness  of  our  employees,  we  have  formulated  a  code  of  conduct  which  those 

employees engaging in procurement activities must adhere to. To minimise the ethics risks, such employees are also required 

to declare any relationship they may have with our suppliers in writing.

In  the  course  of  supplier  engagement,  potential  suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  self-assessment  on  their  commitment, 

amongst other things, to environmental protection, social responsibility, and health and safety at work (the “Self-Assessment”). 

Suppliers which are formally engaged by us are also required to agree to the terms of a declaration and undertaking in relation 

to anti-commercial bribery in doing business with our Group (the “Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration”).

During the year ended 31 December 2016, all suppliers which were formally engaged have completed the Self-Assessment 

and signed the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration. We are not aware of any of our suppliers engaging in commercial bribery, 

or being materially and adversely affected by issues relating to environmental and social responsibility.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

We strive to provide the best user experience and pay high attention to the quality of our products and services. We conduct 

strict reviews of our product and service offerings and related sales and marketing strategies and materials to ensure their 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We also build in safeguards on user privacy, product safety and IP rights as 

described below.

User Privacy

To uphold our dedication to value creation for our users, amongst other user specific aims, one of our important missions is to 

protect the privacy of user data and other sensitive information. We comply with all the applicable laws on privacy protection, 

and incorporate applicable legal and regulatory requirements on privacy protection into our internal compliance policies taking 

into account the specific features of our products and services.

We have a dedicated privacy team within the Legal Department which is responsible for handling data protection matters. 

We have devised specific procedures to collect and process user data to ensure that we provide our products and services in 

accordance with applicable legal requirements. We evaluate specific products from the perspective of privacy protection on 

a regular basis and perform privacy risk assessments before the launch of new products to ensure that our products are not 

exposed to the risk of privacy infringement or leakage of user data.

97

Annual Report 2016Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe provide training to our employees to enhance their privacy protection awareness and build up the cultural awareness of the 

importance of privacy protection.

To ensure that our users understand how we protect their personal information and enhance the transparency of how  we 

collect and process the data, we publish our privacy protection policies on our product websites and in-app products. We also 

provide communication channels for our users to file complaints and raise enquiries whenever they are in doubt.

We  actively  participate  in  shaping  the  development  of  the  industry  framework  on  privacy  protection  and  we  have  been 

accredited with privacy certifications from TRUSTe for WeChat, which is the leading global data privacy management company 

and powers trust in the data economy by enabling businesses to safely collect and use customer data across web, mobile, 

cloud and advertising channels.

Healthy Environment for our Users

One  of  our  important  businesses  is  our  online  gaming  business.  We  need  to  comply  with  the  laws,  regulations  and  policy 

requirements in relation to online gaming in the PRC.

The government authorities in the PRC which regulate the online gaming business include: (i) the Ministry of Culture; (ii) the 

State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television; (iii) the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; 

and (iv) the State Administration for Industry & Commerce.

The  laws,  regulations  and  policies  relating  to  online  gaming  mainly  include:  (i)  “The  Regulation  on  Internet  Information 

Service of the People’s Republic of China” promulgated by the State Council; (ii) “The Provisions on the Administration of 

Online Publishing Services” promulgated by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the 

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (iii) “The Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Culture”

We are a technology-oriented company and we stress the importance of the observation and protection of IP rights. We have 

established a dedicated IP team with approximately 80 employees as of 31 December 2016 that is responsible for the day-to-

day management of legal matters involving trademark, patent, copyright, domain names and other IP rights.

We began a comprehensive programme for the management of IP at an early stage. We have consistently applied for  the 

registration of IP rights since the early stages of its establishment. With the successful development of our business, we have 

expanded our global IP portfolio to cover more than 100 countries and regions. As of 31 December 2016, we had obtained 

over 10,000 officially registered trademarks and over 5,000 issued patents. Coupled with our creation of a vast amount of 

copyrighted  content,  we  have  accumulated  IP  assets  of  considerable  value.  Our  IP  team  has  developed  a  comprehensive 

database for our patents, trademarks and copyrights and our strong data analytical skills enable us to manage and monitor 

our IP rights in a meticulous and efficient manner. To combat infringement of IP rights, our IP team has also established a 

comprehensive and efficient monitoring and maintenance system, and has devised various civil, criminal and administrative 

enforcement measures to enforce our IP rights. Please see further details on the Company Website (https://www.tencent.com/

legal/html/en-us/property.html).

We  actively  participate  in  public  affairs  and  strive  to  promote  the  awareness  of  IP  protection  in  the  Internet  industry.  As 

members of the China National Information Technology Standardisation Committee, the China Intellectual Property Society, 

the Patent Protection Association of China, the World Wide Web Consortium, the International Trademark Association and 

the China Trademark Association, we have participated in the consultations on legislative amendments to the PRC laws and 

regulations  relating  to  patents,  trademarks  and  anti-competition  and  have  made  recommendations  in  the  development  of 

industry standards.

Within  the  past  decade,  we  have  several  times  been  awarded  “China  Patent  Gold  Awards”  by  the  State  Intellectual 

Property Office of the PRC and “China Trademark Awards” jointly by World Intellectual Property Organization and the State 

Administration for Industry & Commerce of the PRC, signifying our contribution to the development of independent innovation 

of the PRC. We have also several times been awarded “National Copyright Demonstration Unit”, recognising our outstanding 

performance in management and protection of copyright.

Looking forward, we will continue to devote great efforts and resources to observe and protect IP rights.

Annual Report 2016Independent Auditor’s Report OTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

106

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•  

•  

•  

•  

•  

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

107

Annual Report 2016Independent Auditor’s Report We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Wilson W. Y. Chow.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  value-added  services  (“VAS”)  and  online  advertising  services  to  users  in  the 

People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interest in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer without 

making any payment; and

 • 

the right to control the management and financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

118

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 20161 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 46) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 46.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the  revaluation  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets  and 

derivative financial instruments, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(a)  Amendments to standards adopted by the Group

The following amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year beginning on 1 January 2016. The adoption of these amendments does not have any significant impact 

on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

IFRS 11 (amendment)

Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations

IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendment)  Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation

IAS 1 (amendment) 

Disclosure initiative

IFRSs (amendment)

Annual improvements 2014

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are not effective for the financial year beginning 

1  January  2016,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of 

the Group, except for set out below:

(i) 

IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”

IFRS  15  “Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers”  replaces  IAS  18  “Revenue”  and  IAS  11 

“Construction contracts” and related interpretations. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains 

control of a goods or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from 

the  goods  or  service.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January 

2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified 

retrospective approach for the adoption. At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt this standard 

before its effective date while a full retrospective approach is expected to be applied upon the adoption.

Management is currently assessing the effects of applying the new standard on the Group’s financial 

statements  and  has  identified  that  the  application  of  IFRS  15  may  affect  the  measurement  and 

timing of recognition of revenues as a result of identification of different performance obligations and 

behaviors  of  different  customers  portfolios.  At  this  stage,  the  Group  is  not  in  a  position  to  estimate 

the impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements while the Group will make more detailed 

assessments of the impact over the next twelve months.

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective (Cont’d)

(ii) 

IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”

IFRS  9  “Financial  instruments”  addresses  the  classification,  measurement  and  derecognition  of 

financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  introduces  new  rules  for  hedge  accounting  and  a  new 

impairment model for financial assets.

IFRS  9  retains  but  simplifies  the  mixed  measurement  model  and  establishes  three  primary 

measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 

income  and  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  Investments  in  equity  instruments  are  required  to  be 

measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes 

in fair value in other comprehensive income which will not be recycling to the profit and loss. While 

management of the Group has just commenced an assessment on the classification and measurement 

of its financial assets, the potential impact to the future financial statements has yet to be determined 

but  management  considers  that  certain  investments  in  equity  instruments  currently  classified  as 

available-for-sale financial assets might fall within the classification as at fair value through profit or 

loss, hence, there might be a change to the accounting of these assets.

There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only 

affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss, while 

the Group does not have any such liabilities.

The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 

Measurement” and have not been changed.

The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with 

the Group’s established risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge relationships might 

be  eligible  for  hedge  accounting,  given  the  standard  introduces  a  more  principle-based  approach. 

Nevertheless,  the  Group  has  not  yet  undertaken  a  detailed  assessment  but  management  expect 

that the Group’s current hedge relationships might likely be qualified as continuing hedges upon the 

adoption of IFRS 9.

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective (Cont’d)

(ii) 

IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” (Cont’d)

The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit 

losses rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. It applies to financial assets 

classified  at  amortised  cost,  debt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive 

income, contract assets under IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, lease receivables, 

loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts. While the Group has not yet undertaken 

a  detailed  assessment  of  how  its  impairment  provisions  would  be  affected  by  the  new  model, 

management expects it might result in an earlier recognition of credit losses.

The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. 

These  are  expected  to  change  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  Group’s  disclosures  about  its  financial 

instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.

IFRS 9 must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is 

permitted. The Group does not intend to adopt this standard before its mandatory effective date.

(iii) 

IFRS 16 “Lease”

IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the 

distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the 

right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions 

are short-term and low-value leases.

The  accounting  for  lessors  will  not  significantly  change.  The  standard  will  affect  primarily  the 

accounting for Group’s operating leases. However, the Group has just commenced its assessment and 

have not yet determined to what extent its commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a 

liability for future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows.

The new standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The Group 

does not intend to adopt this standard before its effective date.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration  transferred  includes  the  fair  value  of  any  asset  or  liability  resulting  from  a  contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured 

at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations (Cont’d)

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition  date.  Subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  that  is 

deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. Contingent 

consideration  that  is  classified  as  equity  is  not  re-measured,  and  its  subsequent  settlement  is 

accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or financial asset. In 

addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 46(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a 

shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the 

equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased 

to  recognise  the  investor’s  share  of  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  investee  after  the  date  of  acquisition.  The  Group’s 

investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. Upon 

the acquisition of the ownership interest in an associate, any difference between the cost of the associate and the 

Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill.

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of 

the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 

including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Associates (Cont’d)

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.4), are impaired. If this is the 

case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 

investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated 

income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests  in  the  associates.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides  evidence  of 

an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business 

whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, 

even if those assets are in a subsidiary. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

The Group’s investments in associates in the form of redeemable instruments are accounted for as compound 

financial instruments (Note 2.27).

2.4  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profits  or  losses  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  ventures),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interest  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves 

a business whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute 

a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.5 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The  cost  of  associates/joint  ventures  acquired  in  stages,  except  for  the  change  from  an  associate  to  a  joint 

venture; is measured as the sum of the fair value of the interest previously held plus the fair value of any additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interest is taken to the consolidated income statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised  in  prior  periods  in  relation  to  the  previously  held  interest  is  also  taken  to  the  consolidated  income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Partial disposal of associates to available-for-sale financial assets

When the Group loses significant influence over an associate, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A 

profit or loss is recognised at any difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus any proceeds from 

disposing of the part interest in the associate and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity 

method was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income by an associate 

should  be  reclassified  to  the  consolidated  income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as 

specified and permitted by applicable IFRSs when the Group loses significant influence over the associate.

2.7  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.8  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.8  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Changes in the fair value of debt securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale 

financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost 

of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences related 

to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the consolidated income statement, 

and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or 

loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-

sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.9  Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs includes expenditure that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

2 - 5 years

5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.14).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.10 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  costs  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.11 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease or 

capitalised in construction in progress upon completion of construction.

2.12 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the consideration transferred over 

the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 

acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

(b) 

Licensed online contents

The licensed online contents mainly include video and music contents. They are initially recognised  and 

measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  of  intangible  assets  acquired  through  business  combinations. 

Licensed online contents are amortised using a straight-line method or accelerated method which reflect the 

estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include game licences, copyrights, computer software and technology and 

non-compete  agreements.  They  are  initially  recognised  and  measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  of 

intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years) using the 

straight-line method which reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic benefits are 

expected to be consumed.

2.13 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 46(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as  “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.14 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at 

the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets 

other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting 

date.

2.15 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The  Group  classifies  its  financial  assets  in  the  following  categories:  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through 

profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends  on 

the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets 

are quoted in an active market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 

recognition.

(i) 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 

category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 

classified as non-current.

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated statement of 

financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 

classified in any other category. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 

to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.15 Financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the Group 

commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  asset.  Investments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  plus  transaction 

costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the 

consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 

the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks 

and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit 

or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method.

Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale financial 

assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.

When securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 

value  adjustments  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  included  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement as gains and losses from investment securities.

Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the 

consolidated  income  statement  as  part  of  other  income.  Dividends  on  available-for-sale  financial  assets 

equity instruments are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Group’s right to receive 

payments is established.

2.16 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 

on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right  must 

not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of 

default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

2.17 Impairment of financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset 

or a group of financial assets is impaired.

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is 

objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 

of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows 

of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 

impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, 

the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market 

price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  reversal  of  the  previously  recognised  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated income statement.

2.17 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

For equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also 

evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the 

difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 

asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement – is removed from equity and recognised 

in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement 

on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.

For debt securities, if any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between 

the acquisition cost (net of any principle repayment and amortisation) and the current fair value, less any 

impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  -  is 

reclassified from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the 

fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively 

related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement, 

the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.

2.18 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The 

Group designates certain derivatives as either (i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 

commitment (fair value hedge); (ii) hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a 

highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or (iii) hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net 

investment hedge).

The  Group  documents  at  the  inception  of  the  transaction  the  relationship  between  hedging  instruments  and 

hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 

The  Group  also  documents  its  assessment,  both  at  hedge  inception  and  on  an  ongoing  basis,  of  whether  the 

derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 

flows of hedged items.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.18 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (Cont’d)

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges are recorded in the 

consolidated income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 

attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 

and qualified as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 

ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement within “other gains/(losses), 

net”. When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and 

losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost 

of the asset.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 

immediately in the consolidated income statement in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.19 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.20 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.21 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, money market funds and other 

short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

2.22 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury share), the considerations 

paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 

equity  holders  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued,  any 

consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.23 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.24 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request the 

Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are met. If 

the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial assets under the put 

option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the 

put option. The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates 

of  payments,  the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised 

estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of revised 

estimated  future  cash  outflows  at  the  financial  instrument’s  original  effective  interest  rate  and  the  adjustments 

will be recognised as income or expenses in the consolidated income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.25 Financial guarantee contracts

The financial guarantee contract of the Group is the contract that represents guarantee provided by the Group in 

respect of a put arrangement granted by an investee to the employees of its subsidiary.

The financial guarantee is initially recognised in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantee 

was given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the 

higher of the initial amount, less amortisation of fees recognised in accordance with IAS 18, and the best estimate 

of the amount required to settle the guarantee.

2.26 Borrowings and notes payable

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their period using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it 

is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 

occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the 

fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it 

relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction of qualifying assets, which 

are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 

the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. During 

the year ended 31 December 2016, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.27 Compound financial instruments

Compound  financial  instruments  held  by  the  Group  comprise  equity  instruments  with  redemption  features  of 

associates and convertible bonds of a subsidiary that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder.

The Group either (i) accounts for different components of the compound financial instruments separately or (ii) 

designate the entire financial instruments as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host 

component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as 

a whole and the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The subsequent measurement of the host component and 

embedded derivatives follow the respective accounting policy of financial instruments as stated in Notes 2.15 and 

2.18.

For convertible bonds issued by a subsidiary of the Group, the entire instrument is designated as liabilities at fair 

value through profit or loss including derivative, they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried 

at fair value with changes in fair value recognised.

2.28 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 

equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  However,  the  deferred 

income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting 

nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 

deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.28 Current and deferred income tax (Cont’d)

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally the 

Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only when there is an agreement 

in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, 

deferred tax liability in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from the associate’s undistributed profits is 

not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.29 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate entity. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants as consideration for equity instruments (including share options and awarded shares)  of  the 

Group. The fair value of the employee and other qualifying participants services received in exchange for the 

grant of equity instruments of the Group is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which is the 

period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied, and credited to share premium 

under equity.

For  grant  of  share  options,  the  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is  determined  by  reference  to  the  fair  value 

of the options granted by using option-pricing models - Black-Scholes valuation model (the “BS Model”) 

and  “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the  “Binomial  Model”),  which  include  the  impact  of  market 

performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) but exclude the impact of service condition 

and  non-market  performance  conditions.  For  grant  of  award  shares,  the  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is 

determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date. The Group  also 

adopts valuation technique to assess the fair value of other equity instruments of the Group granted under 

the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation  expenses,  which  are  recognised  in  the  financial  statement,  are  treated  as  part  of  the 

“Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

At each reporting period end, the Group revise their estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. They recognise the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in 

the consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the 

remaining vesting period.

2.29 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

If the Group repurchases vested equity instruments, the payment made to the employee and other qualifying 

participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  payment 

exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such 

excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

2.30 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 

the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.31 Revenue recognition

The Group principally derives revenues from provision of VAS and online advertising services in the PRC.

(a)  VAS

Revenues from VAS are derived principally from the provision of online/mobile games, community value-

added services and applications across various Internet and mobile platforms.

The VAS can be paid directly by end users by way of online payment channels or utilising the prepaid cards 

and tokens (represented a specific amount of payment unit) issued by the Group. In addition, certain VAS 

are paid through various third parties platforms.

The Group sells the prepaid credits through various channels such as sales agents appointed by the Group, 

telecommunication operators, third party platform providers, broadband service providers and Internet cafes, 

etc. The end users can register the prepaid credits to their user accounts in the Group’s platforms and then 

gain access to the Group’s paid online products or services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid credits are 

deferred and recorded as “Deferred revenue” in the consolidated statement of financial position (see Note 

36).

Revenue  is  recognised  from  the  sales  of  online  services  when  the  services  are  rendered.  Revenue  is 

recognised  from  the  virtual  products/items  in  the  Group’s  Internet/mobile  platforms  over  the  estimated 

lifespan of the respective virtual products/items. The estimated lifespan of different virtual products/items 

are determined by the management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated 

period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items depending on the respective term of virtual products/

items.

In respect of the Group’s VAS services directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various 

third parties platforms, these third party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Internet and Mobile 

Service Fees”) on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of commission 

fee (defined as “Channel costs”). The Channel costs are withheld and deducted from the gross Internet and 

Mobile Service Fees collected by these platforms from the users, with the net amounts remitted to the Group. 

The  Group  recognises  the  Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees  as  revenue  on  a  gross  basis,  given  it  is  the 

principal in these transactions, and recognises the Channel costs as cost of revenues.

2.31 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

The Group also opens its Internet and mobile platforms to third-party game/application developers under 

certain co-operation agreements, of which the Group pays a pre-determined percentage of the fees  paid 

by and collected from the users of the Group’s Internet and mobile platforms for the virtual products/items 

purchased to the third-party game/application developers. The Group recognises the related revenue on a 

gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. 

The Group also defers the related revenue, either on gross or net basis, over the estimated lifespan of the 

respective  virtual  products/items,  given  there  is  an  implicit  obligation  of  the  Group  to  maintain  and  allow 

access of the users of the games/applications operated by the developers through its platforms.

Determining  whether  revenue  of  the  Group  should  be  reported  gross  or  net  is  based  on  a  continuing 

assessment of various factors. The primary factor is whether the Group acting as the principal in offering 

services to the customer or as an agent in the transaction. The Group has determined that it is acting as 

the principal in offering services wherever the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has 

latitude in establishing the selling price; (iii) has discretion in suppliers selection; and (iv) has involvement 

in the determination of product or services specifications. The Group adopted different revenue recognition 

methods based on its specific responsibilities/obligations in different VAS offerings.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from performance based and display based 

advertisements.

Revenue from performance based advertisements is recognised based on actual performance measurement. 

The  Group  recognises  the  revenue  from  the  delivery  of  pay-for  click,  pay-for  download  or  pay-for  instant 

display advertisements for advertisers to users of the Group based on the relevant performance measures.

Revenue from displaying advertisements is recognised ratably over the respective contract periods with the 

advertisers and their advertising agencies, when the related advertisements are displayed.

Commissions payable to advertising agencies are recognised as a component of the cost of revenues.

2.32 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

2.33 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

2.34 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.35 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.36 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate.

2.37 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criterias are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency  exposures,  primarily  with  respect  to  RMB,  Hong  Kong  Dollars  (“HKD”),  USD  and  Euro 

(“EUR”). Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

entities.  The  functional  currency  of  the  Company  and  majority  of  its  overseas  subsidiaries  is  USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures through natural hedges, wherever possible, 

and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, when necessary.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (Cont’d)

At 31 December 2016, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange rates 

of the above currencies against the two major functional currencies of the Group’s entities would not 

result in a significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and 

liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective Group’s entities’ function currency are 

considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange 

risk (2015: Nil).

(ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk mainly arising from investments that are classified as available-

for-sale  financial  assets  held  by  the  Group  (Note  23).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from  the 

investments,  the  Group  diversifies  its  portfolio.  The  investments  made  by  the  Group  are  either  for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity analysis is performed by management to assess the exposure of the Group’s financial results 

to equity price risks of available-for-sale financial assets at the end of each of the reporting period. If 

equity prices of the respective instruments held by the Group had been 5% (2015: 5%) higher/lower 

as at 31 December 2016, the other comprehensive income would have been approximately RMB3,879 

million (2015: RMB2,067 million) higher/lower.

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loan to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 24, 27 and 29.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable,  details  of  which  have  been  disclosed  in  Notes  33  and  34,  which  representing  substantial 

portion of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group 

to  cash  flow  interest-rate  risk  whereas  those  carried  at  fixed  rates  expose  the  Group  to  fair  value 

interest-rate risk.

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (Cont’d)

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts 

to hedge its exposure arising from its borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate 

swap  contracts,  the  Group  agreed  with  the  counterparties  to  exchange,  at  specified  interval,  the 

difference  between  fixed  contract  rates  and  floating-rate  interest  amounts  calculated  by  reference 

to  the  agreed  notional  amounts.  These  interest  rate  swap  contracts  have  the  economic  effect  of 

converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified as hedging accounting. The 

Group’s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2016 have been detailed in Note 

25.

At 31 December 2016 and 2015, management considers that any reasonable changes in the interest 

rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as Group’s exposure to cash flow 

interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after considering 

the effect of hedging are considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented 

for interest rate risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, other debt investments, as well as accounts and other receivables. The carrying amount of each 

class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the  Group’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  the 

corresponding class of financial assets. To manage this risk, deposits are mainly placed with state-owned 

financial institutions in the PRC and reputable international financial institutions outside of the PRC. There 

has been no recent history of default in relation to these financial institutions.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues of on credit terms are made to counterparties with 

an appropriate credit history and the management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties.

The Group’s online advertising that are sales to/through advertising agencies or directly to the advertisers at 

term of full advances, partial advances or sales on credit according to the Group’s credit policies. The credit 

period granted to the customers is usually not more than 90 days and the credit quality of these customers 

are assessed, which takes into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions 

are  made  for  past  due  balances  when  management  considers  the  loss  from  the  customers  is  likely.  The 

Group’s historical experience in collection of receivables falls within the recorded allowances.

The  Group’s  revenues  from  VAS  are  generally  paid  by  end  users  by  way  of  online  payment  channels  or 

utilising  the  prepaid  cards  and  tokens  issued  and  sold  by  the  Group,  whereas  the  revenue  from  VAS 

that  delivered  to  its  end  users  through  third  party  platforms  were  collected  by  these  third  party  platform 

providers and remitted to the Group under a credit period of 30 to 120 days. In addition, the Group also 

sold  prepaid  credits  through  various  channels  such  as  sales  agents,  telecommunication  operators,  third 

party platform providers and Internet cafes, etc. Apart from a credit period of 30 to 120 days granted to the 

telecommunication  operators  and  third  party  platform  providers,  full  advances  were  required  from  other 

channels.

In  view  of  the  history  of  co-operation  with  these  third  party  platform  providers  and  telecommunication 

operators,  and  the  sound  financial  position  and  collection  history  of  receivables  due  from  these 

counterparties,  management  believes  that  the  credit  risk  inherent  in  the  Group’s  outstanding  accounts 

receivable balances from these counterparties is low (see Note 28 for details).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital referred to the equity and external debts (including borrowings and notes payable). In order to maintain or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The Group monitors capital by regularly reviewing debts to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 

amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflecting 

financial health and liquidity position. The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts 

by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2016 by level of 

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

• 

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

• 

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, an available-for-sale financial asset was transferred from level 2 to level 

1 of fair value hierarchy classifications.

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

Valuation processes of the Group (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who perform valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting 

purposes. The team performs valuation, or necessary updates, at least once every quarter, which coincide with the 

Group’s quarterly reporting dates. On an annual basis, the team adopts various valuation techniques to determine 

the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and consulted 

when it is necessary.

The components of the level 3 instruments mainly include investments in private investment funds and unlisted 

companies, other financial instruments and convertible bonds. As these instruments are not traded in an active 

market, their fair values have been determined using various applicable valuation techniques, including discounted 

cash flows, comparable transactions approaches, and other option pricing models etc. Major assumptions used 

in the valuation include historical financial results, assumptions about future growth rates, estimate of weighted 

average cost of capital (WACC), recent market transactions, discount for lack of marketability and other exposure 

etc. Other financial liabilities included guarantee provided by the Group on certain put arrangements of an investee 

company and put options issued by the Group to certain investors of an investee company, at a pre-determined 

pricing  formula.  The  fair  values  of  these  instruments  determined  by  the  Group  requires  significant  judgement, 

including  the  likelihood  of  non-performing  by  the  investee  company,  financial  performance  of  the  investee 

company, market value of comparable companies as well as discount rate, etc.

156

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 20164 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The  estimates  of  the  lifespan  of  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s  Internet  and  mobile 

platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.31(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s 

Internet and mobile platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the estimated lifespan of the virtual 

products/items.  The  estimated  lifespan  of  different  virtual  products/items  are  determined  by  the  management 

based on either the expected users’ relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual 

products/items depending on the respective terms of virtual products/items.

Significant  judgements  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  included  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption pattern, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespan 

of  virtual  products/items  on  a  regular  basis  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of  change  in  the  expected  users’ 

relationship periods.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespan of the virtual products/items. The results may differ from 

the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different 

basis than in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets and investments in redeemable instruments of associates

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, and investments in associates and joint ventures, as well as investments in redeemable 

instruments of associates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-

use calculations or fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgment is required to identify any impairment indicators existed for any of the Group’s goodwill and non-financial 

assets, to determine appropriate impairment approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value in use, for 

impairment reviews purpose, and to select key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, including 

discounted cash flows and market approach. Changing the assumptions selected by management in assessing 

impairment could materially affect the result of the impairment test and as a result affect the Group’s financial 

condition and results of operations. If there is a significant adverse change in the key assumptions applied, it may 

be necessary to take additional impairment charge to the consolidated income statement.

(c)  Fair value measurement of available-for-sale financial assets and other financial assets

The  fair  values  assessment  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  other  financial  assets  that  are  measured 

at  level  3  fair  value  hierarchy  required  significant  estimates,  which  includes  estimating  the  future  cash  flows, 

determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could 

materially affect the respective fair value of these investments. The Group monitors its investments for impairment 

by considering factors including, but not limited to, current economic and market conditions, recent fund raising 

transactions undertaken by the investees, the operating performance of the investees including current earnings 

trends and other company-specific information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Classification of investments

The Group made certain significant amounts of investments that involved complex terms and arrangements, and 

in different forms of financial instruments during the year. Judgement is required in determining the appropriate 

classification for these investments including assessing the relevant activities of the investee companies and its 

decisions making process on those activities that involving the Group, if any and its other investors, the rights and 

power of the Group and other investors on the investee companies, any other arrangements or transactions among 

the Group, its other investors and/or the investee companies, and the Group’s returns from the investments.

Different  conclusions  around  these  judgements  may  materially  impact  how  these  investments  presented  and 

measured in the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group.

(e)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.29(c),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants. The directors have adopted the dividend adjusted Black-Scholes option pricing model and “Enhanced 

FAS 123” binomial model (“Valuation Models”) to determine the total fair value of the options granted, which is 

to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant judgement on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the Valuation Models (Note 

32).

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Valuation Models was approximately HKD668 million (equivalent to approximately RMB560 million) in 2016 (2015: 

HKD76 million (equivalent to approximately RMB60 million)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2016, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

88%-96% (2015: 85%-97%).

159

Annual Report 2016Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 20164 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(e)  Share-based compensation arrangements (Cont’d)

If the Expected Retention Rate had been increased/decreased by 5% (2015: 5%), the amount of share-based 

compensation expenses would be increased/decreased by RMB230 million (2015: RMB154 million).

In addition, during the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group repurchased certain vested equity interests in a 

non-wholly owned subsidiary and exchanged certain unvested equity interests in a non-wholly owned subsidiary for 

the unvested awarded shares of the Company, which have been accounted for as shareholders’ transactions with 

gain or loss reflected within equity.

(f) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining 

the worldwide provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on 

estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from 

the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax 

liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

Were the actual final outcome (on the judgement areas) to differ by 5% from management’s estimates, the Group 

would need to:

‧ 

Increase the income tax liabilities by RMB261 million (2015: RMB80 million) and the deferred tax liabilities 

by RMB258 million (2015: RMB183 million), if unfavourable; or

‧  Decrease the income tax liabilities by RMB261 million (2015: RMB80 million) and the deferred tax liabilities 

by RMB258 million (2015: RMB183 million), if favourable.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The chief operating decision-makers mainly include executive directors of the Company. They review the Group’s internal 

reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and determine the operating segments based on these 

reports.

The Group has following reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015:

–  

VAS;

–  

Online advertising; and

–  

Others.

“Others” segment of the Group primarily comprises payment related services, cloud services and other services.

The  chief  operating  decision-makers  assess  the  performance  of  the  operating  segments  mainly  based  on  segment 

revenue and gross profit of each operating segment. The selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative 

expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore they are not included in the 

measure of the segments’ performance which is used by the chief operating decision-makers as a basis for the purpose 

of  resource  allocation  and  assessment  of  segment  performance.  Interest  income,  other  gains/(losses),  net,  finance 

income/(costs), net and income tax expense are also not allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015. The revenues from 

external  customers  reported  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  are  measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that 

applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other information, together with the segment information, provided to the chief operating decision-makers, is measured 

in a manner consistent with that applied in these consolidated financial statements. There were no segment assets and 

segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

(iii)  PRC corporate income tax (Cont’d)

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Company are entitled to other tax concessions and they are exempt from corporate income tax for two years, 

followed by a 50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the next three years, commencing either from 

the first year of commercial operation or from the first year of profitable operation, after offsetting tax losses 

generated in prior years.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other countries

South America has been calculated on the estimated assessable profits for the year at the rates prevailing in

12  EARNINGS PER SHARE (Cont’d)

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates, and the convertible bonds of the subsidiaries should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. 

During  the  years  ended  31  December  2016  and  2015,  these  share  options,  restricted  shares  and  convertible 

bonds had either anti-dilutive effect or insignificant dilutive effect to the Group.

Note:

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the 

subsidiaries in the PRC participate in employee social security plans established in the PRC, which cover pension, medical and other 

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 are listed

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

During the year ended 31 December 2016, amortisation of RMB8,277 million (2015: RMB3,068 million) and RMB653 

million (2015: RMB408 million) were charged to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses, respectively.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of certain subsidiaries have 

been impaired to the extent of RMB366 million (Note 7) as a result of significant decline in revenues and unsatisfactory 

operating performance of these subsidiaries.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs and most of the goodwill is related to the VAS. The recoverable amount of a 

CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The key assumptions used for the calculations of the 

recoverable amounts of major CGUs are as follows:

For online game business, management calculates the fair value less costs to sell based on ratios of EV (enterprise value) 

divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of several comparable public companies 

multiplied by the EBITDA (ranging within 10-18x) of the related CGU and discounted for the lack of marketability at 

a range of 10% to 20%. The comparable public companies are chosen based on factors such as industry similarity, 

company size, profitability and financial risks.

For online literature business and online music business, management calculates value-in-use based on discounted 

cash flows calculations. The discounted cash flows calculations use cash flow projections developed based on financial 

budgets approved by management of the Group covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are 

extrapolated using an estimated annual growth of not more than 5%. Pre-tax discount rates of 20% to 25% adopted for 

the online music business and the online literature business, respectively, which reflects market assessments of time 

value and the specific risks relating to the industry that the Group operates. The financial projections were determined by 

the management based on past performance and its expectation for market development.

Supercell Financing and the Consortium acquired 76.9% interest in Supercell.

The  Group’s  investment  in  the  Consortium  was  accounted  for  as  compound  financial  instruments  with  the  host  component 
(substantially equity) recognised as available-for-sale financial assets of RMB18,985 million and embedded derivative recognised 

as other financial assets of RMB1,176 million (Note 25).

stocks of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”), a listed company in US which is principally engaged in the development and sales of electric 
vehicles, sustainable energy generation and storage equipment.

Subsequently, the Group acquired additional common stocks of Tesla and its aggregate equity interest in Tesla amounted to

RMB11,057 million in unlisted entities mainly operated in the PRC and the United States. These companies are engaged in 

technology, online-to-offline and other Internet-related services.

(iv) 

Fair value gains of RMB2,567 million (2015: RMB13,045 million) were recognised in other comprehensive income during the 

year ended 31 December 2016 as a result of the remeasurement of the changes in fair values of the available-for-sale financial 

assets as at 31 December 2016.

(v) 

The Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB1,028 million (2015: RMB586 million) against the carrying amounts 

of certain available-for-sale financial assets during the year ended 31 December 2016, with reference to their assessed fair values 

as at 31 December 2016.

(vi) 

As at 31 December 2016, the balance of the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets comprise of a large number of individual

Approximately RMB28,154 million (2015: RMB22,150 million) and RMB1,856 million (2015: RMB6,995 million) 

of the total balance of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents was denominated in RMB, which had been placed 

with banks in Mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively.

(b)  Restricted cash

As at 31 December 2016, restricted deposits held at bank of RMB750 million (2015: RMB54,731 million) were 

mainly denominated in RMB.

As at 31 December 2015, the cash amount deposited with banks under users’ entrustment (the “Entrustment 

Value”) had been presented and recognised as “Restricted cash” under current assets with corresponding liability 

in equivalent amount as “Other payables and accruals” (Note 38) under current liabilities.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, in light of changes in operating environment in the PRC, and based on 

the advice of the Company’s legal advisor, the Group has formed a view that it holds the Entrustment Value as a 

custodian and the Group has amended its relevant users’ agreements to reflect such effect. Accordingly, the Group 

has no longer recognised the Entrustment Value since 2 July 2016, being the effective date of amendments to the 

users’ agreements. The Entrustment Value amounted to approximately RMB125 billion on 2 July 2016.

31  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with limited liabilities in the PRC, appropriation of net profits (after offsetting accumulated losses from prior years) should be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profits (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 32(d)).

(d) 

During the year, the Group has acquired non-controlling interests in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries and the aggregate net 

excess of considerations over the carrying amounts of acquired non-controlling interests of RMB2,523 million (2015: RMB8,160 

million) was recognised directly in equity. Out of which includes an agreement to entire non-controlling interests (including the 

outstanding equity-settled and cash-settled share options and restricted shares under the relevant employees incentive plans) in 

a non-wholly owned subsidiary entered into by the Group in 2015. The considerations were settled in cash and awarded shares 

of the Company. This acquisition was partially completed in 2015 and 2016.

204

32  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted four share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II and the Post-IPO Option Scheme III.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme and the Post-IPO Option Scheme I expired on 31 December 2011 and 23 March 

2014 respectively.

In  respect  of  the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  II  and  the  Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  III,  the  Board  may,  at  their 

discretion, grant options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms 

and conditions stipulated therein. The exercise price must be in compliance with the requirement under The Rules 

Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange. In addition, the option vesting period is determined 

by the Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year or 10-year period after the date of grant of 

option.

32  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(a)  Share option schemes (Cont’d)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Valuation Models to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2016 was HKD56.41 per share (equivalent 

to approximately RMB47.33 per share) (2015: HKD51.92 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB41.01 

per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, are required to be made by the directors in applying the Valuation 

Models, which are summarised as below.

(b)  Share award schemes

The  Company  has  adopted  two  share  award  schemes  (the  “Share  Award  Schemes”),  both  of  which  are 

administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group (the “Trustee”) as of 31 December 2016. The 

vesting period of the awarded shares is determined by the Board.

executive directors of the Company).

32  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Share award schemes (Cont’d)

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2016  was 

HKD165.25  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB141.89  per  share)  (2015:  HKD147.94  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB120.86 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2016 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from four 

months to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

(c)  Employee incentive schemes

For aligning the interests of key employees with the Group, the Group established five employees’ investment plans 

in the form of limited liability partnerships in 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2016 (the “EIS”) respectively. According to 

the term of the EISs, the Board may, at its absolute discretion, select any employee of the Group, excluding any 

director of the Company, to participate in the EISs by subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. 

The participating employees are entitled to all the economic benefits generated by the EISs, if any, after a specified 

vesting period under the respective EISs, ranging from up to four to seven years. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of 

the Company act as general partner of these EISs administer and in essence, control the EISs. These EISs are 

therefore consolidated by the Company as structured entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 were 

insignificant to the Group.

210

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 201632  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion. Similar to the 

share option/award schemes adopted by the Company, the share options or restricted shares of the subsidiaries 

granted are normally vested by several tranches. Participants of some subsidiaries have the right to request the 

Group to repurchase their vested equity interests of the respective subsidiaries (“Repurchase Transaction”). The 

Group has discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Company or 

by cash. For the Repurchase Transaction which the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company 

are currently of the view that they would be settled by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are 

accounted for using the equity-settled share-based payment method.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2016, the Expected Retention Rate from the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

88%-96% (2015: 85%-97%).

39  CMC INTEGRATION

On 12 July 2016, the Group completed the integration of its online music business with CMC, a then existing associate of 

the Group which also operates online music business in the PRC. The Group injected its online music related operating 

assets and liabilities (the “Group’s Online Music Business”) into CMC in exchange for CMC’s new ordinary shares (the 

“CMC Integration”). Upon completion of the CMC Integration, the Group’s then prevailing 15.8% ordinary shares in CMC 

(“Previously Held Interest”) was derecognised as a deemed disposal and CMC became a non-wholly owned subsidiary in 

which the Group owns 61.6% of the issued and outstanding shares.

As a result of the CMC Integration, the Group is expected to increase its presence in online music industry in China. 

Goodwill arising from the CMC Integration was attributable to operating synergies and economies of scale expected from 

integrating the operations of the Group’s Online Music Business with CMC. The goodwill recognised was not expected to 

be deductible for income tax purpose.

The following table summarises the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the non-controlling interest 

recognised, on a provisional basis, as a result of the CMC Integration at the completion date.

39  CMC INTEGRATION (Cont’d)

The fair value of the non-controlling interest in CMC was estimated by making reference to the above consideration of the 

CMC Integration. This consideration was adjusted for control premium and lack of marketability that market participants 

would consider when estimating the fair value of the non-controlling interest in CMC.

Transaction costs of CMC Integration were not significant and were charged to general and administrative expenses in 

the consolidated income statement during the year ended 31 December 2016.

The revenue and the results contributed by CMC to the Group for the period since the completion date were insignificant. 

The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different should the CMC Integration otherwise 

occur on 1 January 2016.

The Group recognised a deemed disposal gain of RMB1,505 million recorded as “Other gains, net” during the  year 

ended 31 December 2016, being the difference between the fair value of the Previously Held Interest in CMC as at the 

completion date and its then carrying value (Note 7).

40  OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group also acquired certain insignificant subsidiaries. The aggregate 

considerations  for  these  acquisitions  was  RMB314  million,  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  (including  identifiable 

intangible assets), non-controlling interests and goodwill recognised were RMB291 million, RMB95 million and RMB118 

million, respectively.

The acquisition related costs of the business combinations were not significant and had been charged to general and 

administrative expenses during the year ended 31 December 2016.

The  revenue  and  the  results  contributed  by  these  acquired  entities  for  the  period  since  respective  acquisition  dates 

were insignificant to the Group. The Group’s revenue and results for the year would not be materially different if these 

acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2016.

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non-wholly owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(c) 

All subsidiaries’ undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings 

held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company further does 

not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As at 31 December 2016, cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB86,250 

million were held in Mainland China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and treasury regulations. 

The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment of dividends, share 

repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 32(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 30(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award schemes 

  which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Company contributed approximately RMB1,936 million (2015: RMB652 million) 

to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
