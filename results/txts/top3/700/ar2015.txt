Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

In  2014,  the  mobile  Internet  reshaped  the  Internet  industry  with  rapid  development  of  mobile  game  and  entertainment 

activities,  enhanced  importance  of  mobile  advertising,  growing  adoption  of  mobile  payment  and  the  emergence  of  O2O 

opportunities. The mobile game population grew as many smart phone users, including some who were previously not PC 

client  game  players,  began  playing  casual  or  mid-core  games.  Mobile  video  and  music  became  popular  as  users  sought 

entertainment on-the-go. Mobile social advertising increased as advertisers incorporated social data for targeted advertising. 

Mobile payment adoption expanded significantly as a result of increased smart phone penetration, advanced mobile payment 

technologies and aggressive promotion efforts by leading Internet companies. The mobile Internet enabled an upsurge in O2O 

transactions across industry verticals such as restaurants, transportation and household services.

Market  competition  remained  intense  as  major  industry  participants  invested  aggressively  in  areas  including:  (1)  popular 

mobile applications, such as mobile utilities, mobile payment and O2O services; (2) digital content, such as online music and 

video copyrights; and (3) offline industries moving online, such as finance and healthcare.

Overall Financial Performance

Year Ended 31 December 2014

In  2014,  revenues  increased  by  31%  to  RMB78,932  million.  Excluding  the  eCommerce  transactions  business,  revenues 

increased by 46% to RMB74,179 million.

—  VAS. Revenues from our VAS business increased by 41% to RMB63,310 million. Our online game business achieved 

healthy growth in revenues, mainly driven by PC client games and smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and 

Weixin. Our social networks revenues grew significantly, driven by increased in-game item sales on mobile platforms. 

Subscription services also registered renewed revenue growth.

—  Online advertising. Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 65% to RMB8,308 million, primarily 

driven  by  video  advertising  and  performance-based  social  advertising  on  mobile.  Video  advertising  benefited  from 

underlying viewer growth. The growth in performance-based social advertising on mobile was mainly driven by Mobile 

Qzone and Weixin Official Accounts. Our strategic co-operation with JD.com also contributed to the growth of our online 

advertising business.

—  eCommerce transactions.  Revenues  from  our  eCommerce  transactions  business  decreased  by  51%  to  RMB4,753 

million. The decline mainly reflected a traffic shift to JD.com following our strategic transaction with JD.com in March 

2014, and the repositioning of our Yixun business from principal to marketplace operations.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 54% to RMB23,810 million. Non-GAAP profit attributable to 

equity holders of the Company increased by 43% to RMB24,224 million.

Annual Report 2014Chairman’s StatementFourth Quarter of 2014

In the fourth quarter of 2014, revenues increased by 24% year-on-year to RMB20,978 million. Excluding the eCommerce 

transactions business, revenues increased by 50% year-on-year to RMB20,532 million.

—  VAS. Revenues from our VAS business increased by 44% year-on-year to RMB17,137 million. Our online game business 

achieved healthy growth in revenues, mainly driven by PC client games and smart phone games integrated with Mobile 

QQ and Weixin. Our gross revenues generated from smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin amounted 

to approximately RMB3.8 billion. Our social networks revenues grew significantly, reflecting increased in-game item sales 

on mobile platforms and revenue growth in subscription services.

—  Online advertising. Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 75% year-on-year to RMB2,627 million. 

The increase primarily flowed from video advertising and performance-based social advertising on mobile.

—  eCommerce transactions.  Revenues  from  our  eCommerce  transactions  business  decreased  by  87%  year-on-year  to 

RMB446 million. The decline mainly reflected the traffic shift to JD.com and the repositioning of our Yixun business 

discussed above.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 50% year-on-year to RMB5,860 million. Non-GAAP profit 

attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 51% year-on-year to RMB6,723 million.

Strategic Highlights

In 2014, we focused on our “Connection” strategy, linking our users with content, services and hardware to enhance their 

lives online and offline. Leveraging our core communications and social platforms, Weixin and Mobile QQ, we made significant 

progress  in  fostering  a  healthy  mobile  ecosystem  which  provides  our  users  with  an  expanding  range  of  products  and 

services, taking advantage of our strengths such as unified login, users’ social graphs, multi-platform marketing capabilities, 

infrastructure support, payment solutions and insights into user needs.

During the year, we moved forward in monetising mobile Internet use, initially through smart phone games and performance-

based  social  advertising.  We  invested  heavily  in  content  for  businesses  such  as  our  literature  service,  music  service,  and 

video service, contributing to substantial traffic growth. Our portfolio of mobile utilities, including mobile security, browser and 

application store, achieved healthy market share gains. For example, YingYongBao became one of China’s leading Android 

application stores. We significantly expanded the user bases of our mobile payment platforms and we explored Internet finance 

opportunities with the launch of our wealth management platform and the inception of our bank affiliate, WeBank.

6

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementTo  complement  our  internal  initiatives,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  transaction  with  JD.com  to  reposition  our  eCommerce 

business, and we continued to enrich our ecosystem by making strategic investments in and partnering with industry leaders, 

including 58.com, Dianping, Dididache and Koudai Gouwu.

— 

From consumers’ perspective, we believe these and other partnerships enable our users to benefit from an expanding 

range of high quality products and services.

— 

From partners’ perspective, we believe our user activity is starting to contribute materially to our partners’ long-term 

growth. For example, we believe we direct substantial volumes of traffic from our platforms to JD.com and 58.com.

— 

From our perspective, partnerships free up our internal resources to focus on the core strengths of our platforms, while 

enabling us to continue to benefit financially from the growth potential of the underlying industries via our significant 

equity stakes in partners.

In terms of balance sheet management, we established a USD5 billion global medium term note programme in April 2014 

and subsequently issued various tranches of senior notes, with an aggregate principal amount of USD4.9 billion at the end of 

February 2015. We received a credit ratings upgrade from Moody’s on our issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings from Baa1 

to A3 in March 2014.

Annual Report 2014Chairman’s StatementKey Platforms

In 2014, QQ and Qzone benefited from significant growth in China’s mobile user base, and consolidated their leading positions 

in communications and social networking.

— 

For  QQ,  smart  device  MAU  increased  by  33%  year-on-year  to  576  million  at  the  end  of  2014,  while  overall  PCU 

increased by 21% year-on-year to 217 million. During the year, we enhanced user engagement on Mobile QQ as we 

improved its community and sharing functions. We also cultivated an ecosystem for Mobile QQ users by integrating with 

O2O and other new services, including those provided by our strategic partners, and introducing Mobile QQ Wallet.

— 

For  Qzone,  smart  device  MAU  increased  by  30%  year-on-year  to  540  million  at  the  end  of  2014.  User  activity  and 

stickiness improved during the year, benefiting from enhanced features and improved user experience.

Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat reached 500 million at the end of 2014, representing year-on-year growth of 41%.

— 

For  Weixin,  we  strengthened  user  interaction  and  engagement  with  new  features  and  services,  and  increased  the 

adoption of Weixin Official Accounts.

— 

For  WeChat,  we  continued  to  promote  user  engagement  in  selected  overseas  markets,  especially  emerging  Asian 

markets.

The aggregate number of user accounts that have integrated bank cards with Mobile QQ Wallet and Weixin Payment exceeded 

100 million as we enriched payment scenarios and launched initiatives to build user awareness and habit, such as Red Packet 

gifting.

Our online media platforms extended their leadership in China. Tencent News leveraged enhanced content, improved user 

experience and plug-ins to Mobile QQ and Weixin to achieve significant user growth and became the leading mobile news 

platform in China. Tencent Video improved its market position with a strong uplift in user base and traffic, thanks to enriched 

content and improved user experience.

8

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementVAS

In social networks, our business benefited from significant growth in in-game item sales on our mobile platforms, and higher 

subscription revenues as we enhanced the mobile privileges and mobile user experience for QQ Membership, Super VIP and 

Qzone subscription service. We also added more premium content for our literature, music and video subscription services.

In online games, we extended our leadership in the China market from PC to mobile.

— 

For PC client games, revenue increased in 2014 as we benefited from growth in major titles and launch of new titles. LoL 

delivered a robust performance with significant growth in users and revenues.

— 

For mobile games, we achieved strong revenue growth during 2014, becoming the largest publisher in China and one 

of the largest globally. Through the year, we diversified our portfolio of smart phone games from casual to mid-core and 

self-developed to third-party, enriching the choices available to users.

Looking ahead, we aim to diversify and capitalise on our strong title pipeline for PC and mobile games to penetrate into new 

genres and solidify our market leadership.

Online Advertising

In 2014, our online advertising business benefited from revenue growth across the brand display and performance display 

categories. During the year, video advertising registered a robust revenue increase due to viewer traffic growth, including traffic 

arising from the Voice of China 3 program and FIFA World Cup content. We made significant progress in mobile advertising 

on  Mobile  Qzone  and  Weixin  Official  Accounts.  Looking  forward,  we  aim  to  allocate  more  inventory  toward  performance 

advertising, including inventory on Weixin Moments and YingYongBao. We continue to invest aggressively in video content to 

further build our traffic, including our recent exclusive partnerships with HBO and NBA.

eCommerce Transactions

Our eCommerce transaction business underwent a strategy transition subsequent to our strategic transaction with JD.com 

in March 2014. Shifting our traffic to JD.com led to a substantial reduction in our eCommerce revenues, costs, and losses. 

Looking  forward,  we  believe  the  strategy  transition  enables  us  to  benefit  more  efficiently  from  the  growth  of  eCommerce 

in  China  via  our  significant  equity  stakes  in  best-in-class  eCommerce  companies  such  as  JD.com,  and  via  generating 

performance-based advertising revenues from eCommerce advertisers.

9

Annual Report 2014Chairman’s StatementOutlook and Strategies for 2015

During  2015,  in  addition  to  developing  our  ongoing  businesses,  we  intend  to  cultivate  an  increasingly  vibrant  mobile 

ecosystem,  bringing  our  own  and  our  partners’  products  and  services  to  China  consumers.  Key  aspects  of  cultivating  this 

ecosystem include:

—  Working  with  existing  and  prospective  strategic  partners  in  various  verticals  to  deliver  better  O2O  and  transactional 

services to users;

—  Developing our digital content businesses in partnership with key content providers, such as online literature authors, 

HBO, NBA, Sony Music, Warner Music, and YG Entertainment;

—  Growing our performance-based advertising business by adding more mobile advertising inventory, enhancing advertiser 

tools, and expanding our advertiser base, all while balancing user experience; and

— 

Promoting use of our payment services through enriched payment scenarios.

DIVIDEND

The  Board  has  recommended  the  payment  of  a  final  dividend  of  HKD0.36  per  share  (2013:  HKD1.20  per  share  before 

the effect of the Share Subdivision, or HKD0.24 per share after the effect of the Share Subdivision) for the year ended 31 

December 2014, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the 2015 AGM. Such proposed dividend will be payable on 29 

May 2015 to the shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 20 May 2015.

APPRECIATION

On  behalf  of  the  Board,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  shareholders  and  stakeholders  for  their  full  and  continued  confidence 

and  support.  I  also  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  our  committed  staff  at  every  level  and  management  team  for  their 

contributions in delivering the remarkable success. Looking ahead, we will continue to build a prosperous Internet ecosystem 

to enhance our users’ lives online and offline.

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementADOPTION OF GROSS REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR SMART PHONE GAMES

Starting from the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognise revenues from smart phone games on a gross basis, primarily to reflect 

changes in our co-operation models that resulted in us becoming the principal, rather than agent, for certain licensed games 

we publish on an exclusive basis. Correspondingly, we recorded revenue sharing with third-party developers and channel costs 

in costs of revenues, instead of treating them as contra-revenue items. For the fourth quarter of 2014, the change increased 

our revenues from smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin by RMB907 million, and related cost of revenues 

by the same amount. The change did not impact the Group’s profits. We believe the change brings us closer into line with 

general industry practice.

—  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 41% to RMB63,310 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 from 

the year ended 31 December 2013. Online games revenues increased by 40% to RMB44,756 million. The increase 

was mainly driven by revenue growth from PC client games in China and international markets, as well as a significant 

increase  in  revenues  from  smart  phone  games  integrated  with  Mobile  QQ  and  Weixin,  which  were  launched  during 

2013. Social networks revenues increased by 43% to RMB18,554 million. The increase was primarily driven by in-game 

item sales within mobile platforms and, to a lesser extent, by subscription revenues, which registered renewed growth 

due to the enhancement of our mobile privileges and mobile user experience for QQ Membership, Super VIP and Qzone 

subscription service.

Tencent Holdings LimitedManagement Discussion and Analysis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
—  Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 65% to RMB8,308 million for the year ended 31 December 

2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase mainly reflected: (1) revenue growth from video advertising 

due to more viewers; and (2) higher contributions from performance-based social advertising, especially on our mobile 

services  such  as  Mobile  Qzone  and  Weixin  Official  Accounts.  The  positive  impact  of  our  strategic  co-operation  with 

JD.com also contributed to the growth.

—  Revenues from our eCommerce transactions business decreased by 51% to RMB4,753 million for the year ended 31 

December 2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The decline mainly reflected a traffic shift to JD.com following 

our  strategic  transaction  with  JD.com  in  March  2014,  and  the  repositioning  of  our  Yixun  business  from  principal  to 

marketplace operations, resulting in a significant decline in revenues from principal eCommerce transactions.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 11% to RMB30,873 million for the year ended 31 December 2014  from 

the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase mainly reflected greater sharing and content costs, staff costs, as well as 

bandwidth and server custody fees, partially offset by a decline in cost of merchandise sold due to decreased revenues from 

principal eCommerce transactions. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 39% for the year ended 31 

December 2014 from 46% for the year ended 31 December 2013. Excluding the eCommerce transactions business, cost of 

revenues increased by 43% to RMB26,426 million. The following table sets forth our cost of revenues by line of business for

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  68%  to  RMB4,660  million  for  the  year  ended  31 

December 2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase primarily reflected greater investment in video 

content and the acceleration of video content costs amortisation since the fourth quarter of 2013. Commissions payable 

to advertising agencies and staff costs also increased.

— 

Cost of revenues for our eCommerce transactions business decreased by 52% to RMB4,447 million for the year ended 

31 December 2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The decrease was mainly driven by a decline in cost of 

merchandise sold due to lower revenues from principal eCommerce transactions.

Other gains, net.  Other  gains,  net  increased  to  RMB2,759  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2014  from  RMB904 

million for the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase primarily reflected: (1) an increase in net disposal gains related 

to investee companies and businesses mainly arising from our strategic transaction with JD.com and the sale of our equity 

interests in ChinaVision; and (2) the recognition of deemed disposal gains related to investee companies mainly arising from 

the merger of Kakao Corporation with a listed company, Daum Communications, and the IPO of JD.com. The increase was 

partly offset by higher impairment provision charges for selected investee companies.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 37% to RMB7,797 million for the year ended 

31 December 2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase was mainly due to significant subsidy programs for 

users and merchants of Weixin Payment, notably for booking taxi rides, as well as increased advertising spending on products 

and platforms such as online games, online media, and mobile utilities. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing 

expenses increased to 10% for the year ended 31 December 2014 from 9% for the year ended 31 December 2013.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 42% to RMB14,155 million for the 

year ended 31 December 2014 from the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher research 

and development expenses and staff costs. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 

18% for the year ended 31 December 2014 from 17% for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Finance costs, net. Finance costs, net increased to RMB1,182 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 from RMB84 

million for the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase mainly reflected the recognition of foreign exchange losses due to 

exchange rate movements in the year ended 31 December 2014, compared to foreign exchange gains in the previous year, as 

well as higher interest expense as a result of an increase in amount of notes payable.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by 38% to RMB5,125 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 from 

the year ended 31 December 2013. The increase primarily reflected higher profit before tax and an increase in deferred tax 

liabilities in respect of withholding taxes.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 54% 

to  RMB23,810  million  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2014  from  the  year  ended  31  December  2013.  Non-GAAP  profit 

attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 43% to RMB24,224 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 

from the year ended 31 December 2013.

Total revenues

—  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 44% to RMB17,137 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 from the fourth 

quarter of 2013. Online game revenues increased by 41% to RMB11,964 million. The increase was primarily driven 

by significant growth in revenues from smart phone games integrated with Mobile QQ and Weixin, mainly reflecting our 

expanded user base, our enriched game portfolio and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the aforementioned adoption of 

gross revenue recognition. Revenues from PC client games also increased. Social networks revenues grew by 50% to 

RMB5,173 million. The increase was mainly driven by higher in-game item sales within mobile platforms, as well as by 

subscription revenues from our QQ Membership, Super VIP, Qzone and digital content subscription services. If gross 

revenue recognition for smart phone games is adopted for the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues from our VAS business, 

online games, and social networks would have increased by 42%, 39% and 48% respectively for the fourth quarter of 

2014.

—  Revenues from our online advertising business increased by 75% to RMB2,627 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 

from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflected revenue growth in video advertising as a result of more 

viewers  and  enhanced  revenues  from  performance-based  social  advertising  on  mobile  driven  by  Mobile  Qzone  and 

Weixin Official Accounts.

—  Revenues  from  our  eCommerce  transactions  business  decreased  by  87%  to  RMB446  million  for  the  fourth  quarter 

of 2014 from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline mainly reflected a traffic shift to JD.com following our strategic 

transaction  with  JD.com  in  March  2014,  and  the  repositioning  of  our  Yixun  business  from  principal  to  marketplace 

operations.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 2% to RMB8,332 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 from the fourth quarter 

of 2013. The increase mainly reflected greater sharing and content costs, staff costs, as well as channel costs, largely offset 

by a significant decline in cost of merchandise sold due to decreased revenues from principal eCommerce transactions. As 

a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 40% for the fourth quarter of 2014 from 48% for the fourth quarter 

of  2013.  Excluding  the  eCommerce  transactions  business,  cost  of  revenues  increased  by  60%  to  RMB8,069  million.  The

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 1% to RMB2,063 million for the fourth quarter 

of 2014 from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase mainly reflected higher advertising spending on products and platforms 

such  as  Weixin  Payment  and  online  games,  partly  offset  by  decreases  in  promotional  expenses  related  to  WeChat,  and 

advertising and fulfillment expenses related to our eCommerce transactions business. As a percentage of revenues, selling and

Finance (costs)/income, net. We recorded finance costs, net of RMB273 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared 

to finance income, net of RMB6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. The change mainly reflected higher interest expense 

as a result of an increase in amount of notes payable and the recognition of foreign exchange losses due to exchange rate 

movements in the fourth quarter of 2014.

quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, deferred tax liabilities in respect of withholding taxes increased. In addition, 

reversals of income tax expense were recorded as a result of the qualification to enjoy lower CIT rates for certain subsidiaries in 

China.

to RMB5,860 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 from the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP profit attributable to equity

options into our titles. Revenues from PC client games were affected by slower seasonality in China. Social networks

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain non-GAAP financial measures, 

including  non-GAAP  operating  profit,  non-GAAP  operating  margin,  non-GAAP  profit  for  the  period,  non-GAAP  net  margin, 

non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, non-GAAP basic EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS, have been 

presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a 

substitute for, measures of the Company’s financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-

GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used by other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impact 

of M&A transactions. The following tables set forth the reconciliations of the Group’s non-GAAP financial measures for the 

years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, and the third quarter of 2014 to the nearest

As at 31 December 2014, the Group had net cash of RMB22,758 million. The sequential increase in net cash was primarily 

driven by free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by payments for investments in investee 

companies.  Fair  value  of  our  stakes  in  listed  investee  companies  (both  associates  and  available-for-sale  financial  assets) 

totalled RMB60 billion as at 31 December 2014.

As  at  31  December  2014,  RMB7,796  million  of  our  financial  resources  were  held  in  deposits  denominated  in  non-RMB 

currencies.

For the fourth quarter of 2014, the Group had free cash flow of RMB9,181 million. This was a result of net cash generated 

from operating activities of RMB10,679 million, offset by payments for capital expenditure of RMB1,498 million.

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ ReportMaintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board  views  effective  corporate  governance  practices  as  a  priority  of  the  Group,  with  the  aim  of  providing  our  investors  a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how the management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will recognise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will create trust with the public and ultimately create shareholder 

value for the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

The Board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company complied with the applicable code 

provisions set out in the CG Code, except for the deviation from code provisions A.2.1 regarding the segregation of the role of 

the chairman and chief executive and A.4.2 regarding the retirement and re-election of directors.

The Board continues to monitor and review the Company’s corporate governance practices and makes necessary changes at 

an appropriate time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Responsibilities

The Board’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise its best judgment and to act in the best interests of the Company and 

its shareholders. The Board oversees management’s efforts to promote the Company’s success while operating in an effective 

and responsible manner. The Board also formulates the Company’s overall business strategies and monitors management’s 

execution of such strategies.

By  discharging  its  responsibilities,  the  Board  has  defined  the  business  and  governance  issues  for  which  it  needs  to  be 

responsible, and these matters reserved for the Board have been separately defined, and are reviewed periodically, to ensure 

that the Company maintains the proper level of corporate governance and to ensure they are up to date. In this regard, the 

Board:

The Board delegates the responsibility of day-to-day business and operations to the Company’s senior management team, 

which includes its chief officers, the president and executive vice-presidents. The senior management team meets once every 

two weeks or as frequent as necessary to formulate policies and make recommendations to the Board. The senior management 

team administers, enforces, interprets and supervises compliance with the internal rules and operational procedures of the 

Company as well as its subsidiaries and conducts regular reviews, recommends and advises on appropriate amendments to 

such rules and procedures. The senior management team reports to the Board on a regular basis and communicates with the 

Board whenever required.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  dedicates  certain  matters  which  require  particular 

time, attention and expertise to be devoted to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt 

with by the committees as they require independent oversight and specialists input. As such, the Board has established five 

committees  to  assist  the  Board:  Audit  Committee,  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  Nomination 

Committee and Remuneration Committee. Each of the committees has terms of reference which clearly specifies its powers 

and authorities. All committees report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportAll directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring the Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expenses for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe ongoing education and training, as well as participation in director education programs, is important for maintaining 

a current and effective Board. In order to ensure the directors are aware of their responsibilities as directors of the Company, 

and for the Company to take advantage of their rich mix of knowledge and experience, it is our practice that new directors have 

to undergo an orientation programme and the existing directors have to attend a comprehensive, formal and tailored training 

on  their  duties  and  responsibilities  as  directors  under  statute,  common  law,  the  Listing  Rules,  legal  and  other  regulatory 

requirements provided by external professional advisers. Directors would also regularly meet with senior management team 

to  understand  the  Group’s  business,  governance  policies  and  regulatory  environment.  New  directors  would  also  receive  a 

directors’  handbook  on  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules,  applicable  legal  requirements  and  other  regulatory 

requirements and the business and governance policies of the Company. Trainings have been and will continue to be provided 

by external advisers on a regular basis in relation to any updates of laws and regulations (including the Listing Rules) which 

relate to the director’s responsibilities. During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company arranged a briefing on topics 

relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory environment and business trends which are relevant to the Group’s 

business on 13 August 2014. Below summarises each of the directors participation in continuous professional development 

during the year ended 31 December 2014:

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportMaintaining  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  integrity  cannot  depend  solely  on  the  Board’s  efforts,  each  of  the 

Group’s employees is also required to contribute to such cause. The Company thus distributes a code of conduct policy which 

emphasises on honesty and respect is distributed to all employees and forms part of their service contracts.

In  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and  in 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

review of the shareholders communication policy on a regular basis

trainings have been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and the laws

company secretary attends trainings in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements

informal updates and structured monthly updates on the Company’s performance, position and prospects are provided 

to the directors

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of Chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be proficient in IT knowledge and be sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in  order  to  promote  the  different  businesses  of  the  Group.  The  Board  thus  considers  that  a  segregation  of  the  role  of  the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time 

to make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board 

and committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly briefed 

at the Board meetings, and together with the senior management, provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete and reliable 

information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for 

discussion  for  all  items  at  the  Board  meetings.  During  the  year  ended  31  December  2014,  the  Chairman  held  a  meeting 

with the non-executive directors (including the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive 

directors, presenting diversified perspectives for the Chairman to consider.

61

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportThe  Board  is  therefore  of  the  view  that  there  are  adequate  balance  of  power  and  safeguards  in  place.  Nevertheless,  the 

Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary changes at an 

appropriate time.

Composition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board comprised a total of seven directors, with two executive directors, two non-

executive directors and three independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2014 and up to the 

date of this annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board except that Mr Zhang Zhidong has resigned as 

an executive director of the Company with effect from 20 March 2014.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 40 to 43 of this annual report.

In order for the Group to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspective and in order for the directors 

to ensure that they give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to 

the Company quarterly the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that the 

number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that the 

balance between the executive directors and non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient checks 

and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of independent judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in an independent, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings and to bring independent judgment and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, policies, performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the shareholders’ interests being the utmost important factor. The non-executive directors also exercise their independent 

judgment  and  utilise  their  expertise  to  scrutinise  the  Company’s  performance  in  achieving  agreed  corporate  goals  and 

objections, and monitor performance reporting.

Further, in compliance with Rule 3.10 of the Listing Rules, one of our independent non-executive directors has the appropriate 

professional qualifications or accounting or related financial management expertise, who provides valuable advice from time to 

time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation annually of 

his independence and the Nomination Committee has conducted an annual review and considers that all independent non-

executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing 

Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

62

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportAs part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

Appointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the right membership of the Board, we can benefit from the right set 

of skills, experience and diversity of perspective to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain the established formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 

It is our corporate governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the 

Chairman)  should  be  subject  to  re-election  at  regular  intervals  and  the  resignation  and  removal  of  any  director  should  be 

explained with reasons. In the 2014 annual general meeting, Mr Lau Chi Ping Martin and Mr Charles St Leger Searle were 

retired and re-elected.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

Since the Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by 

rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year, code provision A.4.2 of the CG 

Code is deviated. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and development 

of the Group. At present, the Chairman’s continuing presence in the Board is vital to assure sustainable development of the 

Group. Given the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the relevant 

provision in the Articles of Association has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

63

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportBoard Activity

The Board meets four times during the year as a minimum and, during the year of 2014, it met nine times. The attendance 

of  each  director  at  Board,  committee  meetings  and  annual  general  meeting,  whether  in  person  or  by  means  of  electronic 

communication, is detailed in the table below:

Mr Zhang Zhidong has resigned as an executive director of the Company with effect from 20 March 2014.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed on a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial 

and operational performances, approved the annual, interim and quarterly results of the Group, the appointments of director, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, in 

consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agendas for each meeting and all directors are 

given the opportunity to include matters for discussion in the agenda. The company secretary also ensures that all applicable 

rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the Board meeting 

to each of the director at least fourteen days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary also sends the 

agendas, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least three days in advance of 

each regular Board meeting and committee meetings, and to keep the directors updated on the Group’s financial performance 

and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as promptly and 

fully  as  possible.  If  there  is  potential  or  actual  conflicts  of  interests  involving  a  substantial  shareholder  or  a  director,  such 

director would declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 

senior management team when necessary. The directors may also retain independent professional advisers at the Company’s 

expense if necessary.

64

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  to  ensure  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. The directors receive the draft minutes for comments shortly after 

each meeting and final minutes with the relevant board papers and related materials are available for review and inspection by 

the directors at any time.

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportDuring 2014, the Nomination Committee reviewed board composition and director succession, and the board diversity policy. 

The Nomination Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive directors and considers all 

of them being independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules in the 

context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director. The Company recognises the benefits of having 

a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a business imperative that will help the Company achieve its strategic 

objectives and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, the Board has set measurable objectives for the implementation 

of  the  board  diversity  policy  to  ensure  that  the  Board  has  the  appropriate  balance  of  skills,  experience  and  diversity  of 

perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business strategy and in order for the Board to be effective. The

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong

The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2014. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is set 

out on page 64.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of each director.

During 2014, the Remuneration Committee:

‧ 

reviewed  and  recommended  to  the  Board  in  respect  of  the  remuneration  policies  and  structure  of  the  Company  by

contributions to the Company and to provide incentives for future performances

In conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured  that  no  individual  and  his  associates  were  involved  in  determining  his  own  remuneration.  It  also  ensured  that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned to 

the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategy. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

In  respect  of  non-executive  directors,  the  Remuneration  Committee  has  reviewed  fees  payable  taking  into  account  the 

particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

67

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportACCOUNTS, RISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects are presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position in sufficient detail, to give the directors a balanced, understandable 

and  informed  assessment  of  the  performance,  position  and  prospects  of  the  Group.  The  senior  management  team  also 

provides all necessary and relevant information to the Board, giving the directors sufficient explanation and information they 

need to discharge their responsibilities. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out 

in the Auditor’s Report.

The Board also has the responsibility to oversee the risks undertaken by the Group, and to actively consider, analyse and 

formulate strategies to control the risks the Group is exposed to, and determines the level of risk the Company wishes to and is 

able to take. The senior management team monitors these risks and develops effective systems and mechanisms to mitigate 

risks to an acceptable level as determined by the Board. The senior management team reports to the Board periodically and 

whenever necessary on the risks the Group faces and the actions taken to mitigate them.

An  adequate  and  effective  internal  control  system  is  key  to  mitigate  risk  and  to  safeguard  shareholders’  interests  and  the 

Group’s assets against any unauthorised use or disposition. The internal control system should also, among others, ensure the 

maintenance of proper accounting records for the provision of reliable financial information for internal use or for publication 

and to ensure that the Group is in compliance with relevant legislation and regulations.

The Board is responsible for overseeing sound risk management and internal control systems on an ongoing basis. The Board 

has established and maintained a set of procedures to provide effective risk management and internal control systems, which 

include:

‧ 

establishing a distinct organisation structure with defined lines of authority and control responsibilities. Relevant group, 

division or department heads actively participate in the preparation of strategic plans for achieving annual operational 

and financial targets. These plans serve as the foundation for the preparation of the Group’s annual budget by which 

resources are allocated in accordance with identified and prioritised business opportunities. The Board approves the 

annual operating plan and budget on an annual basis

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

if there are any variances against the annual budget, these variances will be analysed and appropriate actions will be 

taken if necessary to rectify or mitigate these deficiencies noted

IA performs independent review of the operational areas and presents its findings and prospective audit plan to the Audit 

Committee on a quarterly basis

IC facilitates the senior management team to ensure controls in operational processes are efficient and effective, and 

regularly communicates with the Audit Committee

68

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe  IA  and  IC  provide  valuable  support  to  the  Company’s  internal  control  system.  The  IA  reviews  different  business  and 

functional operations and activities of the Group with a special focus on high risk areas. The IA also conducts ad hoc reviews 

in areas of concern identified by the senior management team. If the IA identifies any deficiencies, the relevant group, division 

or department heads will be notified on such deficiencies and will be rectified, following up with the implementation of audit 

recommendations. If the IA considers that the deficiency is a significant internal control weakness, such matter will be brought 

to the attention of the Audit Committee and the Board if necessary. The IC facilitates the establishment of the risk management 

and internal control systems with the Company’s management and monitors the implementation of effective risk management 

practices based on the COSO Framework.

In additional to providing advice on setting up and implementing policies and processes to promote effective internal control, 

IC also promotes risk management and internal controls awareness to management and employees across the Group.

The overall risk management and internal control status will be reported to the Audit Committee.

The  Audit  Committee  reviews  the  internal  control  system  annually  on  behalf  of  the  Board.  The  Board  is  satisfied  that  the 

Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  function  is  adequately  resourced  with  staff  of  appropriate  qualifications 

and  experience,  and  they  receive  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and  development.  Based  on  the  report  from  the 

Audit Committee, the Board is satisfied that the Company’s internal audit function is adequately resourced to manage the 

Group’s  risks  and  safeguard  the  Group’s  assets,  and  that  the  external  audit  process  has  been  effective.  The  Board,  with 

the recommendation of the Audit Committee, is satisfied that the Group has complied with the provisions regarding internal 

controls as required under the CG Code and is not aware of any significant issues that would have an adverse impact on the 

effectiveness and adequacy of the internal control system.

SHAREHOLDERS

The  Company  strives  to  provide  ready,  equal,  regular  and  timely  disclosure  of  information  that  is  material  to  the  investor 

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of 

the Group’s operations, business and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in  annual  general  meetings  and  other  general  meetings  or  other  proper  means.  As  such,  the  Company  sends  notice  to 

shareholders for annual general meetings at least 20 clear business days before the meeting and at least 10 clear business 

days for all other general meetings. In addition, the Company has developed and maintains the shareholders communication 

policy which is available on the Company Website.

69

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportThe Company’s general meetings provide a transparent and open platform for the Company’s shareholders to communicate 

with the Board. The Chairman, other members of the Board and relevant members of the senior management team, under 

usual circumstances, attend to answer questions raised and discuss matters in relation to the Company in an open manner. 

Save as Mr Li Dong Sheng, all directors attended the 2014 annual general meeting, with a view to understand the views of the 

Company’s shareholders. The company secretary provided the minutes of 2014 annual general meeting to all directors to have 

a thorough understanding of the Company’s shareholders views. The Company’s external auditor will also attend the annual 

general meeting to answer questions relating to the conduct of the audit, the auditor’s report and auditor independence. The 

Company’s shareholders may also propose candidates for election as a director of the Company according to the procedures 

set out in the Company Website.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any one or more shareholder(s) of the Company holding at the date of deposit of the 

requisition not less than one-tenth of the paid up capital of the Company carrying the right of voting at general meetings of 

the  Company  shall  at  all  times  have  the  right,  by  written  requisition  to  the  Board  or  the  company  secretary,  to  require  an 

extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and 

such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such requisition.

In order to ensure that shareholders’ interests and rights are adequately protected, separate resolutions will be proposed for 

each substantially separate issue at the general meetings, and all resolutions will be voted by poll pursuant to the Articles of 

Association and the Listing Rules. To ensure the shareholders are familiar with the detailed procedures for conducting a poll, 

detailed procedures for conducting a poll are explained at the commencement of the general meetings, and all questions from 

shareholder on the voting procedures can be answered before the poll voting started. An external scrutineer will be appointed 

to monitor and count the votes cast by poll. Poll results will be posted on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s 

website after each general meeting.

Apart from participating in the Company’s general meetings, the Company’s shareholders are provided with contact details of 

the Company, such as telephone number, email address and postal address which are also available on the Company Website, 

in order to enable them to make any query that they may have. Shareholders may send their enquiries to the Board directly 

through these means. Shareholders may also contact the Company’s Hong Kong branch share registrar, Computershare Hong 

Kong Investor Services Limited, if they have any enquiries about their shareholdings and entitlements to dividends.

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportDISCLOSURES OF OTHER INFORMATION

The Company is required to  disclose certain information pursuant to the Listing Rules and the CG Code. We set out these 

information below which has not been covered above.

The Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association

Upon the shareholders’ approval by way of special resolution at the 2014 annual general meeting, the Company has adopted 

the  Amended  and  Restated  Memorandum  of  Association  and  Articles  of  Association  for  the  purpose  of,  among  others, 

conforming with the latest amendments to the Listing Rules and giving effect to the Share Subdivision.

Annual Report 2014Corporate Governance ReportTo the shareholders of Tencent Holdings Limited

(incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)

We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Tencent  Holdings  Limited  (the  “Company”)  and  its  subsidiaries 

(together, the “Group”) set out on pages 74 to 197, which comprise the consolidated and company statements of financial 

position  as  at  31  December  2014,  and  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive 

income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 

and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong 

Companies  Ordinance,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of 

consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted 

our  audit  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing.  Those  standards  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical 

requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 

statements are free from material misstatement.

72

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportAn  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated 

financial  statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks 

of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements 

that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 

appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 

evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

OPINION

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 

the Group as at 31 December 2014, and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 

International Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements 

of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

OTHER MATTERS

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not 

assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally engaged in the provision of Internet and mobile value-added services (“VAS”), online advertising services and 

eCommerce transactions services to users in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interest in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

• 

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

• 

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer without 

making any payment; and

• 

the right to control the management and financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

86

Tencent Holdings LimitedNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2014(All amounts in RMB millions unless otherwise stated)1 

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 10) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company.

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 of the Group have been approved for issue 

by the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) on 18 March 2015.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 

convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial 

liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through profit and loss.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the 

predecessor Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) for this financial year and the comparative period.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures

(a)  Amendments to standards and interpretation adopted by the Group

The following amendments to standards and interpretation have been adopted by the Group for the first time 

for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2014. The adoption of these amendments to standards and 

interpretation does not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

• 

Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27, ‘Consolidation for investment entities’. These amendments 

mean that many funds and similar entities will be exempt from consolidating most of their subsidiaries. 

Instead, they will measure them at fair value through profit or loss. The amendments give an exception 

to  entities  that  meet  an  ‘investment  entity’  definition  and  which  display  particular  characteristics. 

Changes have also been made IFRS 12 to introduce disclosures that an investment entity needs to 

make.

• 

Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ on offsetting financial assets and financial 

liabilities. This amendment clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event. 

It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of business, as well as in 

the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also considers settlement mechanisms.

• 

IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the 

scope of IAS 37 ‘Provisions’. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to 

pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised. The Group is not currently subjected to significant 

levies so the impact on the Group is not material.

• 

Other standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective for the financial year beginning 

on 1 January 2014 are not relevant to the Group.

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards not yet adopted

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are not effective for the financial year beginning 

1  January  2014,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of 

the Group, except the following set out below:

• 

Amendment to IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ regarding acquisition of an interest in a joint operation. 

This  amendment  provides  new  guidance  on  how  to  account  for  the  acquisition  of  an  interest  in  a 

joint venture operation that constitutes a business. The amendments require an investor to apply the 

principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that 

constitutes a business. The amendments are applicable to both the acquisition of the initial interest 

in a joint operation and the acquisition of additional interest in the same joint operation. However, a 

previously held interest is not re-measured when the acquisition of an additional interest in the same 

joint  operation  results  in  retaining  joint  control.  The  amendment  is  effective  for  accounting  periods 

beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Early adoption is permitted.

• 

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor 

and its associate or joint venture. These amendments address an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and 

IAS 28 in the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. A full 

gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised 

when  a  transaction  involves  assets  that  do  not  constitute  a  business,  even  if  those  assets  are  in  a 

subsidiary.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  accounting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January 

2016. Early adoption is permitted.

• 

IFRS  15,  ‘Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers’  deals  with  revenue  recognition  and  establishes 

principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, 

timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. 

Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to 

direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ 

and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual 

periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards not yet adopted (Cont’d)

• 

IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 

assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the 

guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 

9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement 

categories  for  financial  assets:  amortised  cost,  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  and 

fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  The  basis  of  classification  depends  on  the  entity’s  business  model 

and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments 

are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception 

to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling. There is now a  new 

expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For 

financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition 

of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value 

through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright 

line  hedge  effectiveness  tests.  It  requires  an  economic  relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and 

hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for 

risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that 

currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 

1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.

The  Group  is  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  impact  of  the  above  new  standards  and  amendments  to 

standards on the Group’s results and financial position. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations 

that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

(c)  New Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622)

The requirements of Part 9 “Accounts and Audit” of the new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) 

come into operation as from the Company’s first financial year commencing on or after 3 March 2014 in 

accordance with section 358 of that Ordinance. The Group is in the process of making an assessment of 

expected impact of the changes in the Companies Ordinance on the consolidated financial statements in 

the period of initial application of Part 9 of the new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622). So far it 

has concluded that the impact is unlikely to be significant and only the presentation and the disclosure of 

information in the consolidated financial statements will be affected.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have 

been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration  transferred  includes  the  fair  value  of  any  asset  or  liability  resulting  from  a  contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis,  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest’s  proportionate  share  of  the  recognised 

amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed 

to  be  an  asset  or  liability  is  recognised  in  accordance  with  IAS  39  either  in  profit  or  loss  or  as  a 

change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-

measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations (Cont’d)

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-

measured to its fair value at the date when control or significant influence is lost, with the change in 

carrying amount recognised in the consolidated income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying 

amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint 

venture  or  financial  asset.  In  addition,  any  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive 

income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related 

assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 

in respect of that entity are reclassified to the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements

In  the  Company’s  statement  of  financial  position,  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at 

cost less impairment. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries 

are  accounted  for  by  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  dividends  received  and  receivable.  In  addition,  the 

contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in Note 10(d)), a controlled structured entity, 

is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust” first, and then will be transferred to the “Shares 

held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for the acquisition for the shares 

of the Company.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.3  Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying 

a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using 

the  equity  method  of  accounting  and  are  initially  recognised  at  cost,  and  the  carrying  amount  is  increased  or 

decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The 

Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment 

loss.

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where 

appropriate.

The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive  income.  The  cumulative  post-acquisition  movements  are  adjusted  against  the  carrying  amount 

of the investment. When the Group’s share of loss in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, 

including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 

legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

93

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Associates (Cont’d)

The  Group  determines  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  investments  in 

associates  are  impaired.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of  impairment  as  the  difference 

between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 

impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to 

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

2.4  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profits  or  losses  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  ventures),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interest  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed 

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments in joint 

ventures are impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between 

the recoverable amount of the joint ventures and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/

(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.5 

Investment in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The  cost  of  associates/joint  ventures  acquired  in  stages,  except  for  the  change  from  an  associate  to  a  joint 

venture; is measured as the sum of the fair value of the interest previously held plus the fair value of any additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interest is taken to the consolidated income statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised  in  prior  periods  in  relation  to  the  previously  held  interest  is  also  taken  to  the  consolidated  income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.7  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”).

Prior to 2014, the Company adopted Renminbi (“RMB”) as its functional currency. However, as a  result 

of  the  Group’s  continuous  acquisitions  and  financing  activities  undertaken  in  recent  years,  the  investing 

and financing activities of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries have increasingly placed 

reliance on United States Dollars (“USD”) instead of RMB. As such, the Company and certain of its overseas 

subsidiaries changed their functional currency from RMB to USD effective from 1 June 2014. The directors 

of  the  Company  consider  USD  would  be  more  appropriate  to  act  as  the  functional  currency  in  reflecting 

the underlying transactions that are relevant to the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries. Such 

change has not resulted in any material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

The Company and the Group’s presentation currency is RMB.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.7  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-

sale financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised 

cost of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences 

related to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 

through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value gain or 

loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available-for-

sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.

(c)  Group companies

The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary 

economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are translated into 

the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income  and  expenses  for  each  consolidated  income  statement  are  translated  at  average  exchange 

rates  (unless  this  average  is  not  a  reasonable  approximation  of  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  rates 

prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on 

the dates of the transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.7  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(c)  Group companies (Cont’d)

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.8  Fixed assets

All fixed assets are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment charge. 

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  cost  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

3 - 5 years

5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to fixed assets when completed and ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.13).

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in 

“Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.9 

Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  the  straight-line  method  to  allocate  their  costs  to  their  residual  values  over  their 

estimated useful lives of 50 years.

Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each 

reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.10 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease or 

capitalised in construction in progress upon completion of construction.

2.11 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of 

the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities 

and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

(b) 

Licensed online contents

The licensed online contents mainly include video and music contents. They are initially recognised  and 

measured  at  cost.  Licensed  online  contents  are  amortised  using  an  accelerated  method  or  straight-line 

method reflect the estimated consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other  intangible  assets  mainly  include  licenses,  computer  software  and  technology  and  non-compete 

agreements. They are initially recognised and measured at cost or estimated fair value of intangible assets 

acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally two to seven years) using 

the  straight-line  method  reflects  the  pattern  in  which  the  intangible  asset’s  future  economic  benefits  are 

expected to be consumed.

2.12 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 10(d)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as  “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 

at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial 

assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 

reporting date.

2.14 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans 

and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which 

the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets are quoted in an active 

market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

(i) 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 

category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 

classified as non-current.

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Loans to associates”, “Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the 

statement of financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 

classified in any other category. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 

to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.14 Financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date - the date on which the Group 

commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  asset.  Investments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  plus  transaction 

costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the 

consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 

the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks 

and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit 

or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method.

Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale financial 

assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.

When securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 

value  adjustments  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  included  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement as gains and losses from investment securities.

Dividends on available-for-sale financial assets equity instruments are recognised in the consolidated income 

statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

2.15 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  and  the  net  amount  is  reported  in  the  statement  of  financial  position 

when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 

net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 

contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 

insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired 

and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or 

more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or 

events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets 

that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 

impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, 

the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market 

price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  reversal  of  the  previously  recognised  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated income statement.

2.16 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 

asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

For debt securities, if any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between 

the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously 

recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  –  is  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  a  debt  instrument  classified 

as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the 

impairment  loss  was  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed 

through the consolidated income statement.

For equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also 

evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the 

difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 

asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement - is removed from equity and recognised 

in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement 

on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.

2.17 Derivative financial instruments

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.

The  derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are accounted for at fair value through 

profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 

recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.18 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

104

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.19 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for merchandise sold or services performed in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.20 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, money market funds and other 

short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

2.21 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  share  capital  (treasury  share),  the  considerations 

paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 

equity  holders  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued,  any 

consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.22 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.23 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request the 

Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are met. If 

the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial assets under the put 

option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the 

put option. The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates 

of  payments,  the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised 

estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of revised 

estimated  future  cash  outflows  at  the  financial  instrument’s  original  effective  interest  rate  and  the  adjustments 

will be recognised as income or expenses in the consolidated income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.24 Borrowings and notes payable

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their period using the 

effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.25 Compound financial instruments

Compound  financial  instruments  of  the  Group  comprise  convertible  note  of  a  subsidiary  assumed  in  business 

combination that can be converted to share capital of a subsidiary at the option of the holder, and the number of 

shares to be issued may vary.

The Group designated the compound financial instruments as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 

They are initially recognised at fair value. Any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised as finance costs 

in the consolidated income statement. Subsequent to initial recognition, the compound financial instruments are 

carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.

The compound financial instruments are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right 

to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

2.26 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 

equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  However,  the  deferred 

income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting 

nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 

deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.27 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The Group contributes on a monthly basis to various defined contribution benefit plans organised by the 

relevant governmental authorities. The Group’s liability in respect of these plans is limited to the contributions 

payable in each period. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. Assets of the plans are held 

and managed by government authorities and are separated from those of the Group.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share award schemes), under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity 

instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of  the  Group.  The  fair  value  of  the  employee 

services received in exchange for the grant of equity instruments of the Group is recognised as an expense 

over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  the  period  over  which  all  of  the  specified  vesting  conditions  are  to  be 

satisfied, and credited to share premium under equity.

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 

options granted by using an option-pricing model - Black-Scholes valuation model (the “BS Model”), which 

includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) but excludes 

the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award shares, the total 

amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant 

date. The Group also adopts valuation technique to assess the fair value of other equity instruments of the 

Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation expenses, which are recognised in the consolidated financial statement, are treated as part of 

the “Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

2.27 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

At each reporting period end, the Group and the Company revise their estimates of the number of options 

and awarded shares that are expected to ultimately vest. They recognise the impact of the revision of original 

estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement of the Group and in the “Investments in subsidiaries” 

of the Company, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the remaining vesting period.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

2.28 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 

the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.29 Revenue recognition

The  Group  principally  derives  revenues  from  provision  of  VAS,  online  advertising  services  and  eCommerce 

transactions services in the PRC.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  are  derived  principally  from  the  provision  of  online  games,  community  value-added 

services and applications across various Internet and mobile platforms.

2.29 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

The VAS can be paid by way of prepaid cards and tokens (represented a specific amount of payment unit) 

sold  by  the  Group  through  channels  such  as  sales  agents  appointed  by  the  Group,  telecommunication 

operators, broadband service providers, Internet cafes and banks. The end users can register the prepaid 

cards  and  tokens  to  their  user  accounts  in  the  Group’s  platforms  and  then  access  the  Group’s  online 

products or relevant services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid cards and tokens are deferred and recorded 

as “Deferred revenue” in the statement of financial position (see Note 27). The amounts are then recognised 

as revenue based on the actual utilisation of the payment unit: (i) when the payment unit is used to purchase 

services, the revenue is recognised when the related services are rendered; (ii) when the payment unit is 

used to purchase virtual products/items in the Group’s Internet platforms, the revenue is recognised over the 

estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/items or over the expected user relationship.

Certain  VAS  service  are  directly  delivered  to  the  Group’s  customers  through  the  platforms  of  various 

subsidiaries of telecommunication operators in the PRC, namely China Mobile Communications Corporation 

(“China Mobile”), China United Network Communications Group Company Limited (“China Unicom”) and 

China Telecommunications Corporation (“China Telecom”), and through other third party platforms. These 

operators and third party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Internet and Mobile Service Fees”) 

on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to certain percentages commission fee (defined as “Channel 

costs”).  The  Channel  costs  are  withheld  and  deducted  from  the  gross  Internet  and  Mobile  Service  Fees 

collected by these operators and platforms from the users, with the net amounts remitted to the Group. The 

Group recognises the Internet and Mobile Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis and treats the Channel 

costs as cost of revenues.

Determining  whether  revenue  of  the  Group  should  be  reported  gross  or  net  is  based  on  a  continuing 

assessment  of  various  factors,  the  primary  factors  being  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  the  principal  in 

offering services to the customer or whether the Group is acting as an agent in the transaction. The Group 

has determined that it is acting as the principal in offering services as the Group (i) is the primary obligor in 

the arrangement; (ii) has latitude in establishing the selling price; (iii) has discretion in suppliers selection; 

and  (iv)  has  involvement  in  the  determination  of  product  specifications.  Therefore,  the  Group  adopted 

different revenue recognition method based on specific responsibilities in different VAS.

2.29 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

The Group also opens its Internet platforms to third-party game/application developers through co-operation 

agreements  entered  into  with  them.  The  games/applications  designed,  developed  and  hosted  by  these 

developers are made available to the users on the Group’s Internet and mobile platforms. Under the terms of 

these co-operation agreements, the Group pays the developers a pre-determined percentage of the fees paid 

by and collected from end users for the virtual products/items utilised in the games/applications. The Group 

recognises the related revenue on a gross or net basis according to the terms of the relevant co-operation 

agreements defining the obligation of the Group, i.e. whether the Group is acting as the principal in offering 

services to the end users or is acting an agent in the arrangements. The Group defers the related revenue, 

for both gross and net basis, over an the estimated lifespan of the respective virtual products/items or over 

the expected user relationship periods as there is an implicit obligation of the Group to maintain and allow 

access of the users of the games/applications operated by the developers through its platforms.

Revenues derived from these arrangements are presented as revenue from VAS in the consolidated income 

statement.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues are mainly derived from display advertisements to instant messaging users, and 

on portals, social networks, video and other platforms operated by the Group. It also includes income derived 

from performance based advertisements in which the revenue is linked to actual performance measurement. 

Commissions payable to advertising agencies are recognised as a component of the cost of revenues.

For  brand  display  advertising,  advertising  contracts  with  terms  within  one  year  are  entered  into  with  the 

advertisers and their advertising agencies and the related revenues are recognised ratably over the period in 

which the advertisements are displayed.

For performance based advertising, the Group introduces Internet users to its advertisers mainly through its 

performance based pay-for-click systems and it charges advertisers on a per click basis when the users click 

on the displayed links. Revenue for performance based advertising is primarily recognised on a per click 

basis when the users click on the displayed links.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.29 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(c) 

eCommerce transactions

Revenues  derived  from  eCommerce  transactions  business  of  the  Group  primarily  arise  from  sales  of 

merchandise  through  the  Group’s  Internet  platforms.  The  Group  recognises  revenues  from  merchandise 

sales and related costs on a gross basis when it acts as a principal. Following the guidance under IAS 18 

‘Revenue’, whether the Group acts as a principal is based on a number of criteria, including whether it is a 

primary obligor, whether it is subject to inventory risk, whether it has latitude in establishing prices, whether 

it has latitude in selecting suppliers, in a transaction. When the Group is not a principal and is instead acting 

as an agent, revenues are recognised on a net basis which is based on a pre-determined percentage of the 

sales.

For merchandise sold under the eCommerce transactions business, the customers place their orders online 

with a commitment made at a fixed selling price. Payment for the purchased merchandise is made either 

before delivery or upon delivery. When the Group is acting as a principal, revenues, net of discounts and 

return allowances and value-added tax, are recognised when the merchandise is physically delivered to the 

respective customers. Return allowances, which reduce the gross amount of revenues, are estimated based 

on historical experience.

2.30 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

2.31 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.32 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.33 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.34 Dividends distribution

Dividends  distribution  to  the  Company’s  shareholders  is  recognised  as  a  liability  in  the  Group  and  Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors.

2.35 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criteria are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development  costs  previously  recognised  as  expenses  are  not  recognised  as  assets  in  subsequent  periods. 

Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the assets are ready for use on a straight-line 

basis over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding five years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency exposures, primarily with respect to RMB, HKD, EUR, KRW and USD. Foreign exchange risk 

arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a 

currency that is not the group entities’ functional currency. The functional currency of the Company 

and  majority  of  its  overseas  subsidiaries  are  USD  whereas  functional  currency  of  the  subsidiaries 

operate in the PRC are RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures through natural hedges, wherever possible 

and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, when necessary.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2014,  the  Group  reported  exchange  losses  of  approximately 

RMB316  million  (2013:  exchange  gains  of  approximately  RMB310  million)  as  a  result  of  RMB 
depreciation.  The  gains/losses  were  recorded  in  “Finance  costs,  net”  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement.

Note:

(1) 

The data as at 31 December 2013 was presented as before the effect of the change in functional currency of 

the Company and certain group entities.

(2) 

At 31 December 2013, if EUR, HKD, KRW and USD had strengthened/weakened by 5% against RMB with 

all other variables held constant, the profit before income tax for the year would have been approximately 

RMB506 million lower/higher, mainly as a result of net foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of net 

monetary liabilities denominated in EUR, HKD, KRW and USD.

(3) 

At 31 December 2014, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange rates of the 

above currencies against the two major functional currencies would not result in a significant change in the 

Group’s results. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.

(4) 

Given the exchange rate peg between HKD and USD, it is not foreseen that the Company will be exposed to 

significant exchange rate risk for the transactions conducted in HKD or USD.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group, classified as available-

for-sale financial assets. To manage its price risk arising from the investments, the Group diversifies 

its portfolio. The investments made by the Group are either for the purpose of improving investment 

yield and maintaining high liquidity level simultaneously, or for strategic purpose. Each investment is 

managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to equity price risks of available-for-sale 

financial assets at the end of the reporting period. If equity prices of the respective instruments held by 

the Group had been 5% (2013: 5%) higher/lower as at 31 December 2014, the other comprehensive 

income would have been approximately RMB642 million (2013: RMB603 million) higher/lower.

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest  rates  and  the  Group  has  no  significant  interest-bearing  assets  except  for  receivables  from 

investees and investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 16, 17 and 18.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable,  details  of  which  have  been  disclosed  in  Notes  25  and  26.  Borrowings  and  notes  payable 

carry at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate risk whereas those carry at fixed rates 

expose the Group to fair value interest-rate risk.

The Group’s borrowings were carried at floating rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate 

risk whereas the notes payable, which representing the larger portion of the Group’s debts, were all 

carried at fixed rates which do not expose the Group to cash flow interest-rate risk.

The Group regularly monitors its interest rate risk to ensure there are no undue exposures to significant 

interest rate movements and regular reporting is provided to the management for the Group’s debt and 

interest rates exposure.

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk (Cont’d)

Other financial assets and liabilities do not expose the Group to any material interest rate risk.

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2014,  if  the  average  interest  rate  on  variable  interest-bearing 

borrowings had been 5% (2013: 5%) higher/lower, the Group’s profit before income tax for the year 

would have been approximately RMB8 million (2013: RMB3 million) lower/higher.

The Company had no variable interest-bearing liabilities.

(b)  Credit risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its cash and deposits (including restricted cash) placed with 

banks and financial institutions, other investments, as well as accounts and other receivables.

The carrying amount of each class of the above financial assets represents the Group’s maximum exposure 

to credit risk in relation to the corresponding class of financial assets.

To  manage  this  risk,  deposits  are  mainly  placed  with  state-owned  financial  institutions  in  the  PRC  and 

reputable international financial institutions outside of the PRC. There has been no recent history of default 

in relation to these financial institutions.

For accounts receivable, a large portion of Internet and Mobile Service Fees is derived from the co-operative 

arrangements with China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom and other third party platform providers. 

If the strategic relationship with these telecommunications operators and third party platform providers are 

terminated or scaled-back; or if these telecommunications operators and third party platform providers alter 

the co-operative arrangements; or if they experience financial difficulties in paying us, the Group’s VAS might 

be adversely affected in terms of recoverability of the related receivable balances.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(b)  Credit risk (Cont’d)

To manage this risk, the Group maintains frequent communication with these telecommunication operators 

and third party platform providers to ensure the co-operation is effective. In view of the history of co-operation 

with these telecommunication operators and third party platform providers and the sound collection history 

of receivables due from them, management believes that the credit risk inherent in the Group’s outstanding 

accounts receivable balances from these counterparties is low (see Note 15 for details).

For accounts receivable due from advertising customers, which are mainly advertising agencies, the credit 

quality of each customer is assessed, which takes into account its financial position, past experience and 

other factors. Normally, prepayments representing a certain percentage of the total service fees for  each 

advertising service are required.

(c) 

Liquidity risk

The  Group  aims  to  maintain  sufficient  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities.  Due  to  the 

dynamic  nature  of  the  underlying  businesses,  the  Group  maintains  flexibility  in  funding  by  maintaining 

adequate cash and cash equivalents.

based on the remaining period since the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital referred to the equity and external debts (including borrowings and notes payable). In order to maintain or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management (Cont’d)

The Group monitors capital by regularly reviewing debts to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 

amortisation (“EBITDA”) (note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflecting 

financial  health  and  liquidity  position.  The  debts/adjusted  EBITDA  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  debts  by 

adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

The increase in debts to EBITDA is mainly a result of certain senior notes issued by the Group during the year, 

details of which have been disclosed in Note 26.

Note:

Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  operating  profit  less  interest  income  and  other  gains/losses,  net,  and  plus  depreciation  of  fixed 

assets and investment properties and amortisation of intangible assets and equity-settled share-based compensation expenses

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2014 by level of 

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

• 

• 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

• 

• 

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end 

of the reporting period, with the resulting value discounted back to present value; and

• 

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2014, total losses for the level 3 instruments held at the end of the reporting 

period were RMB369 million (2013: RMB26 million) under “Other gains/(losses), net”.

Valuation processes of the Group (Level 3)

The Group has a team that manages the valuation logistics of level 3 instruments for financial reporting purposes. 

The team manages the valuation logistics at least once every quarter, in line with the Group’s quarterly reporting 

dates. On an annual basis, the team would also manage the valuation logistics, and use valuation techniques to 

determine the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments by themselves.

The  valuation  of  the  level  3  instruments  mainly  included  private  funds  and  unlisted  companies.  As  these 

investments are not traded in an active market, their fair value have been determined using discounted cash flow 

valuation techniques if applicable. Major assumptions used in the valuation include historical financial results, 

assumptions about future growth rates and estimate of weighted average cost of capital (WACC), etc.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  Recognition of share-based compensation expenses

As mentioned in Note 2.27(c), the Group has granted share options to its employees. The directors have used the 

BS Model to determine the total fair value of the options granted, which is to be expensed over the vesting period. 

Significant judgement on parameters, such as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be 

made by the directors in applying the BS Model (Note 21).

The  fair  value  of  options  granted  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2014  determined  using  the  BS  Model  was 

approximately HKD508 million (equivalent to approximately RMB403 million). There was no share option granted 

to employees in 2013.

In addition, the Group granted awarded shares to its employees at an aggregate fair value of HKD3,907 million 

(equivalent to approximately RMB3,094 million) in 2014 (2013: HKD1,615 million (equivalent to approximately 

RMB1,287 million)).

The  Group  has  to  estimate  the  expected  yearly  percentage  of  grantees  of  share  options/awarded  shares  who 

will stay within the Group at the end of the vesting periods (“Expected Retention Rate of Grantees”) in order to 

determine the amount of share-based compensation expenses charged into the consolidated income statement. 

As at 31 December 2014, the Expected Retention Rate of Grantees was assessed to be 85% (2013: 91%).

If  the  Expected  Retention  Rate  of  Grantees  had  been  increased/decreased  by  5%  (2013:  5%),  the  amount  of 

share-based compensation expenses would be increased/decreased by RMB73 million (2013: RMB78 million).

(b)  The  estimates  of  the  lifespan  of  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s  Internet  and  mobile 

platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.29(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s 

Internet and mobile platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the lifespan of the virtual products/

items or the expected user relationship periods. The Group uses the available information, including the historical 

user pattern and behavior and the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/items, to estimate the 

lifespan of these products/items. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lives of the permanent 

life virtual products/items on a timely basis.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  The  estimates  of  the  lifespan  of  virtual  products/items  provided  in  the  Group’s  Internet  and  mobile 

platforms (Cont’d)

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespan of the virtual products/items (provided and to be provided), 

which  may  differ  from  the  historical  period,  and  any  change  in  the  estimates  may  result  in  the  revenue  being 

recognised on a different basis than in prior periods.

(c) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining 

the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax 

determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of 

whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax liabilities in 

the period in which such determination is made.

Were the actual final outcome (on the judgement areas) to differ by 5% from management’s estimates, the Group 

would need to:

• 

Increase the income tax liabilities by RMB23 million (2013: RMB66 million) and the deferred tax liabilities by 

RMB147 million (2013: RMB72 million), if unfavourable; or

• 

Decrease the income tax liabilities by RMB23 million (2013: RMB66 million) and the deferred tax liabilities 

by RMB147 million (2013: RMB72 million), if favourable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Estimation of put option liabilities

The Group granted some put options to the non-controlling interest owners that they have the right to request the 

Group to repurchase their equity interests in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries when certain conditions are 

met. The repurchase prices were determined by making reference to the revenue or profit to be generated  by 

those subsidiaries in future periods. The Group will initially recognise a financial liability at the present value of the 

estimated future cash outflows under the put option arrangement, and at the end of each subsequent period, the 

Group will revisit their estimations. If the Group revises its estimates of payments, the Group will adjust the carrying 

amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash outflows and the adjustments will be 

recognised as income or expenses in the consolidated income statement.

(e)  Recoverability of non-financial assets

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Other non-financial assets are reviewed 

for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be 

recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-use calculations or fair value less 

costs to sell. These calculations require the use of judgments and estimates.

Judgement  is  required  to  determine  key  assumptions  adopted  in  the  valuation  models  for  impairment  review 

purpose. Changing the assumptions selected by management in assessing impairment could materially affect the 

result of the impairment test and as a result affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. If there 

is a significant adverse change in the key assumptions applied, it may be necessary to take additional impairment 

charge to the consolidated income statement.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to operating segments. Most of the goodwill is related to 

the operating segment of VAS.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The management 

calculates fair value less costs to sell based on ratios of EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA (earnings before interest,  tax, 

depreciation and amortisation) of several public comparable companies multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU 

and discounted for the lack of marketability.

Except  for  those  goodwill  arising  from  subsidiaries  acquired  during  the  year,  the  key  assumptions  used  for  the 

calculations of fair value less costs to sell, for purpose of the impairment tests on material balances of goodwill, in 2014 

and 2013 are as follows:

EV/EBITDA

Discount for the lack of marketability

2014

2013

4.8-9.9x

20-30%

4.1-6.3x

20-30%

The public comparable companies are considered with factors such as industry similarity, company size, profitability and 

financial risk.

Based on the assessment made by management, the carrying amount of goodwill and other identify intangible assets 

recognised for the investment in a subsidiary had been reduced to their expected recoverable amount by recognising an 

impairment loss amounting to RMB77 million and related tax impact. The loss and related tax impact had been included 

in “Other gains, net” and “Income tax expense” in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 

2014.

All subsidiaries’ undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary 

undertakings held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The 

parent company further does not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings 

included in the Group.

Note:

(i) 

The amount represents share-based compensation expenses arising from grants of share options and awarded shares of 

the Company to employees of subsidiaries in exchange for their services provided to the subsidiaries, which were deemed 

to be investment made by the Company into these subsidiaries.

(ii) 

All these balances are unsecured and interest-free and their repayments are neither planned nor likely to occur in the 

foreseeable future.

(iii) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these subsidiaries. Nevertheless, under 

certain contractual agreements entered into with the registered owners of these subsidiaries, the Company and its other 

legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their financial and 

operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting the 

majority  of  votes  at  meetings  of  such  authorities.  In  addition,  such  contractual  agreements  also  transfer  the  risks  and 

rewards of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as 

controlled structured entities of the Company.

(iv) 

The  directors  of  the  Company  considered  that  the  non-controlling  interests  of  any  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries  are 

not  significant  to  the  Group,  therefore,  no  summarised  financial  information  of  the  relevant  subsidiaries  is  presented 

separately.

(b)  Significant restrictions

Cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB49,707 million 

are held in Mainland China and are subject to local exchange control regulations. These local exchange control 

regulations provide for restrictions on payment of dividends, share repurchase and offshore investments, etc.

(c)  Amounts due from/(to) subsidiaries

The  amounts  due  from/(to)  subsidiaries  as  at  31  December  2014  represented  current  account  balances 

maintained  by  the  Company  with  certain  subsidiaries.  All  balances  are  unsecured  and  interest-free  and  the 

balances are repayable on demand. As at 31 December 2014, the amounts due from subsidiaries were neither 

past due nor impaired.

(d)  Consolidation of structured entities

As  mentioned  in  Note  10(a)  (iii)  above,  the  Company  has  consolidated  the  operating  entities  within  the  Group 

without  any  legal  interests.  In  addition,  due  to  the  implementation  of  the  share  award  schemes  of  the  Group 

mentioned  in  Note  21(b),  the  Company  has  also  set  up  a  structured  entity  (“Share  Scheme  Trust”),  and  its 

particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering  and  holding  the  Company’s  shares  acquired  for  share  award  schemes 

which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can 

derive benefits from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the 

directors of the Company consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

For the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company contributed approximately RMB529 million (2013: RMB278 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Management  has  assessed  the  level  of  influence  that  the  Group  has  on  certain  associates,  with  a  total  carrying  amount  of 

RMB29,311 million (2013: 3,072 million) as at 31 December 2014, and determined that it has significant influence even though 

the shareholding is below 20% because of the board representation or other arrangements. Consequently, these investments 

have been classified as associates.

(b)

(c) 

Transactions with associates

The  Group  also  provided/purchased  online  traffic  and  other  Internet  value-added  services  to/from  certain  of  its  associates. 

Revenues/costs recorded by the Group from such transactions were summarised as below:

(i) 

Transactions with JD.com

On March 10, 2014, the Group entered into a strategic co-operation agreement and formed a strategic partnership with 

JD.com, an associate of the Group. As part of the strategic partnership, the Group agreed to offer JD.com level 1 access 

points  in  the  mobile  applications  Weixin  and  Mobile  QQ  and  provide  Internet  traffic  and  other  support  from  other  key 

platforms  to  JD.com.  The  strategic  partnership  represents  a  deferred  revenue  arrangement,  and  the  fair  value  of  this 

arrangement, at the inception date, was recorded as “deferred revenue” in the consolidated statement of financial position, 

and has subsequently credited to the consolidated income statement over a period of five years. During the year ended 31 

December 2014, the Group had recognised revenue in respect of the above arrangement.

(ii) 

Transactions with other associates

During  the  years  ended  31  December  2014  and  2013,  the  Group  entered  into  co-operation  agreements  with  certain 

associates, pursuant to which the associates operate their games/applications on the Group’s Internet platforms, which are 

available to the users of the Group. The Group pays the associates a pre-determined percentage of the fees paid by and 

collected from end users for the virtual products/items utilised in their games/applications. In 2014 and 2013, the revenue 

recorded by the Group from the above cooperation with associates was not material.

As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group was entitled to certain call options and conversion options associated with 

its interests in associates. The directors of the Company considered that the fair values of such options were insignificant 

and accordingly, the Group did not separately recognise these options in the consolidated financial statements.

There are no contingent liabilities relating to the Group’s interest in the associates.

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profits (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Funds. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With approvals obtained from their respective boards of directors of these companies, the Reserve Fund can be used to offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

This share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and restricted share award schemes adopted by non-

wholly owned subsidiaries (Note 21(d)).

(d) 

During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group acquired additional equity interests and disposed certain equity interests 

in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group, including as part of the business combination (Note 41), at aggregate 

considerations of RMB1,342 million and RMB702 million, respectively. The excess of considerations and the carrying amounts of 

non-controlling interests of the acquisitions and disposals of RMB1,224 million and RMB698 million, respectively was recognised 

directly in equity.

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted four share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II and Post-IPO Option Scheme III, under which the directors may, at their 

discretion, grant options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms 

and conditions stipulated therein.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme expired on 31 December 2011. Post-IPO Option Scheme I was terminated upon the 

adoption of the Post-IPO Option Scheme II.

In respect of Post-IPO Option Scheme II and Post-IPO Option Scheme III, the exercise price must be at least the 

higher of: (1) the closing price of the Company’s shares as stated in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheet on 

the date of grant, which must be a business day; (2) the average closing price of the Company’s shares as stated 

in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheets for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; 

and (3) the nominal value of the Company’s shares. In addition, the option vesting period is determined by the 

Board provided that it is not later than the last day of a 7-year or 10-year period after the date of grant of option.

Upon the Share Subdivision became effective, pro-rata adjustments were made to the exercise prices and  the 

number of share options outstanding, so as to give the participants the same proportion of the equity capital as that 

they were entitled to before the effect of the Share Subdivision.

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the BS Model to determine the fair value of the options granted, 

which is to be expensed over the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 

the year ended 31 December 2014 was HKD36.97 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB29.28 per 

share) after the effect of the Share Subdivision (2013: no option was granted).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgment on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the BS Model, 

which is summarised as below.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted two share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”), both of which are managed 

by an independent trustee appointed by the Group (the “Trustee”) as of 31 December 2014. The vesting period of 

the awarded share is determined by the Board.

During the year ended 31 December 2014, 25,000 awarded shares (before the effect of the Share Subdivision) 

were granted to three independent non-executive directors of the Company (2013: no awarded share was granted 

to any director of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2014  was 

HKD120.15 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB95.15 per share) after the effect of the Share Subdivision 

(2013: HKD311.24 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB248.05 per share) before the effect of the Share 

Subdivision).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2014 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis 

as at their grant date. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from three 

months to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent 

year.

21  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(c)  Employee incentive scheme

In  2011,  for  aligning  the  interests  of  key  employees  with  the  Group,  the  Group  established  an  employees’ 

investment  plan  in  the  form  of  a  limited  liability  partnership  (the  “EIS”)  pursuant  to  a  shareholders’  resolution 

passed at the 2011 annual general meeting of the Company held on 11 May 2011. The Board may, at its absolute 

discretion, select any employee of the Group, excluding any director of the Company, to participate in the EIS by 

subscribing for the partnership interest at cash consideration. The participating employees are entitled to all the 

economic benefits generated by the EIS (if any) after a specified vesting period under the EIS, ranging from up 

to 4 to 7 years. In 2014, another EIS with similar arrangement was approved by the Board and was established 

accordingly.

Two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company act as general partner of these two EISs administrate respectively 

and in essence, control them. These two EISs are therefore consolidated by the Company. The related expenses 

incurred for the year ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 were considered to be insignificant to the Group by the 

directors of the Company.

(d)  Share options and restricted share award schemes adopted by non-wholly owned subsidiaries

Certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share 

option and/or restricted share award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting 

periods of the share options and awarded shares are determined by the board of directors of these subsidiaries 

at their sole discretion. Similar to the share option/award schemes adopted by the Company, the share options or 

restricted shares of the subsidiaries so granted are normally vested by several tranches. Participants of some non-

wholly owned subsidiaries have the right to request the Group to repurchase their vested equity interests of the 

respective non-wholly owned subsidiaries (“Repurchase Transaction”). For certain participants, the Group have 

discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Group or by cash. For the 

Repurchase Transaction which the Group have settlement options, there are certain portions that the directors of 

the Company are currently of the view, that they would be settled by equity instruments of the Group. As a result, 

they are accounted for using the equity-settled share-based payment method. The remaining portion is accounted 

for as cash-settled share-based payments.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2014, the Expected Retention Rate for the grantees from the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was 

assessed to be 85% (2013: 91%).

(d) 

On 10 April 2014, the Company established a Global Medium Term Note Programme (the “Programme”) under which it may 

issue medium term notes, in series of aggregate principal amount of up to USD5,000 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) 

to professional investors. These notes will be issued in series with different issue dates and terms and may be denominated 

in any currency subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives. The Programme is listed on the Stock 

Exchange. The Company utilises the Programme as a platform to enhance its flexibility and efficiency for future funding or capital 

management from a medium to long term prospective.

(i) 

On 29 April 2014, the Company issued two tranches of senior notes under the Programme with an aggregate principal 

amount of USD2,500 million, comprising USD500 million senior notes due 2017 (the “2014 Notes I”) and USD2,000 

million senior notes due 2019 (the “2014 Notes II”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes I and the 

2014  Notes  II  amounted  to  approximately  USD2,488  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB15,306  million),  after 

deduction  of  underwriting  fees,  discounts  and  commissions  but  not  other  expenses  payable  in  connection  with  the 

issuance. Both of the 2014 Notes I and 2014 Notes II are listed on the Stock Exchange.

(ii) 

On 16 May 2014, the Company issued the third tranche of senior notes under the Programme (the “2014 Notes III”). 

The  net  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  the  2014  Notes  III  amounted  to  approximately  HKD1,998  million  (equivalent 

to  approximately  RMB1,588  million),  after  deduction  of  underwriting  fees,  discounts  and  commissions  but  not  other 

expenses payable in connection with the issuance. The 2014 Notes III are listed on the Stock Exchange.

(iii)  On 21 October 2014, the Company issued another tranche of senior notes under the Programme (the “2014 Notes IV”). 

The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes IV amounted to approximately HKD1,196 million (equivalent to 

approximately RMB948 million) after deduction of underwriting fees, discounts and commissions but not other expenses 

payable in connection with the issuance.

There is no security or pledge offered by the Group for issuing these notes.

As  at  31  December  2014,  the  fair  value  of  the  notes  payable  amounted  to  RMB27,528  million  (2013:  RMB9,476 

million). The respective fair values are assessed based on the active market price of these notes on the reporting date or 

by making reference to similar instruments traded in the observable market.

The deferred income tax assets recognised are mainly related to the temporary differences arising from certain intra-group software 

and  technology  transfer  transactions.  The  credit  to  consolidated  income  statement  represents  tax  impacts  of  originating  temporary 

differences  arising  from  these  software  and  technology  transfer,  while  the  charge  to  consolidated  income  statement  represents  tax 

impacts of the reversal of the temporary differences as a result of the amortisation of the costs of these software and technology.

The Group only recognises deferred income tax assets for cumulative tax losses if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be 

available to utilise those tax losses. Management will continue to assess the recognition of deferred income tax assets in future reporting 

periods. As at 31 December 2014, the Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of RMB866 million (2013: RMB443 million) 

in respect of cumulative tax losses amounting to RMB3,525 million (2013: RMB2,057 million). These tax losses will expire from 2015 to 

2019.

withholding tax had been provided for the earnings of approximately RMB10,607 million (2013: RMB15,818 million)

Note:

(a) 

The  impairment  provision  for  investees  recognised  in  “Other  gains,  net”  included  impairment  provision  for  investment  in 

associates  and  redeemable  preference  shares  of  associates  of  RMB1,959  million  (2013:  RMB61  million)  and  impairment 

provision for available-for-sale financial assets of RMB478 million (2013: RMB26 million).

(b) 

The disposal gains recognised in “Other gains, net” are mainly for:

(i) 

The disposal of certain eCommerce related business (“Transferred Business”) of the Group, which forms a part of the 

consideration made for the investment in JD.com (Note 11(a)(i)) amounted to RMB1,942 million, being the difference 

between  the  consideration  for  the  Transferred  Business  and  the  net  asset  value  of  the  Transferred  Business  upon 

completion of the disposal of the Transferred Business.

(ii) 

In  May  2014,  Kakao  Corporation,  an  associate  of  the  Group,  entered  into  an  agreement  to  merge  with  Daum 

Communications  Corporation  (“Daum  Communications”),  where  Daum  Communications  is  the  surviving  corporation. 

Daum Communications is listed on the Korea Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (KOSDAQ) market of the Korea 

Exchange and runs a portal website in Korea named www.daum.net. The merger transaction was completed in October 

2014.  As  a  result  of  the  transaction,  the  Group’s  interest  in  the  merged  entity  is  diluted  and  a  gain  amounting  to 

RMB1,176 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement.

(iii) 

The  Group  also  recognised  net  disposals/deemed  disposals  gains  on  associates  and  other  investee  companies  of

(ii)  Hong Kong profits tax

Hong Kong profits tax provision has been provided at the rate of 16.5% on the estimated assessable profits 

for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.

(iii)  PRC Corporate Income Tax

Corporate income tax (“CIT”) provision was made on the estimated assessable profits of entities within the 

Group incorporated in the PRC for the year ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, calculated in accordance 

with  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  PRC  after  considering  the  available  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and

March 2007 (the “CIT Law”), the CIT rate is 25% for domestic and foreign enterprises in 2014.

In  2014,  certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  in  the  PRC  were  approved  as  High  and  New  Technology 

Enterprise, and accordingly, they were subject to a reduced preferential CIT rate of 15% for a 3-year period 

from 2014 to 2016 according to the applicable CIT Law. Moreover, one of these subsidiaries was further 

approved as a national key software enterprise, and accordingly, its CIT rates for 2013 and 2014 were further 

reduced to the preferential rate of 10%.

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Company are entitled to other tax concessions and they are exempt from CIT for two years, followed by a

commercial operation or from the first year of profitable operation, after offsetting tax losses generated in 

prior years.

(iv)  United States Corporate Income Tax

United States CIT provision was provided for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 for the entities 

within  the  Group  which  were  incorporated  in  the  United  States  with  estimated  assessable  profits,  at

to  a  foreign  investor  with  respect  to  profits  derived  after  1  January  2008  are  generally  subject  to  a  10% 

withholding tax. If a foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong and meets the conditions or requirements 

under  the  double  taxation  arrangement  entered  into  between  the  Mainland  China  and  Hong  Kong,  the 

relevant withholding tax rate will be reduced from 10% to 5%. Hence, the Group used 5% to accrue the 

withholding  tax  for  certain  Hong  Kong  intermediate  holding  companies  which  are  expected  to  fulfill  the 

aforesaid conditions.

(b)  Diluted

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption of 

the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted by 

the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS), taking into account the effect 

of the Share Subdivision. No adjustment is made to earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. During the year ended 31 December 2014, these 

share options and restricted shares had either anti-dilutive effect or insignificant dilutive effect to the Group.
