Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s StatementBUSINESS REVIEW AND OUTLOOK

1. 

Company Strategic Highlights

In 2017, we fortified our “Connection” strategy by enriching our content and services, thus promoting interaction and 

sharing among our users in innovative ways.

—  QQ: We focused on rolling out entertainment-oriented features which appealed to young users, driving their time 

spent on smart devices. Our KanDian news feed service targets the entertainment-oriented  information needs of 

young users. We have strengthened KanDian’s curation capability and recommendation algorithms to offer a more 

personalized news feed service and to enhance user stickiness. QQ released a series of AI-enabled features which 

encourage users to interact in rich media formats with entertaining tools, such as face swap effects and video chat 

filters.

—  Weixin and WeChat: We further grew Weixin’s and WeChat’s user bases, such that their combined monthly active 

users  exceeded  1  billion  accounts  after  the  Chinese  New  Year.  Since  the  launch  of  Mini  Programs  in  January 

2017, we have been enhancing Mini Programs’ functionalities, in order to facilitate their discovery by users and 

the  development  process.  Mini  Programs  connect  users  across  a  wide  spectrum  of  online  and  offline  services 

including retail, eCommerce, lifestyle services, municipal services and games. In particular, Mini Games (a subset 

of Mini Programs) received a warm user reception following their launch in December 2017, further driving wide 

adoption of Mini Programs among users. As of January 2018, 580,000 Mini Programs were launched with over 

170 million DAU.

We continued to achieve solid growth across core business segments:

—  Online games: We sustained another year of strong growth in both smart phone and PC games. On the mobile 

front,  our  in-house  developed  MOBA  game,  Honour  of  Kings,  achieved  mass  adoption  and  became  the  most 

popular smart phone game in China in terms of DAU. It consistently ranked top in app stores’ grossing charts for 

China. We achieved some initial success with the launch of its overseas version, Arena of Valor, in South East Asia. 

We further strengthened our leadership as the preferred publishing partner in China for domestic and international 

smart phone game developers. Successfully launching several licensed role playing games enhanced our presence 

in this high-revenue game genre. We also diversified our smart phone game portfolio by launching strategy and 

car-racing titles. On PC, we solidified our leading position in 2017 against a challenging market environment. We 

strengthened  core  user  engagement  by  organizing  eSports  tournaments  and  live  streaming  activities.  Through 

attaining the PC publishing rights and mobile development rights for the popular survival shooter game “PUBG” in 

China, we are well-positioned to develop this emerging category of games during 2018, as evidenced by the late-

mover success of the mobile game PUBG: Exciting Battleground launched before Chinese New Year.

5

Annual Report 2017Chairman’s Statement—  Digital content: Tencent Video achieved rapid growth in traffic and paying users driven by the popularity of our 

exclusive drama series, movies and self-commissioned content. We became the leading video streaming platform 

in China with over 137 million mobile DAU during the fourth quarter and 56 million subscriptions as of the end of 

2017. In November, we successfully listed our online literature business, China Literature, on the Main Board of 

The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. China Literature operates one of the largest and most diverse libraries 

of online literary content in China. We remain its controlling shareholder and will continue to leverage its rich and 

diverse content library for exploring adaptation into other media formats. Tencent Music operates the three most 

popular music apps in China by DAU, namely QQ Music, Kugou and WeSing. It increased subscription revenues 

and achieved robust virtual gifting sales. In the area of news feed content and short video, we upgraded Tencent 

Open Media Platform to centralize the content library and facilitate content curation for distribution across  our 

news, browser and social properties.

—  Advertising:  For  social  and  others  advertising,  we  deployed  our  AI  technology  and  data  analysis  capabilities  to 

further strengthen the user targeting capabilities of our advertising platform, enabling our advertisers to achieve 

higher ROI and effectiveness. Catering to advertiser demand, we increased our ad load for Weixin Moments in 

certain first-tier cities and lowered the traffic threshold for advertisements in Weixin Official Accounts. The number 

of advertisers for social advertisements grew strongly, helped by our self-service platform and our partner platforms. 

For media advertising, the popularity of our original and licensed video content contributed to traffic growth, user 

engagement,  and  helped  to  attract  more  branding  and  sponsorship  advertisements.  We  have  completed  the 

revamp of our news feed advertising system and started to resume monetization at the end of 2017. To facilitate 

effective placement by advertisers, we launched a unified advertising platform which integrated the advertising 

inventory of all our news feed products.

—  Payment related services: We extended our leadership in mobile payment in terms of active user accounts and 

further  increased  our  presence  in  commercial  transactions.  For  social  transactions,  total  transaction  volume 

increased year-on-year and money transfers kept on growing while red envelope gifting volume decreased. For 

commercial  transactions,  our  offline  transaction  volume  more  than  doubled  year-on-year.  We  deepened  our 

relationships with key channel partners and empowered more small merchants with technologies to enhance their 

operational efficiency. Payment is also an important platform for upselling our Internet finance products. LiCaiTong, 

our  wealth  management  platform,  aggregated  more  than  RMB300  billion  assets  under  management  as  of  the 

end of January 2018. WeBank achieved rapid growth in its unsecured consumer loan business, Weilidai, which 

managed outstanding loans of over RMB100 billion as of the end of 2017 while maintaining a low non-performing 

loan ratio. In October 2017, we attained an insurance distribution license in China and started to partner  with 

insurance companies in offering customized insurance products.

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s Statement—  Cloud services:  Tencent  Cloud  continued  to  grow  rapidly  during  the  year.  We  maintained  our  leading  market 

position in cloud services verticals including online games and video cloud services. We deepened our penetration 

among the leading Internet industries with more key clients, and expanded our client base in cloud services for 

financial services and government sectors. Our sales, channel and big data capabilities enabled us to offer smart 

retail solutions targeted at supermarkets, department stores, and fast moving consumer goods companies.

We are committed to investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and applying AI technologies to our existing products, such 

as  performance  advertising  systems,  content  services  and  financial  services.  In  addition  to  these  core  business  use 

cases, we are deploying AI in new areas such as medical healthcare and translation. We launched an AI-empowered 

diagnostic medical imaging product called AI Medical Innovation System (“騰訊覓影”) which is now being deployed in 

close to 100 hospitals in China with accuracy rates of over 90% for diagnoses of esophageal cancer. Our AI Lab rolled 

out an AI-assisted translation software. In view of demand among traditional retailers to undergo digital transformation, 

we launched our smart retail strategy to empower offline retailers with our technological capabilities including payment, 

cloud, data analytics and AI technologies. We also provide traffic support to enable merchants access into our online 

user  base.  In  addition,  Weixin  Official  Accounts  and  Mini  Programs  can  act  as  CRM  systems  for  retailers  to  better 

connect with their customers.

2. 

Company Financial Performance

In fiscal year 2017

Operating profit grew by 61% year-on-year. Operating margin was 38%, up 1 percentage point from the previous year.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 74% year-on-year. Non-GAAP profit attributable  to 

equity holders of the Company increased by 43%. Free cash flow grew by 70%.

—  QQ:  Smart  device  MAU  was  up  by  1.7%  year-on-year  to  683.0  million  while  PCU,  including  PC  and  mobile, 

increased by 11.1% year-on-year to 270.8 million. Smart device MAU for users aged 21 years or below increased 

year-on-year and their time spent per user also increased, indicating higher stickiness among young users. We 

launched AI-enabled features designed to attract young users to create amusing photo-, audio- and video-based 

messages. During the Chinese New Year, we encouraged users to send short-form greeting videos for receiving red 

envelopes, and to personalize greetings with Chinese New Year-themed animation and background music.

—  Qzone:  Smart  device  MAU  was  down  9.1%  year-on-year  to  554.0  million.  Campus  Qzone  further  increased 

coverage in high schools and colleges.

—  Weixin and WeChat: Combined MAU was 988.6 million, representing year-on-year growth of 11.2%. Following the 

Chinese New Year, the combined MAU exceeded 1 billion. We fine-tuned the Weixin user interface to enable more 

prominent featuring of Mini Programs. The launch of Mini Games in the end of 2017 gained widespread attention 

and accelerated adoption among users.

1 

Since the first quarter of 2017, we have adjusted historical smart device QQ and Qzone MAU figures so as to include users who 

only participate in certain activities inside the QQ and Qzone applications, such as interest groups, listening to online music, 

or reading online literature. These changes had a relatively immaterial impact on the MAU count and growth rates, but we feel 

better reflect the broadening range of user activities within QQ.

8

Tencent Holdings LimitedChairman’s Statement 
 
Online Games

PC client games achieved approximately RMB12.8 billion revenues, representing 13% year-on-year revenue growth, 

mainly contributed by the increase in DnF and LoL. Active users declined due to the general user migration to mobile 

devices  while  revenues  were  impacted  by  reduced  item-sales  marketing  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017.  PC  game 

revenues are likely to remain under pressure in future quarters impacted by the mobile shift. We will continue to develop 

the PC game franchise by enhancing our core users’ engagement through organizing professional eSports tournaments, 

promoting breakout new games such as PUBG and Fortnite, and discovering innovative game titles such as Subnautica 

to strengthen our platform.

Smart phone games achieved approximately RMB16.9 billion revenues, up 59% year-on-year. The number of active 

users remained healthy while ARPU was down quarter-on-quarter. Our shooter game CFM rolled out a survival mode 

which greatly expanded its user base but with no immediate monetization. Several RPG games entered into the post-

launch user consolidation phase and their revenues reduced sequentially during the quarter. We have extended our 

leadership in smart phone games through the roll out of new game genres. We launched two PUBG mobile games - 

PUBG: Exciting Battleground, which has achieved by far the highest DAU within the survival shooter game genre, and 

PUBG: Full Ahead, which has attained solid DAU. Currently, we focus on user experience and are yet to monetize these 

games. In December, we launched QQ Speed Mobile, which achieved breakout success with over 20 million DAU and 

healthy monetization. Its successful launch illustrated our capability to create an original game IP, operate it successfully 

on PC, and then extend its success to mobile.

Digital Content

Total  fee-based  VAS  subscriptions  grew  by  22%  year-on-year  to  135  million,  primarily  driven  by  video  and  music 

streaming  services.  Tencent  Video  became  the  leading  online  video  platform  in  China  in  terms  of  mobile  DAU  and 

subscriptions. Our mobile video DAU increased by 44% year-on-year to 137 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 

and our subscriptions increased by 121% year-on-year to 56 million as of the end of 2017. Leveraging our diversified 

content strategy and proven operations expertise, we further grew our online video subscriptions to approximately 62.6 

million  as  of  the  end  of  February  2018.  Our  IP  portfolio  under  China  Literature  and  Tencent  Games  provides  a  rich 

source for adaptation of the quality content into video. We have accumulated an exclusive content library covering TV 

drama series, movies, variety shows, animation, documentaries and music programs. We are committed to investing in 

high quality content to solidify our position as the largest and most rapidly growing online video platform in China.

9

Annual Report 2017Chairman’s Statement 
 
Online Advertising

Our online advertising business achieved 49% year-on-year growth in revenues.

For media advertising, video revenues continued to demonstrate strong growth due to popular video content such as the 

self-commissioned HoK-themed variety show “王者出擊”, and selected drama series. News revenues decreased year-

on-year as we were still revamping the advertising system during the quarter. We have launched a unified advertisement 

placement platform for all news feed products.

For  social  and  others  advertising,  our  advertising  revenues  year-on-year  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  higher 

advertising  demand  due  to  the  enhanced  targeting  capability  of  our  platforms  and  an  expanded  advertiser  base 

leveraging our partner platforms. The sequential increase was mainly due to positive eCommerce seasonality. Advertising 

impressions also increased in Weixin Moments and Official Accounts, and on our mobile advertising network. We are 

now testing CPC-based advertising links in Official Accounts which connect users to advertisers’ Mini Programs.

Others

We recorded 121% year-on-year revenue growth for other businesses, which was primarily driven by the strong growth 

of payment related and cloud services. Commercial transaction volume of Weixin Pay continued to grow at a fast pace, 

driven by offline transaction volumes, which more than doubled year-on-year.

Tencent Cloud’s global infrastructure covered 21 regions and operated 36 availability zones in the world as of end of 

2017. While we maintained our leading position in verticals such as online games and video, we achieved rapid growth 

in the financial services industry through strategic partnerships with major banks and insurance clients. In addition, we 

offered smart retail solutions targeting supermarkets, department stores and fast moving consumer goods companies.

4. 

Company Outlook and Strategies for 2018

Looking forward, we will more aggressively invest to strengthen our long-term competitive positions in areas including 

online video, payment services, cloud services, AI technologies and smart retail. Our development initiatives include:

— 

Strengthening our social platforms to encourage user sharing, enhance connections with users’ daily lives  and 

facilitate interactions with ecosystem partners;

— 

Enhancing the popularity of our games through upgrading the content of our existing titles and adding innovative 

new titles;

—  Revenues from our VAS business increased by 43% to RMB154.0 billion for the year ended 31 December 2017 on a 

year-on-year basis. Online games revenues grew by 38% to RMB97,883 million. The increase was primarily driven by 

revenue growth from our smart phone games, including existing titles such as Honour of Kings, and new titles such as 

the China version of Contra Return, Dragon Nest Mobile and Legacy TLBB Mobile. Revenues from our PC client games, 

such as DnF and LoL, also contributed to the increase. Social networks revenues increased by 52% to RMB56,100

Revenues. Revenues increased by 2% to RMB66,392 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

—  Revenues from our VAS business decreased by 5% to RMB39,947 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Online games 

revenues decreased by 9% to RMB24,367 million. The decrease mainly reflected a high base for PC games driven by 

item-sales promotion activities in the third quarter of 2017, decreased revenues from RPG and shooter genre  smart 

phone games, as well as the timing of new RPG smart phone game releases and of new content for certain other smart 

phone games. Social networks revenues increased by 2% to RMB15,580 million. The increase was primarily driven by 

revenue growth from our digital content services such as subscription video streaming and live broadcast, partially offset 

by reduced in-game virtual item sales.

—  Revenues  from  our  online  advertising  business  increased  by  12%  to  RMB12,361  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of 

2017. Media advertising revenues were RMB4,121 million, broadly stable compared to last quarter. Social and others 

advertising  revenues  grew  by  19%  to  RMB8,240  million,  mainly  driven  by  higher  advertising  revenues  derived  from 

Weixin and from our advertising network, in turn benefiting from the positive seasonality of eCommerce promotional 

activities in the fourth quarter. 4

—  Revenues from our other businesses increased by 17% to RMB14,084 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily 

due to our payment related and cloud services.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 4% to RMB34,897 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 on a quarter-on-

quarter basis. The increase primarily reflected greater costs of payment related services, higher traffic acquisition costs, as well 

as higher bandwidth and server custody fees. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 53% for the fourth 

quarter of 2017 from 51% for the third quarter of 2017.

— 

Cost  of  revenues  for  our  VAS  business  decreased  by  4%  to  RMB16,268  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017.  The 

decrease mainly reflected lower content and channel costs, reflecting the timing of new content for our subscription 

video streaming services and fluctuation in licensed game revenues.

Annual Report 2017Management Discussion and Analysis— 

Cost of revenues for our online advertising business increased by 10% to RMB7,759 million for the fourth quarter of 

2017.  The  increase  was  mainly  driven  by  greater  traffic  acquisition  costs  due  to  the  rapid  growth  of  our  advertising 

network business.

— 

Cost of revenues for our other businesses increased by 13% to RMB10,870 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The 

growth was mainly due to the increased scale of our payment related and cloud services.

Selling and marketing expenses.  Selling  and  marketing  expenses  increased  by  25%  to  RMB6,022  million  for  the  fourth 

quarter of 2017 on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The increase was mainly driven by higher marketing spending on products and 

platforms such as payment related services and online media, as well as seasonal marketing and promotion activities for our 

online games.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3% to RMB8,811 million for the 

fourth quarter of 2017 on a quarter-on-quarter basis, primarily reflecting the true-up of our bonus forecast at year end.

Share of (loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures. We recorded share of losses of associates and joint ventures of RMB120 

million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to share of profit of RMB818 million for the third quarter of 2017. The change 

mainly reflected the absence of one-off gains which certain investee companies booked in the third quarter of 2017.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased by 37% to RMB3,123 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 on a quarter-

on-quarter basis. The decrease primarily reflected a reversal of income tax expense for our certain subsidiaries in China which 

were qualified in the fourth quarter of 2017 to enjoy a lower CIT rate.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company. Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by 16% to 

RMB20,797 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Non-GAAP profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company increased by 2% to RMB17,454 million.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the consolidated results of the Group prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain additional non-GAAP financial 

measures (in terms of, operating profit, operating margin, profit for the period, net margin, profit attributable to equity holders 

of the Company, basic EPS and diluted EPS), have been presented in this annual report. These unaudited non-GAAP financial 

measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Group’s financial performance prepared 

in accordance with IFRS. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from similar terms used 

by other companies.

The  Company’s  management  believes  that  the  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplementary 

information to assess the performance of the Group’s core operations by excluding certain non-cash items and certain impact 

of M&A transactions. In addition, non-GAAP adjustments include relevant non-GAAP adjustments for the Group’s material 

associates based on available published financials of the relevant material associates, or estimates made by the Company’s 

management based on available information, certain expectations, assumptions and premises.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had net cash of RMB16,332 million. The sequential decline primarily reflected payments 

for M&A initiatives, partly offset by free cash flow generation. Fair value of our stakes in listed investee companies (including 

both  associates  and  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  but  excluding  our  stakes  in  subsidiaries  such  as  China  Literature) 

totalled RMB210.8 billion as at 31 December 2017, compared to RMB171.1 billion as at 30 September 2017.

As at 31 December 2017, RMB45,530 million of our financial resources (cash and cash equivalents, as well as term deposits 

and others, such as treasury investments with high liquidity) were denominated in non-RMB currencies.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017,  the  Group  had  free  cash  flow  of  RMB24,170  million.  This  was  a  result  of  net  cash  flow 

generated from operating activities of RMB28,594 million, offset by payments for capital expenditure of RMB4,424 million.

Tencent Holdings LimitedDirectors’ Report 
CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Reference is made to the waiver granted by the Stock Exchange regarding the compliance with the applicable disclosure, 

reporting and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules when the Company was listed in 

June 2004.

The reasons for using Structure Contracts

Current PRC laws and regulations limit foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China. As foreign-invested enterprises, the WFOEs do not have licences to provide Internet content or information services and 

other telecommunications value-added services. Accordingly, the value-added telecommunications business of the Group has 

been conducted through Tencent Computer, Shiji Kaixuan and the new operating companies (the “New OPCOs”) (collectively, 

the “OPCOs”) by itself or through their subsidiaries under the Structure Contracts (as defined in the section “Our History and 

Structure – Structure Contracts” of the IPO prospectus of the Company). As a result of the Structure Contracts, the Group is 

able to recognise and receive the economic benefit of the business and operations of the OPCOs. The Structure Contracts are 

also designed to provide the Company with effective control over and (to the extent permitted by PRC law) the right to acquire 

the equity interests in and/or assets of the OPCOs.

For a summary of the major terms of the Structure Contracts, please refer to the sections headed “Our History and Structure” 

and “Structure Contracts” in the IPO prospectus. During the year ended 31 December 2017, there was no material change 

in the Structure Contracts and/or the circumstances under which they were adopted, and none of the Structure Contracts has

Annual Report 2017Directors’ Report Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) as at 31 December 

2017

Requirements related to Structure Contracts (other than relevant foreign ownership restrictions) include the Notice on Further 

Strengthening the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games and the Examination and Approval  of 

Imported  Online  Games  (關於貫徹落實國務院《“三定”規定》和中央編辦有關解釋,進一步加強網絡遊戲前置審批和進口

網絡遊戲審批管理的通知)  (the  “Circular  13”)  jointly  issued  by  PRC  General  Administration  of  Press  and  Publication,  the 

National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications in September 

2009 provides that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating businesses in the PRC via wholly 

owned, equity joint venture or co-operative joint venture investments and further expressly prohibits foreign investors from 

gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing other joint 

venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements with the Chinese licence holders.

However, Circular 13 does not provide any interpretation of the term “foreign investors” or make a distinction between foreign 

online game companies and companies under a corporate structure similar to the Group. Thus, it is unclear whether the State 

General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television will deem the Group’s structure and operations to be 

in violation of these provisions.

In  the  view  of  the  Company’s  PRC  legal  advisers,  the  arrangement  of  the  Structure  Contracts  does  not  violate  applicable 

existing PRC laws and regulations as the Company indirectly operates the value-added telecommunication service business, 

online games, online advertising and other Internet and wireless portals in the PRC through affiliated OPCOs that hold the 

necessary licences for the existing lines of businesses.

However, the Company’s PRC legal advisers also advised that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation 

and application of the currently applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and 

PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the position of the Company’s PRC legal advisers concerning the 

Structure Contracts.

65

Annual Report 2017Directors’ Report The risks associated with Structure Contracts and the actions taken by the Company to mitigate the risks

Due to regulatory limitations restricting foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunications services in 

China, the Company conducts some of its business in the PRC through the OPCOs. These contractual arrangements may not 

be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. Pursuant to the Structure Contracts, the arbitration tribunal is entitled 

to decide compensation for the equity interests or property ownership of OPCOs, decide to implement enforceable remedy 

(including mandatorily requiring OPCOs to transfer the equity interests of OPCOs to the WFOEs, etc.) or order the bankruptcy of 

OPCOs. Prior to the formation of the arbitration tribunal, the courts of the places where the major assets of OPCOs are situated 

are entitled to implement interim remedies to ensure the enforcement of the future decisions of the arbitration tribunals.

The WFOEs have been structured and located in order to benefit from preferential tax treatments offered to companies located 

in designated economic zones and/or operating software-related businesses. Although the relevant governmental authority has 

granted such preferential tax treatment to certain WFOEs and OPCOs, there can be no assurance that the conditions under 

which  these  treatments  are  provided  will  always  be  present.  The  relevant  WFOEs  and  OPCOs  would  use  their  reasonable 

endeavours to take all necessary actions, including but not limited to maintaining or acquiring their status as “High and New 

Technology Enterprise” or “National Key Software Enterprise”, in order to continue to enjoy the reduced income tax rate and 

the other tax concessions.

Due  to  the  legal  constraints  in  relation  to  foreign  investment  in  the  telecommunications  value-added  services  industry  in 

the PRC, a number of agreements have been entered into between members of the Group whereby the Company and the 

WFOEs derive substantially all their revenues from transactions with the OPCOs. The recognition of revenues outlined in these 

intragroup contracts could be challenged by tax authorities and any adjustment in tax treatment could have a material and 

adverse impact on the taxable profitability of the Group. As advised by the Company’s PRC legal advisers, it is unlikely that the 

tax treatment of revenues will be challenged by the PRC tax authorities, provided that the transactions under these intra-group 

contracts represent bona fide transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis. The Company will take all necessary actions to 

ensure and monitor that relevant transactions are to be conducted on an arm’s length basis to minimise the risks of adjustment 

in tax treatment.

For details of the risks associated with the Structure Contracts, please refer to the section headed “Risk factors – Risks relating 

to our structure” in the IPO prospectus.

Other connected transactions

Save as the related parties transaction disclosed in Note 13(a) (Senior management’s emoluments), Note 13(b) (Five highest 

paid individuals), Note 14 (Benefits and interests of directors), Note 20 (Transactions with associates), Note 25 (Loans  to 

investees  and  investees’  shareholders)  and  Note  33  (Share-based  payments)  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  no 

related parties transactions disclosed in the consolidated financial statements constitutes a discloseable connected transaction 

as defined under the Listing Rules. The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements set out in Chapter 14A of the 

Listing Rules.

Annual Report 2017Directors’ Report Maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical business practices are core values of the Group. The 

Board views effective corporate governance practices as a priority of the Group, with the aim of providing our investors with a 

thorough understanding of the Group’s management and how such management oversees and manages different businesses 

of the Group. Our belief is that investors will realise significant long-term value when the Group’s businesses are conducted 

in an open and responsible manner. Ethical business practices go hand in hand with strong corporate governance, and we 

believe that running our businesses in an ethical manner will lead to public trust and will ultimately create shareholder value 

for the Group.

To  better  serve  the  long  term  interests  of  our  stakeholders,  the  Board  delegates  certain  matters  requiring  particular  time, 

attention and expertise to its committees. The Board has determined that these matters are better dealt with by the committees 

as they require independent oversight and specialist input. As such, the Board has established five committees to assist the 

Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. Each of the committees has its terms of reference which clearly specify its powers and authorities. All committees 

report back to the Board and make recommendations to the Board if necessary.

The Company’s governance structure of these committees can be summarised as follows:

Audit Committee

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

handles the relationship with the Company’s external auditor;

reviews the Company’s financial information;

exercises oversight of the Company’s financial reporting system;

reviews the work done by the Company’s management with respect to risk management and internal control systems; 

and

oversees the risks undertaken by the Company including determining the level of risk the Company expects to and is 

able to take.

74

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportThe major work of the committees during the year 2017 is set out on pages 80 to 83.

All directors have full and timely access to all relevant information as well as the advice and services of the Company’s general 

counsel and the company secretary, with a view to ensuring that Board procedures and all applicable rules and regulations 

are followed. All directors may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for carrying out their 

functions.

We believe education and training are important for maintaining an effective Board. New directors undergo an orientation 

programme  designed  to  provide  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  businesses,  and  also  receive  a 

handbook  outlining  their  responsibilities  under  the  Listing  Rules  and  applicable  laws.  Existing  directors  are  provided  with 

tailored  training  programmes  covering  topics  such  as  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  legal  and  regulatory  trends 

and,  given  the  nature  of  our  business,  emerging  technologies  and  products.  Directors  also  regularly  meet  with  the  senior 

management team to understand the Group’s businesses, governance policies and regulatory environment. During the year 

ended 31 December 2017, the Company arranged training on topics relating to corporate governance, legal and regulatory 

updates and product trends which are relevant to the Group’s businesses. The chart below summarises the participation of 

each of the directors in continuous professional development during the year ended 31 December 2017:

Maintaining a high level of corporate governance and integrity cannot depend solely on the Board’s efforts; each of the Group’s 

employees is also required to contribute to such cause. A code of conduct policy with an emphasis on integrity and respect is 

distributed by the Company to all employees and forms part of their employment agreements.

75

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportIn  addition,  the  Board  has  adopted  various  practices  to  bring  the  Group  to  a  high  level  of  corporate  governance  and 

compliance with the CG Code.

To stay abreast of the high level of corporate governance and maintain transparency of our corporate governance practices, we 

have continued to adopt and foster the following corporate governance practices:

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

‧ 

review of the shareholders communication policy has been and will be conducted on a regular basis;

training has been and will continue to be provided to directors on a timely basis, including briefing the directors on any 

updates to the Listing Rules and relevant laws;

the company secretary attends training in compliance with the Listing Rules requirements; and

informal  updates  from  time  to  time  and  structured  monthly  updates  on  the  Company’s  performance,  position  and 

prospects are provided to the directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Mr Ma Huateng serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This is at variance with code provision 

A.2.1 of the CG Code, which provides that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separate and should not be 

performed by the same individual. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive should be clearly 

established and set out in writing.

In view of the ever-changing business environment in which our Group operates, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

must be technically sophisticated and sensitive to fast and rapid market changes, including changes in users’ preferences, 

in order to promote the different businesses of the Group. The Board thus considers that a segregation of the roles of the 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may create unnecessary costs for the daily operation of the Group.

Besides, all major decisions have been made in consultation with members of the Board and appropriate committees, as well 

as the senior management team. Chief officers and senior executives are invited to attend Board meetings from time to time to 

make presentations and answer Board’s enquiries. In addition, directors are encouraged to participate actively in all Board and 

committee meetings of which they are members, and the Chairman ensures that all issues raised are properly briefed at the 

Board meetings, and he works with the senior management team to provide adequate, accurate, clear, complete and reliable 

information to members of the Board in a timely manner. Further, the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available for 

discussion for all items at the Board meetings. During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Chairman held a meeting with 

the non-executive directors (including the independent non-executive directors) without the presence of the executive directors 

as required by the Listing Rules.

The Board is therefore of the view that there is an adequate balance of power and that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

Nevertheless, the Board will continue to regularly monitor and review the Company’s current structure and to make necessary 

changes when appropriate.

76

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportComposition

As at the date of this annual report, the Board is comprised of eight directors, with two executive directors, two non-executive 

directors and four independent non-executive directors. During the year ended 31 December 2017 and up to the date of this 

annual report, there is no change to the composition of the Board.

A list of directors and their respective biographies are set out on pages 48 to 51 of this annual report.

In order to take advantage of the skills, experiences and diversity of perspectives of the directors and in order to ensure that the 

directors give sufficient time and attention to the Group’s affairs, we request each of the directors to disclose to the Company, 

on a quarterly basis, the number and the nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant 

commitments. The Board’s composition is in compliance with the requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules that 

the number of independent non-executive directors must represent at least one-third of the Board. The Board believes that 

the balance between the executive directors and the non-executive directors is reasonable and adequate to provide sufficient 

checks and balances that safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group.

The Board values the importance of professional judgment and advice provided by non-executive directors to safeguard the 

interests of the shareholders. The non-executive directors contribute diversified qualifications and experience to the Group by 

expressing their views in professional, constructive and informed manner, and actively participate in Board and committee 

meetings and to bring professional judgment and advice on issues relating to the Group’s strategies, policies, performance, 

accountability,  resources,  key  appointments,  standards  of  conduct,  conflicts  of  interests  and  management  process,  with 

the  shareholders’  interests  being  the  utmost  important  factor.  The  non-executive  directors  also  exercise  their  professional 

judgment and utilise their expertise to scrutinise the Company’s performance in achieving agreed corporate goals, and monitor 

performance reporting.

Further,  in  compliance  with  Rule  3.10  of  the  Listing  Rules,  two  of  our  independent  non-executive  directors  have  the 

appropriate professional qualifications of accounting or related financial management expertise, and provide valuable advice 

from time to time to the Board. The Company has also received from each independent non-executive director a confirmation 

annually  of  his  independence  and  the  Nomination  Committee  has  conducted  an  annual  review  and  considers  that  all 

independent non-executive directors are independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 3.13 

of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director.

As part of our corporate governance practice to provide transparency to the investor community and in compliance with the 

Listing Rules and the CG Code, independent non-executive directors are identified as such in all corporate communications 

containing  the  names  of  the  directors.  In  addition,  an  updated  list  of  directors  identifying  the  independent  non-executive 

directors  and  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  directors  is  maintained  on  the  Company  Website  and  the  Stock  Exchange’s 

website.

77

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportAppointments, Re-election and Removal

The Board is the core of the Group’s success, and with the appropriate composition of the Board, we can benefit from the right 

set of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives to take the Company forward. Therefore, it is essential for the Company to 

maintain a formal, considered and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. It is our corporate 

governance practice and in accordance with the Articles of Association that all directors (except for the Chairman) should be 

subject to re-election at regular intervals and the resignation and removal of any director should be explained with reasons. In 

the 2017 annual general meeting, Messrs Lau Chi Ping Martin and Charles St Leger Searle retired and were re-elected, and Mr 

Yang Siu Shun was re-elected in accordance with Article 86(3) of the Articles of Association.

Code provision A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that all directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy should be subject to election 

by shareholders at the first general meeting after appointment. Every director, including those appointed for a specific term, 

should be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.

The Chairman, in accordance with the Articles of Association, whilst holding such office is not subject to retirement by rotation 

nor taken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Therefore, there is a deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code. The Chairman is one of the founders of the Group and he plays a key role in the growth and 

development of the Group and his continuing presence in the Board is vital to the sustainable development of the Group. Given 

the importance of the Chairman’s role in the development of the Group, the Board considers that the deviation from code 

provision A.4.2 of the CG Code has no material impact on the operation of the Group as a whole.

At the Board meetings, the Board discussed a wide range of matters, including the Group’s overall strategies, financial and 

operational  performances,  approved  the  annual,  interim  and  quarterly  results  of  the  Group,  the  appointment  of  directors, 

business prospects, regulatory compliance and corporate governance, and other significant matters. The company secretary, 

in consultation with the Chairman and the senior management team, prepares the agenda for each meeting and all directors 

are  given  the  opportunity  to  include  matters  for  discussion  in  the  agenda.  The  company  secretary  also  ensures  that  all 

applicable rules and regulations in relation to the Board meetings are followed. The company secretary sends notice of the 

Board meeting to each of the directors at least 14 days in advance of each regular Board meeting. The company secretary 

also sends the agenda, board papers and relevant information relating to the Group to each of the directors at least 3 days in 

advance of each regular Board meeting and committee meeting, and keeps the directors updated on the Group’s financial 

performance and latest developments. If any director raises any queries, steps will be taken to respond to such queries as 

promptly and fully as possible. If there is potential or actual conflict of interests involving a substantial shareholder or a director, 

such director will declare his interest and will abstain from voting on such matters. The directors may approach the Company’s 

senior management team when necessary. The directors may also seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 

expense in appropriate circumstances.

79

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportThe  company  secretary  ensures  that  there  is  a  good  and  timely  flow  of  information  to  the  Board.  The  company  secretary 

is  responsible  for  taking  minutes  of  all  Board  and  committee  meetings  and  ensuring  that  sufficient  details  of  the  matters 

considered and decisions reached have been recorded. Draft and final version of the minutes of meetings are sent to the 

directors  for  comments  and  records  respectively  within  a  reasonable  time  after  each  meeting,  and  final  minutes  with  the 

relevant board papers and related materials are kept by the company secretary and are available for review and inspection by 

the directors at any time.

THE COMMITTEES

As described above, the Board has established five committees, each of which has been delegated responsibilities and reports 

back to the Board: Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee, Nomination Committee and 

Remuneration Committee. The roles and functions of these committees are set out in their respective terms of reference. The 

terms of reference of each of these committees will be revised from time to time to ensure that they continue to meet the needs 

of the Company and to ensure compliance with the CG Code. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Nomination 

Committee and the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company Website and the Stock Exchange’s website.

PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) is the Group’s external auditor. The Audit Committee annually reviews the relationship of 

the Company with PwC. Having also reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process as well as the independence and 

objectivity of PwC, the Audit Committee is satisfied with this relationship. As such, the Audit Committee has recommended 

their re-appointment at the 2018 AGM.

Corporate Governance Committee

The Corporate Governance Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Charles St Leger Searle 

(non-executive director), Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce, Mr Ian Charles Stone and Mr Yang Siu Shun (all of them are independent

81

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportNomination Committee

The Nomination Committee comprises a majority of independent non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ma Huateng, 

Mr Li Dong Sheng, Mr Iain Ferguson Bruce, Mr Ian Charles Stone (all three are independent non-executive directors) and Mr 

Charles St Leger Searle (non-executive director). The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Ma Huateng.

The Nomination Committee met once in 2017. Individual attendance of each Nomination Committee member is set out on

During 2017, the Nomination Committee reviewed board composition and director succession, and the board diversity policy, 

and also considered and made recommendations to the Board on the re-appointment of the retiring directors at the 2017 

annual general meeting. The Nomination Committee has also assessed the independence of the independent non-executive 

directors and considers all of them to be independent, taking into account of the independence guidelines set out in Rule 

3.13 of the Listing Rules in the context of the length of service of each independent non-executive director. The Company 

recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, and views diversity at Board level as a business imperative that will help 

the Company achieve its strategic objectives and maintain a competitive advantage. As such, the Board has set measurable 

objectives for the implementation of the board diversity policy to ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, 

experience and diversity of perspectives that are required to support the execution of its business strategy and maintain the 

effectiveness of the Board. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that the board diversity policy is successfully implemented 

with reference to the measurable objectives. The Nomination Committee will continue to monitor the implementation of the 

board diversity policy and will review the board diversity policy periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Mr Ian Charles Stone, Mr Li Dong 

Sheng (both are independent non-executive directors) and Mr Jacobus Petrus (Koos) Bekker (non-executive director). The 

Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Ian Charles Stone.

The Remuneration Committee met three times in 2017. Individual attendance of each Remuneration Committee member is 

set out on page 79.

The Remuneration Committee has the delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration packages of each member of 

the senior management team and make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of each director.

The Remuneration Committee’s major work during the year 2017 includes the following:

‧ 

reviewing and recommending to the Board in respect of the remuneration policies and structure of the Company by 

benchmarking peer companies with a similar scale to ensure that the Company’s remuneration packages are competitive 

to recruit the best talents in the industry and to retain key staff;

‧ 

‧ 

reviewing and recommending to the Board on the remuneration packages for the directors;

assessing performance and, reviewing and approving amendments to the remuneration packages for the members of

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report‧ 

‧ 

reviewing and approving compensation awards granted to senior management team, to recognise their contributions to 

the Company and to provide incentives for future performances; and

reviewing and endorsing the proposed adoption of the new share option schemes.

In conducting its work in relation to the remuneration of directors and senior management team, the Remuneration Committee 

ensured that no individual or any of his associates was involved in determining his own remuneration. It also ensured that 

remuneration awards were determined by reference to the performance of the individual and the Company and were aligned to 

the market practice and conditions, the Company’s goals and strategies. They are designed to attract, retain and motivate high 

performing individuals, and reflect the specifics of individual roles.

In respect of non-executive directors, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fees payable to them taking into account 

the particular nature of their duties, relevant guidance available and the requirements of the Listing Rules.

ACCOUNTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of the Board’s responsibility, the Board ensures that a balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s performance and 

prospects is presented. The directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the accounts that give a true and 

fair view of the Group’s financial position on a going-concern basis and other announcements and financial disclosures. To 

assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities, the senior management team provides updates to the Board from time to 

time, including the Group’s business and financial position in sufficient detail, to give the directors a balanced, understandable 

and clear assessment of the performance, position and prospects of the Group. The senior management team also provides 

all  necessary  and  relevant  information  to  the  Board,  giving  the  directors  sufficient  explanation  and  information  they  need 

to discharge their responsibilities and make an informed assessment of financial and other information put before them for 

approval. The Company auditor’s statement in respect of their reporting responsibilities is set out in the “Independent Auditor’s 

Report”.

Adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  key  to  safeguarding  the  achievement  of  the 

Company’s business strategies. The risk management and internal control systems shall also ensure the achievement of the 

Company’s objectives in operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable 

laws, regulations and policies.

The  Board  acknowledges  that  it  is  the  Board’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  Company  has  established  and  maintained 

adequate  and  effective  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  Board  delegates  its  responsibility  to  the  Audit 

Committee to review the practices of management with respect to risk management and internal control, including the design, 

implementation and supervision of the risk management and internal control systems. This review formally takes place on a 

quarterly basis. The Audit Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems on an 

annual basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the risk appetite of the Company including determining the risk level the 

Company expects and is able to take, and proactively considering, analysing and formulating strategies to manage the key risks 

that the Company is exposed to.

83

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportTo  ensure  that  the  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems  are  effective,  the  Company,  under  the  supervision  and 

guidance of the Board and factoring the actual needs of the Company, has adopted the “Three Lines of Defence” internal 

monitoring model as an official organisational structure for risk management and internal control.

The First Line of Defence -- Operation and Management

The  First  Line  of  Defence  is  mainly  formed  by  the  business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  of  the 

Company who are responsible for the day-to-day operation and management. It is responsible for designing and implementing 

controls to address the risks.

The Second Line of Defence -- Risk Management

The Second Line of Defence is mainly the IC. This line of defence is responsible for formulating policies related to the risk 

management and internal control of the Company and for planning and implementing the establishment of integrated risk 

control systems. For ensuring effective implementation of such systems, this line of defence also assists and supervises the 

first line of defence in the establishment and improvement of risk management and internal control systems.

The Third Line of Defence -- Independent Assurance

The Third Line of Defence mainly consists of the functions of internal audit and anti-fraud investigation under the IA.

The IA holds a high degree of independence and is responsible for providing an independent evaluation on the effectiveness 

of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems, and monitoring management’s continuous improvement over 

the risk management and internal control areas.

The  anti-fraud  investigation  function  is  responsible  for  receiving  whistleblower  reports  through  various  channels  and  for 

following up and investigating alleged fraudulent activities. It also assists management in promoting the “Tencent Sunshine 

Code  of  Conduct”  (the  “Sunshine  Code”)  and  the  value  of  integrity  to  all  employees  of  the  Company.  The  IA  has  direct 

reporting lines to the Audit Committee.

These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 

provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The  Board  and  management  have  always  attached  significance  to  the  Company’s  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems. In 2017, the Company has invested even more resources in the continuous improvement of the risk management 

and internal control systems, which have also increased the awareness of risk management among the employees. The internal 

control function has continuously worked closely with and provided proactive supports to the business groups in their business 

development and risk management. Furthermore, the IA has also continued to promote the deployment of continuous audits 

to provide more effective and timely independent evaluations. The connection and interaction among the three lines of defence 

have been further strengthened to have more positive supports to the Company.

84

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance ReportRisk Management

The Company is committed to continuously improving the risk management system, including structure, process and culture, 

through  the  enhancement  of  risk  management  ability,  to  ensure  long-term  growth  and  sustainable  development  of  the 

Company’s business.

The Company has established a risk management system (including the “Three Lines of Defence” internal monitoring model 

as detailed above) which sets out the roles and responsibilities of each relevant party as well as the relevant risk management 

policies and processes. Each business group of the Company, on a regular basis, identifies and assesses risk factors that may 

negatively impact the achievement of its objectives, and formulates appropriate response measures. The Company’s staff also 

attends training in relation to risk management and internal controls on a regular basis.

Risk Management Process

Being  an  Internet  company  with  a  wide  variety  of  rapidly-changing  businesses,  the  Company  has  adopted  the  following 

dynamic risk management process in response to the ever-changing risk landscape:

‧  Business  and  functional  departments  of  each  business  group  identify,  assess  and  respond  to  risks  in  the  course  of 

operation in a systematic manner, escalating concerns and communicating results to the IC;

‧ 

The IC collects, analyses and consolidates a list of significant risks at the company level, and provides input on risk 

response  strategies  and  control  measures  for  such  risks.  These  significant  risks  as  well  as  the  corresponding  risk 

responses  and  control  measures  will  be  reviewed  by  senior  management  and  subsequently  by  the  Audit  Committee 

before reporting to the Board;

The IC reviews and evaluates the responses to significant risks from time to time, and reports to the Audit Committee at 

least once a year; and

The  Audit  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  assesses  and  determines  the  nature  and  level  of  the  risks  that  the 

Company is willing to take in order to achieve its business objectives and formulates appropriate response strategies 

which include designating responsible departments for handling each significant risk. The Audit Committee provides 

guidance to the Company’s management to implement effective risk management system with supports from the IC.

Significant Risks of the Company

In 2017, management has identified and determined eight significant risks of the Company through the risk management 

process detailed above. Comparing with 2016, “2B business risk” and “Crisis management and reputation risk” are the two 

additional risks identified and disclosed as significant risks of the Company in 2017. As the Company’s business scale, scope 

and complexity have evolved, so does its external environment, management considers that the Company is still facing the 

six significant risks disclosed in 2016 - the business continuity risk stays at the similar level as last year while the other risks 

increased in different degrees.

85

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportOn  behalf  of  the  Board,  the  Audit  Committee  assists  the  Board  in  supervising  the  overall  risk  status  of  the  Company 

and  evaluating  the  change  in  the  nature  and  severity  of  the  Company’s  major  risks.  The  Audit  Committee  considers  that 

management has taken appropriate measures to address and manage the significant risks that they are responsible for at a 

level acceptable to the Board.

Below is a summary of the significant risks of the Company along with the applicable response strategies. The Company’s risk 

profile may change and the list below is not intended to be exhaustive.

1.  Market competition and innovation risk

The Internet industry is highly competitive, innovative and ever-changing. The cross-sectoral expansion of non-internet 

companies  adds  more  new  participants  to  the  market.  The  users’  desire  for  innovative  products  and  service  is  also 

increasing. Therefore, to attract new users while maintaining its existing market share is still one of the challenges of the 

Company. The lack of innovation or slow innovation in technology and product would impair the core competitiveness of 

the Company.

The Company stays on top of the industry trends, keeps track of the development of new technologies and stays relevant 

through  innovation.  The  Company  focuses  on  changes  in  user  experience,  and  continuously  recruits  more  talents, 

enhances its technical capabilities and innovation environment to develop products that meet the expectations of the 

market. The Company leverages the strength of the existing platforms to seek better business partners for exploration 

of new business opportunities and better responding to the market needs. The Company has established a number of 

open platforms with the aim to promote “mutual benefit and win-win” concept, and to strengthen the cooperation with 

its business partners. For example, “Double Hundred Plan” of Tencent Westart Space, which incubates potential startup 

companies, has enhanced its collaboration with business partners and its competitiveness in the market.

2.  2B business risk

With  the  rapid  development  of  the  2B  business  of  the  Company,  if  the  Company  fails  to  optimise  its  organisational 

structure with support from professional talents to quickly explore new business operating and management models, and 

improve its cooperation mechanisms with various business partners, it may affect the continuous healthy development of 

the 2B business.

The Company is accumulating and solidifying its experience in the 2B business. The Company has been proactively 

responding  to  the  challenges  by  optimising  its  organisational  structure  and  resource  allocation,  recruiting  more 2B 

business professional talents and setting up appropriate mechanisms to ensure the effective operation of 2B business for 

rapid and sustained development.

86

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report3.  Business continuity risk

The stability of servers and network infrastructure for products and platforms of the Company is of vital importance for 

the successful operation of the Company’s business as well as the provision of high quality user experience. Any material 

functional  defect,  interruption,  breakdown  or  other  issue  in  connection  is  likely  to  materially  adversely  impact  the 

Company’s businesses.

The  Company  has  been  continuously  investing  in  the  infrastructure  for  products  and  platforms  of  the  Company  to 

enhance its disaster recovery capability in order to provide stable support to the business development. Various business 

departments are also engaged in emergency procedures to ensure the smooth operation of the Company’s businesses. 

In addition, the Company has established dedicated teams to develop business contingency plans and perform periodic 

drills on the plans to ensure their effectiveness.

4.  Acquisition and investment management risk

With the Company’s increased investment activities, it is important for the Company to adopt robust procedures in the 

formulation of investment strategies and strong treasury management, both at the investment evaluation stage as well 

as the post-investment stage. Failure to promptly manage investment risks could hinder the realization of investment 

strategies.

The  Company  takes  the  management  of  investment  risks  seriously,  and  has,  amongst  other  things,  established  an 

Investment Committee under the Board, dedicated an investment team to identify investment opportunities, appointed 

finance,  legal  and  other  relevant  professional  teams  to  manage  relevant  risks  and  put  in  place  the  investment  risk 

evaluation  and  approval  process.  There  is  also  a  designated  professional  team  that  regularly  reviews  the  Company’s 

cash position and, continuously expands its financing channels and capabilities to meet the needs from the Company’s 

business  operations  as  well  as  acquisitions.  The  Company  has  also  designated  finance,  legal  and  other  relevant 

professional  teams  to  support  and  monitor  the  performance  of  the  investee  companies.  These  teams  periodically 

analyse and review relevant operating and financial information of the investee companies to ensure that they continue 

to satisfy the Company’s investment strategies. Furthermore, the Company has strengthened its IT system development 

to enhance the transparency of the management process, analyse key information of investment companies in a timely 

manner, and make/take more timely and effective management decisions and actions. In addition, the Company has 

invested resources in internal audit and internal control to support the management of its controlling subsidiaries  in 

establishing more sound risk management and internal control systems.

5. 

Information security risk

Protecting  user  data  is  the  top  priority  of  the  Company,  and  the  Company  is  fully  aware  that  any  loss  or  leakage  of 

sensitive user information could have a significant negative impact on affected users and the Company’s reputation, even 

lead to potential legal action against the Company.

87

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportThe Company is obliged to protect sensitive user information and as such, the Company strives to provide the highest 

level of protection to such data. In this regard, the Company has formulated policies and control measures to protect 

user data. Information security is ensured through effective management systems, encryption, access restrictions and 

process protocols. In addition, the Company performs review periodically and engages independent specialists to review 

the Company’s data protection practices and provides training programmes to employees to enhance their awareness of 

information security.

6.  Governance policies and regulations risk

Although the Internet and technology industry is still evolving, regulatory authorities in numerous jurisdictions have been, 

in an attempt to keep up with such evolution, developing more comprehensive and stringent regulations to regulate the 

industry. As the Company is continuously expanding its businesses in the PRC and overseas, it is required to comply 

with the new applicable laws and regulations in different jurisdictions that are specifically relevant to the Company’s 

businesses, such as laws relating to data protection, Internet information security, IP, gaming and Internet finance.

The Company has set up several professional departments and teams that work closely with management of business 

groups  to  monitor  and  identify  changes  in  any  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  so  as  to  take  appropriate  actions  or 

measures to ensure the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the Company also 

actively exchanges view and information with relevant regulatory authorities on the trend and development of Internet 

industry.

7.  Social responsibility risk

With the diverse products and platforms of the Company and its expanding user base, the products and platforms of the 

Company have gained considerable influence in wider society. The Company’s products and platforms are subject to 

increased scrutiny from a social responsibility perspective.

The Company has long been endeavoring to promote the healthy development of the Internet industry, and efforts are 

being made to make the products and platforms of the Company exert a positive community influence. The Company 

pays close attention to content quality, product design and operation of the platform. The Company actively provides 

more  assurance  to  the  society  by  using  advanced  technology  to  prohibit  any  illegal  and  unhealthy  information  and 

content access the Company’s platform and products. For examples, the “Tencent Game Guardian Platform” is an time 

management tool used to control the time juveniles spend on games; “Shepherd Plan” is a non-profit platform used for 

preventing the telecom fraud and internet frauds; and “QQ City Power” is another platform used to find missing children 

in China. At the same time, the Company has established a sound monitoring and reporting mechanism to deal with 

illegal and vicious information.

88

Tencent Holdings LimitedCorporate Governance Report8.  Crisis management and reputation risk

As one of the China’s largest technology companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses, products and investments, the 

Company always attracts very high attention from the public and media. The media is diverse and information spreads 

rapidly. If the Company does not pay sufficient attention to public opinion, public relations to the crisis are not dealt 

with in a timely manner, and failure to disclose comprehensive and proper information to the public, it will damage the 

Company’s reputation, brand and image, and adversely affect the business and prospects the Company.

The  Company  has  set  up  professional  public  relations  department  and  teams  for  crisis  management,  with  public 

relations  management  mechanism  established.  The  teams  have  maintained  close  interaction  with  management  and 

business groups. The teams gather public opinions, analyse and identify relevant information and reports their analysis 

to  management  to  more  promptly  and  appropriately  respond  to  the  public  according  to  the  Company’s  policies  and 

procedures.

Internal Control

The  Company  has  always  valued  the  importance  of  the  internal  control  systems,  and  has  been  implementing  the  COSO 

Framework.

Management of the Company is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the effectiveness of internal 

control  systems.  The  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  performance  of 

management over the internal control systems to ensure it is appropriate and effective.

The Company’s internal control systems clearly define roles and responsibilities of each party as well as authorisations and 

approvals required for key actions of the Company. Policies and procedures are put in place for the key business processes. 

This information is also clearly conveyed to employees in practice and plays an important role in internal control systems. All 

employees must strictly follow the policies which cover, amongst other things, financial, legal and operational issues that set 

the control standards for the management of each business process.

In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  accountability  of  the  management  team  in  the  internal  control  systems  of  the  Company 

and  to  assist  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  such  internal  control  systems,  the  management  team  of  each  business 

group conducts self-assessment and confirms the internal control status of the business group for which it is responsible. 

The  IC  assists  the  management  in  preparing  a  self-assessment  questionnaire  according  to  the  COSO  Framework,  and 

guides the management of each business group to carry out the self-assessment. The IC is also responsible for collecting 

and summarising the results of self-assessment. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company reviews this summarised self- 

assessment of each business group, assesses the general effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Company, and 

submits the written confirmation thereof on behalf of the senior management team of the Company to the Audit Committee and 

the Board.

In addition, the IC supervises the establishment of the risk management and internal control systems set up by management, 

ensure that management has implemented appropriate measures and report the general situation of risk management and 

internal control of the Company to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The IA, serving as the independent third line of 

defence, conducts objective evaluation on the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 

and reports the results to the Audit Committee.

89

Annual Report 2017Corporate Governance ReportEffectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control

The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, continuously reviews the risk management and internal control systems.

The review process comprises, among other things, of meetings with management of business groups, IA, IC, legal, and the 

external auditor, reviewing the relevant work reports and information of key performance indicators, the management self- 

assessment on internal control as detailed above and discussing the major risks with the senior management of the Company.

The  Board  is  of  the  view  that  throughout  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  the  risk  management  and  internal  control 

systems of the Company are effective and adequate.

In  addition,  the  Board  believes  that  the  Company’s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  functions  have  been  performed  by 

staff  of  the  appropriate  qualifications  and  experience  and  that  such  staff  receives  appropriate  and  sufficient  training  and 

development. Based on the audit report of the Audit Committee, the Board also believes that sufficient resources have been 

obtained for the Company’s internal audit function and that its staff qualifications and experience, training programmes and 

budgets are sufficient.

community.  Therefore,  the  Company  works  to  maintain  effective  and  on-going  communication  with  shareholders  so  that 

they, along with prospective investors, can exercise their rights in an informed manner based on a good understanding of the 

Group’s operations, businesses and financial information. The Company also encourages shareholders’ active participation 

in  annual  general  meetings  and  other  general  meetings  or  other  proper  means.  As  such,  the  Company  sends  notices  to 

shareholders for annual general meetings at least 20 clear business days before the meeting and at least 10 clear business

94

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance Report“Internet+” has significant implications for our ESG initiatives. Important changes can be achieved through connecting millions 

of Internet users as well as developing their modes of communication and living, and creating more exciting opportunities 

for  society.  In  addition,  through  the  “smart  living”  system  in  QQ  and  Weixin/WeChat,  people  and  public  services  can  be 

digitally connected, which in effect facilitate developments in transport, healthcare, environmental protection, public safety 

and other social arenas. This is important for optimising the distribution of societal resources, driving innovation in  public 

services, improving service quality, breaking down communication barriers and ultimately benefiting the wider community. 

We will leverage our core capability in the Internet, technology and communication spheres to develop innovative approaches 

to resolving social issues, promoting social development and protecting the interests of the public. We also aim to drive ESG 

awareness in society, through collaborating with our stakeholders and other industry players.

Going  forward,  we  will  continue  to  enhance  our  corporate  management  system  and  integrate  ESG  considerations  into  our 

operations. We will closely cooperate with our stakeholders with the aim of creating a better future.

ENVIRONMENT

We recognise the importance of environmental protection and conservation of natural resources in our business operations. 

Starting from our office buildings in Shenzhen, we have implemented a number of energy-saving measures and we plan to 

adopt  the  same  in  our  office  spaces  in  other  locations.  We  have  also  strived  to  build  our  data  centres  with  environmental 

considerations as one of our key priorities.

Energy Saving Measures taken in our New Office Building

We  have  taken  environmental  protection  as  one  of  our  priorities  when  designing  our  new  office  building,  Tencent  Binhai 

Building,  in  Shenzhen.  The  construction  has  been  completed  in  accordance  with  LEED-EB  standards.  The  property 

management company of the Shenzhen headquarters has obtained ISO 14001 (environmental management) certification, 

ISO  9001  (quality  management)  certification  and  GB/T  23331  (energy  management  system)  certification.  We  have  also 

implemented various measures to enhance efficiency of energy use and reduce water consumption and emissions.

We  have  optimised  the  air  conditioning  system  and  the  integrated  building  management  system  in  order  to  automate  the 

energy saving and monitoring process. The air conditioning system uses pumps controlled by frequency-conversion technology 

for the enhancement of energy efficiency. We have also reduced energy consumption of the air conditioning system by partially 

deploying natural ventilation in autumn and winter.

Our new office building has adopted a centralised system to collect, purify and recycle rainwater and condensed water from 

the air conditioning system for the purposes of flushing, watering plants and cleaning the parking lot. In addition, we have 

installed a direct drinking water system in replacement of bottled water. It reduces the use of plastic packaging materials and 

indirectly reduces the CO2 emissions generated from the delivery of bottled water.

95

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe monitor the levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitro dioxide 

inside and outside our office building with an online monitoring system and display the data on a real-time basis. To ensure 

the air quality in the building, we have installed induced ventilation system (which regulates the ventilation automatically in 

response to the level of carbon monoxide) in the underground parking garage and fresh air ventilation system (which regulates 

the  ventilation  automatically  in  response  to  the  level  of  carbon  dioxide)  in  the  office  area.  We  have  upgraded  the  kitchen 

ventilation units in the kitchens in our office building. The units comprise fire-resistant environmental friendly exhaust hoods to 

remove oil and purify air with photolysis purification function and the activated carbon filter and air ioniser to neutralise odors. 

The emission of cooking fumes is in compliance with the PRC national standards GB18483-2001.

Energy Saving Measures taken in our Data Centres

We endeavour to fulfil our responsibility to protect the environment by applying innovative technology to our data centres and 

be the exemplar of green data centres in the PRC industry.

T-block technology (comprising (i) photovoltaic + High Voltage Direct Current (“HVDC”) technology for electrical design; (ii) 

indirect evaporative cooling units; (iii) smart control system; and (iv) fully commercialised project delivery solution) has been 

used in the fourth generation of our data centres, including the new data centre in Guangming, Shenzhen. Our PRC data 

centres are in the leading position in terms of power usage effectiveness in the PRC industry. According to a press release 

published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC in April 2017, the power usage effectiveness of 

newly built big data centres in the PRC should be below 1.5 on average while that of our recently built Shenzhen data centre 

(which is located in a low-altitude climate zone) was below 1.25.

Our data centres are one of the first in the industry to use the combined cooling heating and power system and photovoltaic 

technology to generate clean energy. In addition, we are building an advanced data centre with a high level of privacy, defence 

and security in Gui’an in the PRC, which will serve as a highly reliable and environmentally friendly data centre for our Group 

and our eco-friendly business partners. In the Gui’an data centre, we will apply our self-developed T-block technology and 

leverage  on  the  local  climate  and  landscape  to  build  a  technologically  advanced  and  energy  efficient  data  centre  with  an 

innovative approach.

We have shared our experience and technology in building green data centres with other industry players so that HVDC, micro 

module and indirect evaporative cooling technologies have been widely adopted in the PRC data centre business. We have 

also helped to establish the industry standards for HVDC and micro module technologies in order to enhance energy saving 

efforts among the industry players.

Table of Environmental Key Performance Indicators

Below  are  the  environmental  key  performance  indicators  of  the  Group.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  such  data  covers  the 

Group’s operation in China only; the data in relation to our office buildings excludes the data of Tencent Binhai Building which 

has only commenced partial operation since the last quarter of 2017 and the data in relation to our data centres only covers 

the main data centres which were built in the past three years.

The Group’s GHG inventory includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. GHG emissions data is presented in carbon 

dioxide  equivalent  and  is  based  on  the  “2015  Baseline  Emission  Factors  for  Regional  Power  Grids  in  China”  issued  by  the 

National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  of  China,  and  the  “2006  IPCC  Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas 

Inventories” issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Diesel was consumed for backup generators.

Hazardous waste produced by the Group’s operation mainly includes waste toner cartridge and waste ink cartridge from printing 

equipment at office buildings, as well as waste lead-acid accumulators at data centres. Waste toner cartridge and waste ink 

cartridge are collected and disposed of by printing suppliers, whereas lead-acid accumulators are disposed of by qualified waste 

recycling vendors. In 2017, there was no waste lead-acid accumulators.

5 

Non-hazardous  waste  produced  by  the  Group’s  operation  mainly  includes  domestic  waste  and  waste  electronic  devices. 

Domestic waste, including office waste and kitchen waste, is disposed of by the property management company and kitchen 

waste recycling vendors, and its data is not yet available for statistics, so we made estimation with reference to “Handbook on 

Domestic Discharge Efficiencies for Towns in the First Nationwide Census on Contaminant Discharge” published by the State 

Council. Waste electronic devices are recycled by wasting recycling vendors.

WORKPLACE

Employee Development and Training

We have a well-established performance management system. A performance assessment for each employee is conducted by 

that employee’s supervisor every six months and employees are required to work with their supervisors to set a performance 

target after each assessment. Supervisors are encouraged to provide constructive feedback from time to time to assist the 

personal growth of each employee.

As  our  staff  is  one  of  our  most  important  assets,  we  invest  heavily  in  employee  development  and  training.  We  encourage 

employees to attend external and internal trainings. We have adopted relevant policies to ensure that employee trainings are 

provided and managed in a systematic manner. For example, supervisors are required to assist in designing the professional 

development plans for the employees and evaluate the effectiveness of the trainings received by the employees. To ensure the 

quality of the trainings, we have also developed policies which set out requirements for the qualifications and experience of the 

instructors and the objectives of the programmes and worked with external educational institutions from time to time to jointly 

develop training programmes.

In 2007, we founded our own corporate university, Tencent Academy. It offers different training programmes for each stage of 

an employee’s career, including an induction, on-the-job training and leadership training. It has also set up an online learning 

platform  and  a  mobile  learning  system  in  order  to  allow  employees  to  learn  anytime  and  anywhere.  In  2016,  we  won  the 

Innovation in Talent Development Award by the Association for Talent Development. We are the first Chinese enterprise which 

received such honour in that category.

As at 31 December 2017, there were approximately 600 face-to-face courses, 5,000 online courses and over 1,000 internal 

part-time instructors. Over the past decade, we ran face-to-face courses over 8,000 times per year and over 1,000 courses 

were livestreamed per year. The aggregate number of training hours of our employees in the past 10 years exceeds 5 million. 

Throughout 2017, the number of the average in-house training hours per employee was 39 and the percentage of employees 

who received training is 99%.

We also intend to open up our training resources to our business partners and industry players in order to enhance the market 

standard.

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportEqual Opportunities and Diversity

We had 44,796 employees as at 31 December 2017. Our employment practice is in compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations  (including  but  not  limited  to  those  which  prohibit  child  and  forced  labour)  and  does  not  discriminate  on  the 

grounds of gender, ethnicity, race, disability, age, religious belief, sexual orientation or family status. Diversity is well supported 

in our corporate culture.

The recruitment process strictly abides by the guidelines of the Group’s Human Resource Department. Every job applicant is 

required to provide information on his/her education background, qualification and job experience in a recruitment questionnaire, 

which is reviewed by Human Resource Department and verified by professional background check agency. This allows the Group to 

hire suitable candidate in accordance with the job requirements and, to the extent possible, avoid child and forced labour.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation

We  offer  competitive  pay  and  employee  benefits  to  attract  and  retain  talent.  The  remuneration  and  bonus  system  is 

performance-based and designed to reward employees with high performance and great potential.

Benefits

The basic benefits system was built and is maintained in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and market practice. In 

addition, certain special benefits are created to motivate employees and implement our strategy.

We were awarded by Universum as the most attractive employer in the Internet industry in 2015. We have also been voted as 

one of the best employers in the PRC for 12 consecutive years since 2006 in a survey jointly conducted by zhaopin.com and 

the Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University.

We care for the well-being of our employees. For example, we celebrate special occasions of our employees (e.g. anniversary 

of joining us, wedding and festivities) by giving them different employee benefits. We strive to create work-life balance and a 

safe and comfortable work environment for employees. Employees have the flexibility to choose the most suitable insurance 

plans for themselves and their families.

Promotion

Employees may apply for promotion during their interim and year-end performance reviews, provided that they satisfy  the 

requirements with regards to the length of service and performance. Depending on the practice area, the promotion will be 

reviewed and considered by different internal committees. The promotion review process is fair and open – there is a formal 

channel for our employees to provide and receive feedback. The promotion review is conducted in compliance with applicable 

laws and regulations.

100

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportEmployee Departure

All of our employees enter into written employment contracts which detail, among other things, the grounds for termination of 

the employment.

We value our relationship with our employees and handle employee departure (whether by resignation or dismissal) strictly 

in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We arrange an exit interview with each of the departing employees to 

understand the reasons for his/her departure and welcome any suggestions for improvement.

Work-Life Balance

We have implemented various initiatives such as flexi-time arrangements and volunteer service leave to help employees strike 

a good work-life balance. The leave scheme allows employees to enjoy annual leave, fully-paid sick leave, half-paid leave of 

absence and fully-paid special Chinese New Year leave which are above the statutory standard. Also, female employees are 

entitled to take fully-paid maternity leave, while male employees are also entitled to take fully-paid paternity leave. Employees 

can also apply for one day of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

We  also  organise  a  wide  variety  of  recreational  and  leisure  activities  (e.g.  running,  photography,  music,  dance,  language 

classes) for employees.

Occupational Health and Safety

We strive to provide a safe and comfortable work environment for our employees. There are well-established security and fire 

service systems and food safety monitoring system.

We have a designated team in charge of the physical and mental health of employees. We arrange annual medical checkups 

for  employees  and  organise  health  seminars,  fitness  sessions,  on-site  medical  consultations  as  well  as  face-to-face  and 

telephone counselling from time to time.

Our contribution to social insurance in the PRC is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and we offer various 

supplemental  insurance  benefits  to  employees  and  their  families  (including  medical  insurance,  critical  illness  insurance, 

accident insurance and life insurance).

Communication

We  strive  to  create  a  casual  yet  sophisticated  communication  channel  with  customised  content  for  our  employees.  There 

are  annual  rallies  for  employees  and  management,  face-to-face  discussion  forums,  featured  magazines  and  social  media 

platforms. The corporate strategy and culture are communicated and reinforced through these products and communication 

channels.

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportCOMMUNITY

Community Investment

We  set  up  the  Tencent  Charity  Foundation  (the  “Tencent  Foundation”)  on  26  June  2007.  It  is  a  non-public  fundraising 

foundation incorporated in the PRC and a separate legal entity. We commit to donating certain portion of our profits to the 

Tencent  Foundation  every  year  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  charitable  works.  As  of  31  December  2017,  our  Group  and 

our employees donated over RMB2.72 billion and RMB67 million in total to the Tencent Foundation respectively since its 

establishment.  During  the  year  2017,  our  Group  and  our  employees  donated  RMB820  million  and  RMB5.4  million  to  the 

Tencent Foundation respectively.

The Tencent Foundation believes that everyone can participate in charity work anytime and anywhere through technology. 

In June 2007, the Tencent Foundation leveraged on our Internet technical capabilities and online platforms to build the first 

online public fundraising platform. It is designed, developed and operated by the Tencent Foundation while we provide server, 

broadband  and  other  technical  support  for  free.  The  platform  is  open  for  eligible  charitable  organisations  free  of  charge. 

It  allows  charitable  works  to  be  performed  more  conveniently,  smoothly  and  transparently.  This  is  a  good  example  of  the 

application of the concept of “Internet+”. As of 31 December 2017, there had been approximately 5,300 active charitable 

organisations and over 15,000 charity projects in different locations with different focuses.

The Tencent Foundation has also applied technology to various charitable initiatives such as WeCountry for rural development 

and Tencent Three-dimensional Disaster Relief Programme in response to recent natural disasters in China via the online 

platform. In 2017, the total number of donations made by the Internet users is approximately 63 million and the total amount 

of the funds raised is over RMB1.6 billion.

The  highlight  of  the  Tencent  Foundation’s  charity  efforts  is  the  annual  “99  Charity  Day”  campaign  where  it  matches  the 

donations made by the Internet users between 7 September and 9 September via its online platform. In 2017, the Tencent 

Foundation donated RMB300 million for the campaign, of which 37% is for poverty relief, disaster relief and medical care, 

31% is for education initiatives and the remaining 32% is for environmental protection initiatives and others.

In addition to promoting philanthropy through the online charity platform, the Tencent Foundation makes direct donation in the 

following areas: (i) disaster relief; (ii) rural development; (iii) education; (iv) ecological conservation and cultural preservation; (v) 

community development; and (vi) poverty relief.

Disaster relief

In response to the recent natural disasters in the PRC as well as globally, the Tencent Foundation has created a multifaceted 

disaster  relief  model  by  combining  our  various  products  including  online  platforms,  instant  messengers,  online  payment 

and Internet search to help the public follow the latest news, participate in rescue efforts and make donations. In addition, 

the Tencent Foundation has made donations to support the rescue missions and post-disaster reconstructions. In 2017, we 

donated an aggregate of approximately RMB5.9 million to the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, the One Foundation, Ai 

You Foundation and other charitable organisations in response to the earthquake in Xinjiang and the landslides in Sichuan and 

for the post-disaster child care programme following the earthquake in Ya’an city.

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportRural development

In  2015,  WeCountry,  our  open  platform  built  on  the  “Internet  +  Village”  model,  was  launched  to  offer  villagers  access 

digital  technology  which  will  benefit  their  communities.  As  of  31  December  2017,  16  provincial  administrative  areas  with 

approximately 5,800 villages (or communities) joined WeCountry platform. The number of verified villagers is over 2 million and 

they interacted with each other via the platform for over 160 million times as of 31 December 2017.

Education

The Tencent Foundation has set up scholarships to promote education in the PRC, Hong Kong and other countries throughout 

the  years.  There  are  also  specific  donations  for  different  education  initiatives.  In  2017,  the  Tencent  Foundation  donated 

approximately RMB50 million in education related projects. For example, we set up a scholarship with each of China Children 

and Teenagers’ Fund, Li Po Chun United World College of Hong Kong and the Taxation Institute of Hong Kong. We sponsored 

activities of the Institute of Accountants Exchange and supported an education programme run by the China Children and 

Teenagers’ Fund.

Ecological conservation and cultural preservation

The  Tencent  Foundation  is  keen  on  environmental  protection  and  cultural  preservation.  In  2017,  the  Tencent  Foundation 

donated  approximately  RMB28  million  to  the  China  Foundation  for  Cultural  Heritage  Conservation  and  other  ecological 

conservation organisations to continue to preserve and repair the Great Wall and for the ecological conservation project in 

China.

Community development

In  2017,  the  Tencent  Foundation  donated  RMB7.6  million  to  China  Association  of  Social  Workers  and  other  community 

organisations in support of the community organisations to promote philanthropy and innovation in charity work.

Poverty relief

In 2017, the Tencent Foundation donated approximately RMB140 million to support poverty relief initiatives through Ai You 

Foundation and other charitable organisations.

103

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportVolunteering

In  2006,  some  of  our  employees  founded  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  on  their  own  initiative  in  response  to  our 

corporate  vision  of  being  “the  most  respected  Internet  company”.  Since  then,  the  Tencent  Volunteers’  Association  has 

contributed more than 100,000 hours of voluntary services. We launch more than 200 volunteering activities with more than 

5,000 participants every year. In 2016, the Tencent Volunteers’ Association was awarded a spot in the list of Top 10 Best 

Volunteer Organisations in Guangdong Province.

There are sub-divisions under the Tencent Volunteers’ Association in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan  and 

Guangzhou formed by different business groups, each with a special focus on online charity, emergency support, poverty 

relief, scholarship, environmental protection, care for children with special needs, animal protection and green network. The 

Tencent Volunteers’ Association works closely with the Tencent Foundation in various projects.

The Tencent Volunteers’ Association combines its expertise in technology to help the community. For example, it has been 

broadcasting information on missing persons via Weixin/WeChat and QQ and with the latest facial recognition and blockchain 

technologies, the number of successful cases increased tenfold from approximately 40 in 2016 to approximately 400 in 2017.

In 2016, the Tencent Volunteers’ Association also established the China IT-Philanthropy Union which promotes the “Internet + 

Charity” model by holding summits and publishing white papers on the successful examples of how the information technology 

has changed the landscape of charity work.

In order to encourage employees to participate in volunteer service, employees, since April 2012, have been granted one day 

of fully-paid volunteer service leave per year.

Anti-Corruption

Tencent embraces the value of integrity, proactivity, collaboration and innovation. To promote integrity, we have developed 

robust systems and measures to prevent, detect and deter corruption or any other fraudulent activities and internal audit is 

conducted to ensure the Group’s compliance with ethical standards which we promote and strive to uphold.

Risk Management and Internal Control Policy

In 2016, we updated the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy (the “Policy”) with a system comprising three lines of 

defence. The first line is business and functional departments. The risk management and internal control department serves 

as the second line while the internal audit department and anti-fraud team act as the third line of defence. The Policy sets out 

the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in risk management and controls (including those in relation to frauds). 

It is emphasized in the Policy that the management of each business group is primarily responsible for the risk management 

and  internal  controls  of  its  department.  If  any  fraudulent  activity  is  detected,  the  management  of  the  relevant  department 

shall improve the control procedures promptly to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The management may be subject to 

disciplinary actions if a fraudulent act occurs as a result of management’s failure to implement any internal control measures. 

Each business group has its designated team to provide internal control and risk management support. We apply continuous 

auditing to key businesses in order to detect irregularities and identify risks in a timely and systematic manner and to improve 

the effectiveness of fraud risk management and control.

104

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportTencent Sunshine Code of Conduct

All employees of the entire Group are required to follow and to strictly comply with the Tencent Sunshine Code of Conduct (the 

“Sunshine Code”). It expressly prohibits all kinds of fraudulent activity, bribery, extortion and any other activities which are 

not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Sunshine Code will be reviewed annually against the changing 

needs of the Group and revised when appropriate, in order to ensure that it reflects the positions under applicable laws and 

regulations and captures all kinds of fraudulent activities. To ensure our employees comply with the requirements and ethical 

standards stipulated in the Sunshine Code, all employees are required to complete e-learning programmes and attend various 

face-to-face training programmes with a view to understanding and refreshing the rules and standards of the Sunshine Code 

on a regular basis. For positions with high bribery risk, those employees are required to attend face-to-face training course at 

least once a year.

Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy

We have adopted an Anti-fraud and Whistleblowing Policy (the “Whistleblowing Policy”), which clearly conveys the message 

of zero tolerance in relation to fraudulent activity to all the employees and suppliers/business partners. All employees  and 

suppliers/business  partners  are  encouraged  to  report  genuine  concerns  about  any  potential  fraudulent  activities.  The 

Whistleblowing  Policy  outlines  the  multiple  whistleblowing  channels  and  how  the  Group  should  deal  with  such  concerns, 

so that employees and suppliers/business partners can report their good faith concerns without fear of reprisal or potential 

retaliation.

Fraud detection and corruption prevention

When a report of suspected fraudulent activities is received, the anti-fraud investigation team, which consists of professionals 

with  profound  knowledge  in  fraud  risk  management  and  solid  fraud  investigation  experiences,  is  assigned  to  handle  the 

investigation independently. After an investigation has been completed, the employee found and proven to have committed 

such fraud shall be subject to immediate dismissal, and corrective actions shall be taken in response to the findings at the 

same time. If we find any supplier or business partner engaging in corruption or any other fraudulent activities, we will put 

any supplier or business partner on the blacklist and terminate the contracts with them immediately. In the event that any 

fraudulent activity violates any relevant laws or regulations, such cases shall be reported to government authorities. In order to 

convey a message regarding our determination to fight against fraud and to introduce our whistleblowing system externally, we 

send a letter to our suppliers and business partners (including the current ones and the ones who ceased to work with us in 

the past two years) and request them to complete a questionnaire annually.

105

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportAnti-Money Laundering

The Group strictly abides by all applicable laws and regulations on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and 

fulfills its social responsibilities and legal obligations on anti-money laundering.

In 2017, we established an Anti-Money Laundering Committee (the “AML Committee”) chaired by our executive director and 

President, Mr. Lau Chi Ping Martin, with heads of each relevant business group as committee members. The AML Committee 

supervises and monitors the implementation of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures  at  the 

group level and at the subsidiary level with a unified approach. The objective is to centralise the management of the anti-

money laundering efforts within the Group.

We  continued  to  improve  our  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-terrorist  financing  systems  in  various  aspects  such  as 

infrastructure, know-your-customer process, procedures for identification and reporting of suspicious transactions and training. 

We have robust systems and measures to detect, deter and protect our business from involvement in financial crimes such as 

money laundering and terrorist financing.

Our protective measures include, but are not limited to, the following:

Three lines of defence

The  Group  has  implemented  a  three-line  defence  mechanism.  Our  first  line  of  defence  is  the  product  team  and  the 

business  development  team,  which  are  responsible  for  enhancing  the  awareness  of  anti-money  laundering  requirements 

and implementing anti-money laundering measures. The risk management team and anti-money laundering team serve as 

the second line and they are responsible for organising and coordinating the anti-money laundering efforts within the Group 

including but not limited to conducting assessments on the anti-money laundering governance and compliance, supervising 

the  construction  of  the  anti-money  laundering  compliance  framework  and  organising  trainings  and  public  relations  events 

relating to anti-money laundering. The internal audit team acts as the third line of defence and its main responsibilities include 

conducting the annual anti-money laundering audit and independent assessment on anti-money laundering governance.

Anti-money laundering and internal control systems

We  have:  (i)  formulated  a  set  of  anti-money  laundering  policies  based  on  the  applicable  anti-money  laundering  laws  and 

regulations; (ii) implemented an anti-money laundering monitoring system; and (iii) set up a dedicated anti-money laundering 

team,  which  is  solely  responsible  for  compliance  management,  anti-money  laundering  name  screening  and  suspicious 

transaction monitoring.

106

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportOther control measures

We have further improved the anti-money laundering compliance and internal risk control mechanisms by: (i) recruiting more 

anti-money laundering professionals for suspicious transaction review and analysis in order to enhance the effectiveness and 

specialisation  level  of  anti-money  laundering;  (ii)  strengthening  the  requirements  for  the  know-your-customer  procedures; 

(iii) enhancing the overall monitoring system of suspicious transaction and manual analysis; (iv) cooperating with regulators 

and law enforcement bodies on anti-money laundering investigation; (v) actively participating in the strike on terrorism and 

corruption internationally, in order to prevent money laundering and upstream criminal activities; and (vi) carrying out various 

forms of training, education and public relation activities on anti-money laundering.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Our  supply  chain  management  programme  attaches  supreme  importance  to  managing  the  ethics  risk  associated  with  the 

relationship between our procurement employees and our business partners. It also focuses on teaching those employees who 

are involved in procurement to recognise and mitigate the inherent risks.

To  enhance  the  social  responsibility  awareness  of  our  employees,  we  have  formulated  a  code  of  conduct  which  those 

employees engaging in procurement activities must adhere to. To minimise the ethics risks, such employees are also required 

to declare any relationship they may have with our suppliers in writing.

In  the  course  of  supplier  engagement,  potential  suppliers  are  required  to  conduct  self-assessment  on  their  commitment, 

amongst other things, to environmental protection, social responsibility, and health and safety at work (the “Self-Assessment”).

Suppliers which are formally engaged by us are also required to agree to the terms of a declaration and undertaking in relation 

to anti-commercial bribery in doing business with our Group (the “Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration”).

During the year ended 31 December 2017, all suppliers which were formally engaged had completed the Self-Assessment and 

signed the Anti-commercial Bribery Declaration. We are not aware of any of our suppliers engaging in commercial bribery, or 

being materially and adversely affected by issues relating to environmental and social responsibility.

The procurement department looks for qualified suppliers in the market and conducts standard or simplified verification on the 

suppliers depending on the duration of the cooperation, the order volume and the nature of the request. We have maintained a 

database of qualified suppliers which are ready to take orders from us.

We have an internal policy which sets out the procedures for supplier onboarding. Before engaging a supplier, we will form 

a supplier assessment team to conduct the background check (including site visit) on the supplier. The team will consist of 

members from the procurement department, the requesting department, the technology department (if applicable) and the risk 

management department. The assessment results will be reported to the procurement department for a final determination.

We normally ask for price quotations from at least three vendors. Other factors including delivery time and technical capabilities 

of the vendors will be taken into consideration when selecting vendors. If there is only one vendor available for selection as it 

dominates the relevant market or it is the only vendor with access to the required goods/services, the exclusive procurement 

arrangement  with  such  vendor  will  require  special  approval  with  a  satisfactory  justification  provided  by  the  technology 

department or the requesting department.

107

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe evaluate the performance of our suppliers from time to time and take appropriate steps to address any issues with the 

quality of the suppliers as part of our supply chain management. For suppliers with unsatisfactory performance, subject to the 

applicable contractual arrangements, we may (i) discuss with them on the remedial steps to be taken by them; (ii) suspend the 

cooperation; (iii) reduce the order volume; (iv) impose penalties; or (v) suspend payment. The procurement department may 

disqualify a supplier for the following events: (i) we suffer from material economic losses as a result of the delayed delivery, 

quality issue or breach of contract by the supplier; (ii) the supplier has received the lowest rating in the rating scale for two 

consecutive quarters; and (iii) the supplier has in serious breach of business ethnics.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

We strive to provide the best user experience and pay high attention to the quality of our products and services. We conduct 

strict reviews of our product and service offerings and related sales, marketing and advertising strategies and materials  to 

ensure their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We also build in safeguards on user privacy, product safety and 

IP rights as described below.

User Privacy

To uphold our dedication to value creation for our users, amongst other user specific aims, one of our important missions is to 

protect the privacy of user data and other sensitive information. We comply with all the applicable laws on privacy protection, 

and incorporate applicable legal and regulatory requirements on privacy protection into our internal compliance policies taking 

into account the specific features of our products and services.

We have a dedicated privacy team within the Legal Department which is responsible for handling data protection matters. 

We have devised specific procedures to collect and process user data to ensure that we provide our products and services in 

accordance with applicable legal requirements. We evaluate specific products from the perspective of privacy protection on 

a regular basis and perform privacy risk assessments before the launch of new products to ensure that our products are not 

exposed to the risk of privacy infringement or leakage of user data.

We provide training to our employees to enhance their privacy protection awareness and build up the cultural awareness of the 

importance of privacy protection.

To ensure that our users understand how we protect their personal information and enhance the transparency of how  we 

collect and process the data, we publish our privacy protection policies on our product websites and in-app products. We also 

provide communication channels for our users to file complaints and raise enquiries whenever they are in doubt.

We actively participate in shaping the development of the industry framework on privacy protection. For example, we have 

been accredited with privacy certifications from TrustArc for WeChat, which is the leading global data privacy management

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportCustomer Service

The Tencent Customer Service Centre consists of more than 2,000 staff members and is responsible for handling complaints 

and responding to enquiries from customers for our businesses. We commit to providing solutions to our customers in a timely 

manner through different means including customer service hotline, online customer support, Weixin/WeChat and face-to-face 

meeting.

We have established the following management system to handle complaints from our customers effectively:

1. 

There is a designated team within the customer service department to handle complaints and deal with compensation 

requests. The team is responsible for conducting investigation based on the information provided by the complainant, 

explaining the relevant procedures to the complainant and notifying the complainant of the investigation results with the 

aim of providing him with a satisfactory solution.

2. 

For  better  user  experience,  we  have  established  a  set  of  complaint  handling  procedures  which  set  out  clearly  the 

responsibilities  within  the  customer  service  department  and  the  timeframe  within  which  a  complaint  needs  to  be 

resolved.

3.  We have strengthened our system infrastructure which allows classification of complaints by urgency and risk level so 

that the customer service staff can better prioritise the cases and deal with the complaints in a timely manner.

4.  We have a designated team of staff who is responsible for handling complaints from customers who visit our offices and 

for better risk control we have designed a set of protocols for different types of incidents.

Healthy Environment for our Users

One  of  our  important  businesses  is  our  online  gaming  business.  We  need  to  comply  with  the  laws,  regulations  and  policy 

requirements in relation to online gaming in the PRC.

The  authorities  in  the  PRC  which  regulate  online  gaming  mainly  include:  (i)  the  General  Administration  of  Press  and 

Publication; (ii) the Ministry of Culture and Tourism; (iii) the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (iv) the State 

Administration for Market Supervision.

The laws, regulations and policies relating to online gaming mainly include: (i) “The Regulation on Internet Information Service 

of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China”  promulgated  by  the  State  Council;  (ii)  “The  Provisions  on  the  Administration  of  Online 

Publishing Services” promulgated by the former State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the 

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (iii) “The Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Culture”, 

“The Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Games” and “The Notice on Regulating Online Game Operation and 

Strengthening Concurrent and Ex-Post Supervisions” promulgated by the former Ministry of Culture. The aims of such laws 

include the regulation of the qualifications of operating entities of online games, the regulation of the content of online games, 

the  protection  for  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  online  game  users  and  adolescents  and  the  privacy  protection  of  the 

personal data of users.

109

Annual Report 2017Environmental, Social and Governance ReportWe  have  been  actively  implementing  various  measures  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  relevant  laws,  regulations  and 

policies.  For  instance,  we  have  already  obtained  the  relevant  credentials  for  operating  online  games,  for  example,  the 

Telecommunication  Business  Operation  Permit,  the  Online  Publishing  Service  Licence  and  the  Internet  Culture  Business 

Permit.

To safeguard the physical and mental health of online game users and adolescents, we have implemented the real  name 

system and anti-addiction system in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the PRC and strengthened the promotion 

of  healthy  gaming  and  anti-addiction  through  various  channels.  In  February  2017,  we  have  launched  a  series  of  services 

on “Tencent Game Guardian Platform” (http://jiazhang.qq.com) which assists parents to monitor the gaming habits of their 

underage children. This is the platform dedicated to healthy gaming of underage children in the online game industry. In July 

2017, we have implemented an anti-addiction system on Honour of Kings, which sends reminders to players or forces logout 

from the game if players spend too much time on the game in one day. So far it is one of the strictest anti-addiction measures 

taken by a gaming company in the PRC mobile game industry.

In addition, we have worked with School of Brain and Cognitive Science of Beijing Normal University and Data Centre of the 

China  Internet  (DCCI)  to  publish  “Guide  on  Healthy  Use  of  the  Internet  for  Teenagers”  and  “Research  on  Online  Gaming 

Behaviours of and Online Protections for Teenagers”. Parents, education institutions and industry players can download these 

documents free of charge for their reference.

Monitoring of and Protection for Original User-generated Content

Each of Weixin/WeChat and QQ provides a mechanism for users to report any fake or in appropriate content circulated on its 

platform. To protect the original user-generated content, Weixin/WeChat has launched a new feature in December 2017 for the 

Weixin/WeChat official account holders to declare the originality of the content generated by them on Weixin/WeChat so as to 

help identify and deter copyright infringement more effectively.

Intellectual Property Rights

We are a technology-oriented company and we stress the importance of the observation and protection of intellectual property 

(“IP”) rights. We have established a dedicated IP team with approximately 80 employees as of 31 December 2017 that is 

responsible for the day-to-day management of legal matters involving trademark, patent, copyright, domain names and other 

IP rights.

110

Tencent Holdings LimitedEnvironmental, Social and Governance ReportWe began a comprehensive programme for the management of IP at an early stage. We have consistently applied for  the 

registration of IP rights since the early stages of its establishment. With the successful development of our business, we have 

expanded our global IP portfolio to cover more than 100 countries and regions. As of 31 December 2017, we had obtained 

over 14,000 officially registered trademarks and over 6,000 issued patents. Coupled with our creation of a vast amount of 

copyrighted  content,  we  have  accumulated  IP  assets  of  considerable  value.  Our  IP  team  has  developed  a  comprehensive 

database for our patents, trademarks and copyrights and our strong data analytical skills enable us to manage and monitor 

our IP rights in a meticulous and efficient manner. To combat infringement of IP rights, our IP team has also established a 

comprehensive and efficient monitoring and maintenance system, and has devised various civil, criminal and administrative 

enforcement measures to enforce our IP rights. Please see further details on the Company Website (https://www.tencent.com/

legal/html/en-us/property.html).

We  actively  participate  in  public  affairs  and  strive  to  promote  the  awareness  of  IP  protection  in  the  Internet  industry.  As 

members of the China National Information Technology Standardisation Committee, the China Intellectual Property Society, 

the Patent Protection Association of China, the World Wide Web Consortium, the International Trademark Association and 

the China Trademark Association, we have participated in the consultations on legislative amendments to the PRC laws and 

regulations  relating  to  patents,  trademarks  and  anti-competition  and  have  made  recommendations  in  the  development  of 

industry standards.

Within the past decade, we have several times been awarded “China Patent Gold Awards” by the State Intellectual Property 

Office of the PRC, “China Trademark Awards” jointly by World Intellectual Property Organisation and the State Administration 

for Industry & Commerce of the PRC and “China Copyright Gold Awards” by the National Copyright Administration of the PRC 

and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signifying our contribution to the development of independent innovation 

of the PRC. We have also several times been awarded “National Copyright Demonstration Unit”, recognising our outstanding 

performance in management and protection of copyright. In November 2017, we were awarded “China Appearance Design 

Gold Award” by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC and the World Intellectual Property Organisation and this is 

the first time where a graphic user interface won such title.

Looking forward, we will continue to devote great efforts and resources to observe and protect IP rights.

Annual Report 2017Independent Auditor’s Report OTHER INFORMATION

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information 

included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  THOSE  CHARGED  WITH  GOVERNANCE  FOR  THE  CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and 

fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such 

internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are 

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 

unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

118

Tencent Holdings LimitedIndependent Auditor’s ReportAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. We report 

our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to 

any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 

that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 

and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from 

fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  internal 

control.

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by the directors.

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 

on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 

to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 

date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 

concern.

119

Annual Report 2017Independent Auditor’s Report • 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 

disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

• 

Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 

significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit 

matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the 

matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Tencent Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The address of 

its registered office is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The 

shares of the Company have been listed on the main board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock 

Exchange”) since 16 June 2004.

The  Company  is  an  investment  holding  company.  The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  “Group”)  are 

principally  engaged  in  the  provision  of  value-added  services  (“VAS”)  and  online  advertising  services  to  users  in  the 

People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).

The operations of the Group were initially conducted through Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited 

(“Tencent Computer”), a limited liability company established in the PRC by certain shareholders of the Company on 11 

November 1998. Tencent Computer is legally owned by the core founders of the Company who are PRC citizens (the 

“Registered Shareholders”).

The PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunications services, 

which include activities and services operated by Tencent Computer. In order to enable certain foreign companies to 

make investments into the business of the Group, the Company established a subsidiary, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) 

Company Limited (“Tencent Technology”), which is a wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated in the PRC, on 24 

February 2000. The foreign investors of the Company then subscribed to additional equity interests in the Company.

Under  a  series  of  contractual  arrangements  (collectively,  “Structure  Contracts”)  entered  into  among  the  Company, 

Tencent Technology, Tencent Computer and the Registered Shareholders, the Company is able to effectively control, 

recognise and receive substantially all the economic benefit of the business and operations of Tencent Computer. In 

summary, the Structure Contracts provide the Company through Tencent Technology with, among other things:

the right to receive the cash received by Tencent Computer from its operations which is surplus to its requirements, 

having  regard  to  its  forecast  working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditure,  and  other  short-term  anticipated 

expenditure through various commercial arrangements;

the right to ensure that Tencent Technology owns the valuable assets of the business through the assignment to 

Tencent Technology of the principal present and future intellectual property rights of Tencent Computer; and

the right to control the management, financial and operating policies of Tencent Computer.

GENERAL INFORMATION (Cont’d)

As a result, Tencent Computer is accounted for as a controlled structured entity (see also Note 2.2(a) and Note 45) 

and the formation of the Group in 2000 was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common 

control under a method similar to the uniting of interests method for recording all assets and liabilities at predecessor 

carrying amounts. This approach was adopted because in management’s belief it best reflected the substance of the 

formation.

Similar Structure Contracts were also executed for other PRC operating companies established by the Group similar to 

Tencent Computer subsequent to 2000. All these PRC operating companies are treated as controlled structured entities 

of the Company and their financial statements have also been consolidated by the Company. See details in Note 45.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  all  applicable 

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 

under  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the  revaluation  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets  and 

derivative financial instruments, which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 

estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 

policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 

estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

Annual Report 2017Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20172 

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(a)  Amendments to standards adopted by the Group

The following amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial 

year beginning on 1 January 2017. The adoption of these amendments does not have any significant impact 

on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

IAS 7 (amendment)

Disclosure initiative

IAS 12 (amendment)

Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses

IFRS 12 (amendment)

Clarification of disclosure requirement of interests in entities classified as 

  held for sale

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are not effective for the financial year beginning 

1  January  2017,  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial 

statements. In respect of IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”, IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” 

and IFRS 16 “Lease”, none of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 

statements of the Group except IFRS 9, details of which are set out below.

(i) 

IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”

IFRS  9  “Financial  instruments”  addresses  the  classification,  measurement  and  derecognition  of 

financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  introduces  new  rules  for  hedge  accounting  and  a  new 

impairment model for financial assets.

The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is expecting the following impact from 

the adoption of the new standard on 1 January 2018:

•  

Classification and measurement of financial instruments

The  Group’s  investments  in  redeemable  instruments  of  associates,  certain  available-for-sale 

financial assets and certain other financial assets of the Group will be reclassified to financial 

assets at fair value through profit or loss and cumulative fair values change of these available-

for-sale  financial  assets  as  at  31  December  2017  currently  recognised  in  other  reserves  will

financial assets of the Group will be reclassified to financial assets at fair value through other 

comprehensive income and not recycling to income statement.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective (Cont’d)

(i) 

IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” (Cont’d)

•  

Classification and measurement of financial instruments (Cont’d)

There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements  

only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or 

loss, while the Group does not have any such liabilities.

•  

Derivatives and hedging activities

The  new  hedge  accounting  rules  will  align  the  accounting  for  hedging  instruments  more 

closely with the Group’s established risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge 

relationships  might  be  eligible  for  hedge  accounting,  given  the  standard  introduces  a  more 

principle-based approach. The Group has confirmed that its current hedge relationships will be 

qualified as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.

•  

Impairment of financial assets

The  new  impairment  model  requires  the  recognition  of  impairment  provisions  based  on 

expected  credit  losses  rather  than  only  incurred  credit  losses  as  is  the  case  under  IAS  39.  It 

applies to financial assets classified at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fair value 

through other comprehensive income, contract assets under IFRS 15, lease receivables, loan 

commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts. Based on the assessments undertaken 

to  date,  the  Group  expects  changes  in  the  loss  allowance  for  account  receivables  to  be 

insignificant.

The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. 

These  are  expected  to  change  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  Group’s  disclosures  about  its  financial 

instruments.

IFRS 9 must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is 

permitted. The Group will apply the new rules retrospectively from 1 January 2018, with the practical 

expedients permitted under the standard. Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated.

2.1  Basis of preparation (Cont’d)

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective (Cont’d)

(ii) 

IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”

IFRS  15  “Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers”  will  replace  IAS  18  “Revenue”  and  IAS  11 

“Construction contracts” and the related interpretation’s on revenue recognition.

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining when to recognize revenue and how 

much revenue to recognize through a five step approach: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 

(ii) identify separate performance obligations in a contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) 

allocate transaction price to performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when performance 

obligation  is  satisfied.  IFRS  15  also  provides  specific  guidance  on  contract  costs  and  license 

arrangements. It also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements about revenue and cash flows 

arising from the contracts with customers.

The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption.

Based on the management’s assessment on the adoption of IFRS 15, the Group expects the effects of 

applying the new standard on the Group’s financial statements to be insignificant.

IFRS  15  must  be  applied  for  financial  years  commencing  on  or  after  1  January  2018  and  earlier 

adoption is permitted. The Group will apply the full retrospective approach upon the adoption since 1 

January 2018.

(b)  New standards and amendments to standards that have been issued but not effective (Cont’d)

(iii) 

IFRS 16 “Lease”

IFRS 16 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the 

distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the 

right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions 

are short-term and low-value leases.

The  accounting  for  lessors  will  not  be  significantly  changed.  The  standard  will  affect  primarily  the 

accounting for Group’s operating leases. However, the Group has just commenced its assessment and 

have not yet determined to what extent its commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a 

liability for future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows.

The new standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The Group 

does not intend to adopt this standard before its effective date.

2.2  Subsidiaries

(a)  Consolidation

Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group 

controls  an  entity  when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement 

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 

date that control ceases.

Intra-group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  group  companies  are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 

of the transferred asset. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform 

with the Group’s accounting policies.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 

incurred  to  the  former  owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interests  issued  by  the  Group.  The 

consideration  transferred  includes  the  fair  value  of  any  asset  or  liability  resulting  from  a  contingent 

consideration  arrangement.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities 

assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  on  an  acquisition-by-acquisition 

basis. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their 

holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at 

either fair value or the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of 

the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured 

at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any 

gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  Group  is  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the 

acquisition  date.  Subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  that  is 

deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. Contingent 

consideration  that  is  classified  as  equity  is  not  re-measured,  and  its  subsequent  settlement  is 

accounted for within equity.

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(a)  Consolidation (Cont’d)

(i) 

Business combinations (Cont’d)

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 

and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 

of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, 

non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value 

of  the  net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  bargain  purchase,  the  difference  is 

recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

(ii)  Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions  with  non-controlling  interests  that  do  not  result  in  a  loss  of  control  are  accounted  for 

as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of 

the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals 

to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii)  Disposal of subsidiaries

When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  re-measured  to  its 

fair  value  at  the  date  when  control  is  lost,  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount  recognised  in  the 

consolidated  income  statement.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of 

subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, a joint venture or financial asset. In 

addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity 

are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. It means that 

amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated 

income  statement  or  transferred  to  another  category  of  equity  as  specified/permitted  by  applicable 

IFRSs.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.2  Subsidiaries (Cont’d)

(b)  Separate financial statements

Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  less  impairment.  Cost  includes  direct  attributable 

costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends 

received and receivable. In addition, the contribution to the Company’s Share Scheme Trust (as defined in 

Note 45(e)), a controlled structured entity, is stated at cost in “Contribution to Share Scheme Trust”, and will 

be transferred to the “Shares held for share award schemes” under equity when the contribution is used for 

the acquisition of the Company’s shares.

Impairment  testing  of  the  investments  in  subsidiaries  is  required  upon  receiving  dividends  from  these 

investments if the dividends exceed the total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries in the period the 

dividends  are  declared  or  if  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  the  separate  financial  statements 

exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s net assets including 

goodwill.

2.3  Associates

Associates  are  all  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  but  not  control,  generally  but  not 

necessarily accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates 

are  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting  and  are  initially  recognised  at  cost.  The  Group’s 

investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. Upon 

the acquisition of the ownership interest in an associate, any difference between the cost of the associate and the 

Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.3  Associates (Cont’d)

The  Group’s  share  of  its  associates’  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income 

statement,  and  its  share  of  post-acquisition  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  recognised  in  other 

comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of 

the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests in the associate, 

including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 

incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that investments accounted 

for using the equity method, including associates and joint arrangements (Note 2.4), are impaired. If this is the 

case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 

investment and its carrying value and recognises the amount in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated 

income statement.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 

interests  in  the  associates.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides  evidence  of 

an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business 

whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, 

even  if  those  assets  are  held  by  a  subsidiary.  Accounting  policies  of  associates  have  been  changed  where 

necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Gains or losses on dilution of equity interest in associates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

If  the  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  is  reduced  but  significant  influence  is  retained,  only  a  proportionate 

share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to consolidated income 

statement where appropriate.

The Group’s investments in associates in the form of redeemable instruments are accounted for as compound 

financial instruments (Note 2.27).

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.4  Joint arrangements

Under  IFRS  11  investments  in  joint  arrangements  are  classified  as  either  joint  operations  or  joint  ventures 

depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint 

arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 

thereafter  to  recognise  the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profit  or  loss  and  movements  in  other 

comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 

joint venture (which includes any long-term receivables that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment 

in  the  joint  venture),  the  Group  does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has  incurred  obligations  or  made 

payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the 

Group’s  interests  in  the  joint  ventures.  Unrealised  losses  are  also  eliminated  unless  the  transaction  provides 

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves 

a business whereas a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute 

a  business,  even  if  those  assets  are  held  by  a  subsidiary.  Accounting  policies  of  the  joint  ventures  have  been 

changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

2.5 

Investments in associates/joint ventures achieved in stages

The cost of associates/joint ventures acquired in stages, except for the change from an associate to a joint venture, 

is  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  fair  value  of  the  interests  previously  held  plus  the  fair  value  of  any  additional 

consideration transferred as of the date when it becomes associate/joint venture. A gain or loss on re-measurement 

of the previously held interests is taken to the consolidated incomes statement. Any other comprehensive income 

recognised in prior periods in relation to the previously held interests is also taken to the consolidated income 

statement. Any acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

2.6  Partial disposal of associates to available-for-sale financial assets

When the Group loses significant influence over an associate, it measures any retained investment at fair value. A 

profit or loss is recognised at any difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus any proceeds from 

disposing part of the interests in the associate and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity 

method of accounting was discontinued. The amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income by an 

associate should be reclassified to the consolidated income statement or transferred to another category of equity 

as specified and permitted by applicable IFRSs when the Group loses significant influence over the associate.

2.7  Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 

decision-makers,  who  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  and  assessing  performance  of  the  operating 

segments  and  making  strategic  decisions.  The  chief  operating  decision-makers  mainly  include  the  executive 

directors.

2.8  Foreign currency translation

(a)  Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional 

currency of the Company and certain of its overseas subsidiaries is United States Dollars (“USD”). As the 

major operations of the Group are within the PRC, the Group presents its consolidated financial statements 

in Renminbi (“RMB”), unless otherwise stated.

(b)  Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 

at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of 

such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Changes in the fair value of debt securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale 

financial assets are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost 

of the securities, and other changes in the carrying amount of the securities. Translation differences related 

to changes in the amortised cost and interest income are recognised in the consolidated income statement, 

and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at 

fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the fair value 

gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equity instruments classified 

as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.

2.8  Foreign currency translation (Cont’d)

(c)  Group companies

The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a  hyper-

inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of RMB are 

translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) 

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 

at the date of that statement of financial position;

(ii) 

Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 

this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 

transactions); and

(iii)  All  resulting  currency  translation  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate  component  of  other 

comprehensive income.

On  consolidation,  exchange  differences  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  net  investment  in  foreign 

operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 

liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are 

recognised in other comprehensive income.

2.9  Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment charges. Historical costs includes expenditure that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 

only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 

of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 

and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are 

incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 

Computer equipment 

Furniture and office equipment 

Motor vehicles 

20 - 50 years

2 - 5 years

2 - 5 years

5 years

Leasehold improvements 

Shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 

period.

Construction in progress represents buildings under construction, which is stated at actual construction cost less 

any impairment loss. Construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment when completed and 

ready for use.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 

greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.14).

Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying  amount  and  are 

recognised in “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement.

2.10 Investment properties

Investment  properties  are  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  are  not  occupied  by  the  Group.  Investment 

properties  are  carried  at  historical  costs  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated  impairment  charges. 

Historical costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to allocate their costs net of their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives of 20-50 years. Investment properties’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 

adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Investment properties’ carrying amounts are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts if their carrying 

amounts are greater than their estimated recoverable amounts.

2.11 Land use rights

Land use rights are up-front payments to acquire long-term interest in land. These payments are stated at cost and 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the lease.

2.12 Intangible assets

(a)  Goodwill

Goodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  represents  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred 

over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 

acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of 

the cash-generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within 

the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 

operating segment level.

Goodwill  impairment  reviews  are  undertaken  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in 

circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable 

amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised 

immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

(b) 

Licensed online contents

The licensed online contents mainly include video and music contents. They are initially recognised  and 

measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  as  acquired  through  business  combinations.  Licensed  online 

contents are amortised using a straight-line method or an accelerated method which reflects the estimated 

consumption patterns.

(c)  Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets mainly include game licences, copyrights, computer software and technology and 

non-compete  agreements.  They  are  initially  recognised  and  measured  at  cost  or  estimated  fair  value  of 

intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years) using the 

straight-line method which reflects the pattern in which the intangible asset’s future economic benefits are 

expected to be consumed.

2.13 Shares held for share award schemes

The consideration paid by the Share Scheme Trust (see Note 45(e)) for purchasing the Company’s shares from 

the  market,  including  any  directly  attributable  incremental  cost,  is  presented  as  “Shares  held  for  share  award 

schemes” and the amount is deducted from total equity.

When the Share Scheme Trust transfers the Company’s shares to the awardees upon vesting, the related costs 

of  the  awarded  shares  vested  are  credited  to  “Shares  held  for  share  award  schemes”,  with  a  corresponding 

adjustment made to “Share premium”.

2.14 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life or are not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation and are 

tested annually for impairment. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 

which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 

asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at 

the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets 

other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting 

date.

2.15 Financial assets

(a)  Classification

The  Group  classifies  its  financial  assets  in  the  following  categories:  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through 

profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends  on 

the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, management’s intentions and whether the assets 

are quoted in an active market. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 

recognition.

(i) 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial 

asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 

Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 

category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are 

classified as non-current.

(ii) 

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 

greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. 

The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Accounts receivable”, “Deposits and other receivables”, 

“Term deposits”, “Restricted cash” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated statement of 

financial position.

(iii)  Available-for-sale financial assets

Investments are designated as available-for-sale financial assets if they do not have fixed maturities 

and fixed or determinable payments, and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-

term. Financial assets that are not classified into any of the other categories are also included in the 

available-for-sale  category.  They  are  included  in  non-current  assets  unless  management  intends  to 

dispose of the investment within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

(b)  Recognition and measurement

Regular way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date - the date on which the Group 

commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  asset.  Investments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  plus  transaction 

costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair 

value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the 

consolidated income statement. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through 

profit  or  loss  are  subsequently  carried  at  fair  value.  Loans  and  receivables  are  subsequently  carried  at 

amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or 

have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. When 

available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised 

in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement as “Other gains/(losses), 

net”.

Interest  on  loans  and  receivables  and  available-for-sale  financial  assets  calculated  using  the  effective 

interest method is recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of interest income. Dividends 

on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Group’s 

right to receive payments is established.

2.16 Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 

position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 

on a net basis, or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The legally enforceable right  must 

not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of 

default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.17 Impairment of financial assets

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset 

or a group of financial assets is impaired.

A  financial  asset  or  a  group  of  financial  assets  is  impaired  and  impairment  losses  are  incurred  only  if  there  is 

objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of 

the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 

financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

(a)  Assets carried at amortised cost

Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtor  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing 

significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that 

they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a 

measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 

that correlate with defaults.

For  loans  and  receivables  category,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  measured  as  the  difference 

between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 

credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the 

consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 

impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, 

the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market 

price.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related 

objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognised  (such  as  an  improvement  in  the 

debtor’s  credit  rating),  the  reversal  of  the  previously  recognised  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the 

consolidated income statement.

2.17 Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d)

(b)  Assets classified as available-for-sale financial assets

For equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 

also considered as an indication that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence of impairment exists, the 

cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less 

any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement - is 

removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in 

the consolidated income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income 

statement.

For debt securities, if any such evidence exists, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between 

the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and the current fair value, less any 

impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  -  is 

reclassified from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the 

fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively 

related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement, 

the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.

2.18 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 

subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 

whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The 

Group designates certain derivatives as either (i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a 

firm commitment (fair value hedges); (ii) hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of a recognised 

asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedges); or (iii) hedges of a net investment in a 

foreign operation (net investment hedges).

The  Group  documents  at  the  inception  of  the  transaction  the  relationship  between  hedging  instruments  and 

hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 

The  Group  also  documents  its  assessment,  both  at  hedge  inception  and  on  an  ongoing  basis,  of  whether  the 

derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 

flows of hedged items.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont’d)

2.18 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (Cont’d)

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges are recorded in the 

consolidated income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 

attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 

and qualified as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 

ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement within “Other gains/(losses), 

net”. When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and 

losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the cost of the asset.

Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 

immediately in the consolidated income statement in “Other gains/(losses), net”.

2.19 Inventories

Inventories, mainly consisting of merchandise for sale, are primarily accounted for using the weighted average 

method and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

2.20 Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are amounts due from customers or agents for services performed or merchandise sold in the 

ordinary course of business. If collection of accounts receivable is expected in one year or less, they are classified 

as current assets. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current assets.

Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 

effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

2.21 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, money market funds and other 

short-term highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

The  Group  does  not  recognise  cash  amounts  deposited  with  banks  (which  are  received  under  its  payment 

business) under users’ entrustment in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group holds these 

cash amounts as a custodian according to the relevant users’ agreements.

2.22 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or share 

options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where  any  Group  company  purchases  the  Company’s  equity  instruments,  the  consideration  paid,  including 

any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 

as  treasury  shares  until  the  shares  are  cancelled  or  reissued.  Where  such  shares  are  subsequently  reissued, 

any  consideration  received  (net  of  any  directly  attributable  incremental  transaction  costs)  is  included  in  equity 

attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

2.23 Accounts payable

Accounts payable are obligations to pay for services or goods that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 

business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 

less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the 

effective interest method.

2.24 Put option liabilities

Put option is the financial instrument granted by the Group that the counterparty may have the right to request the 

Group to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or other financial assets when certain conditions are met. If 

the Group does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset under the put 

option, it has to recognise a financial liability at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows under the 

put option. The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, if the Group revises its estimates 

of  payments,  the  Group  will  adjust  the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability  to  reflect  actual  and  revised 

estimated cash outflows. The Group will recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of revised 

estimated future cash outflows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate and the adjustments will 

be recognised as “Other gains/(losses), net” in the consolidated income statement. If the put option expires without 

delivery, the carrying amount of the liability is reclassified as equity.

The put option liabilities are current liabilities unless the put option can only be exercised 12 months after the end 

of the reporting period.

2.25 Financial guarantee contracts

The financial guarantee contract of the Group is a contract that represents guarantee provided by the Group in 

respect of a put arrangement granted by an investee to the employees of its subsidiary.

The financial guarantee is initially recognised in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantee was 

given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company’s liabilities under such guarantee are measured at the higher 

of the initial carrying amount less amortisation of fees recognised in accordance with IAS 18, and the best estimate 

of the amount required to settle the guarantee.

2.26 Borrowings and notes payable

Borrowings and notes payable issued by the Group are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 

incurred. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction 

costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over their terms using the 

effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan facilities to the 

extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the 

draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 

down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the term of the facility to 

which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 

liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Notes payable are classified as non-current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional obligation to settle the 

liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

General and specific finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 

added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 

sale. During the year ended 31 December 2017, finance cost capitalised was insignificant to the Group.

2.27 Compound financial instruments

Compound financial instruments held by the Group comprise instruments with redemption features of associates 

that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder.

The Group either (i) accounts for different components of the compound financial instruments separately or (ii) 

designates the entire financial instruments as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host 

component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as 

a whole and the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The subsequent measurement of the host component and 

embedded derivatives follow the respective accounting policy of financial instruments as stated in Notes 2.15 and 

2.18.

2.28 Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income 

statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 

equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity, respectively.

The  current  income  tax  charge  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  tax  laws  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at 

the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 

income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which 

applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 

amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 

bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  However,  the  deferred 

income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction neither accounting 

nor taxable profit or loss is affected. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related 

deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

2.28 Current and deferred income tax (Cont’d)

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 

available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, 

except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 

the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally the 

Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only when there is an agreement 

in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference in the foreseeable future, 

deferred tax liability in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from the associate’s undistributed profit is 

not recognised.

Deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in 

subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will 

reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be 

utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 

levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority  on  either  the  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable  entities  where  there  is  an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

2.29 Employee benefits

(a)  Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 

for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of 

the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of 

leave.

(b)  Pension obligations

The  Group  participates  in  various  defined  contribution  retirement  benefit  plans  which  are  available  to 

all  relevant  employees.  These  plans  are  generally  funded  through  payments  to  schemes  established  by 

governments or trustee-administered funds. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 

Group pays contributions on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis into a separate fund. The Group 

has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets 

to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods. The Group’s 

contributions to the defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred and not reduced by contributions 

forfeited by those employees who leave the plan prior to vesting fully in the contributions.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits

The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans (including share option schemes and 

share  award  schemes),  under  which  the  Group  receives  services  from  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants  as  consideration  for  equity  instruments  (including  share  options  and  awarded  shares)  of 

the Group. The fair value of the employee services and other qualifying participants’ services received in 

exchange  for  the  grant  of  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  is  recognised  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting 

period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied, and credited 

to share premium under equity.

2.29 Employee benefits (Cont’d)

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

For grant of share options, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of 

the  options  granted  by  using  option-pricing  model,  “Enhanced  FAS  123”  binomial  model  (the  “Binomial 

Model”), which includes the impact of market performance conditions (such as the Company’s share price) 

but excludes the impact of service condition and non-market performance conditions. For grant of award 

shares, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the market price of the Company’s 

shares at the grant date. The Group also adopts valuation techniques to assess the fair value of other equity 

instruments of the Group granted under the share-based compensation plans as appropriate.

Non-market performance and services conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 

that are expected to become vested.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Company,  the  Company  grants  its  equity  instruments  to  employees  of  its 

subsidiaries  to  exchange  for  their  services  related  to  the  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  share-based 

compensation  expenses,  which  are  recognised  in  the  financial  statement,  are  treated  as  part  of  the 

“Investments in subsidiaries” in the Company’s statement of financial position.

At each reporting period end, the Group revise their estimates of the number of options and awarded shares 

that are expected to ultimately vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 

consolidated income statement of the Group, with a corresponding adjustment made to equity.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 

credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

(c)  Share-based compensation benefits (Cont’d)

If the Group repurchases vested equity instruments, the payment made to the employee and other qualifying 

participants  shall  be  accounted  for  as  a  deduction  from  equity,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  payment 

exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such 

excess shall be recognised as an expense.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, at a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms 

had not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the  total 

fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee and other 

qualifying participants, as measured at the date of modification.

2.30 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; 

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably 

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for further operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 

determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an 

outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 

using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

2.31 Revenue recognition

The Group principally derives revenues from provision of VAS, online advertising services and other online related 

services in the PRC.

(a)  VAS

Revenues  from  VAS  are  derived  principally  from  the  provision  of  online  games,  community  value-added 

services and applications across various online platforms.

The VAS can be paid directly by end users by way of online payment channels or utilising the prepaid cards 

and tokens (representing a specific amount of payment unit) issued by the Group. In addition, certain VAS 

are paid through various third parties platforms.

The Group sells the prepaid credits through various channels such as sales agents appointed by the Group, 

telecommunication operators, third party platform providers, broadband service providers and Internet cafes, 

etc. The end users can register the prepaid credits to their user accounts on the Group’s online platforms 

and then gain access to the Group’s paid online products or services. Receipts from the sales of prepaid 

credits are deferred and recorded as “Deferred revenue” in the consolidated statement of financial position 

(see Note 37).

Revenue is recognised from the provision of VAS when the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised 

from the virtual products/items on the Group’s online platforms over the estimated lifespans of the respective 

virtual  products/items.  The  estimated  lifespans  of  different  virtual  products/items  are  determined  by  the 

management based on either the expected user relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the 

relevant virtual products/items depending on the respective term of virtual products/items.

2.31 Revenue recognition (Cont’d)

(a)  VAS (Cont’d)

In respect of the Group’s VAS services directly delivered to the Group’s customers and paid through various 

third parties platforms, these third party platforms collect the relevant service fees (the “Online Service Fees”) 

on behalf of the Group and they are entitled to a pre-determined percentage of commission fees (as part 

of “Channel and distribution costs”). Such Channel and distribution costs are withheld and deducted from 

the gross Online Service Fees collected by these platforms from the users, with the net amounts remitted to 

the Group. The Group recognises the Online Service Fees as revenue on a gross basis, given it acts as the 

principal in these transactions, and recognises such Channel and distribution costs as cost of revenues.

The  Group  also  opens  its  online  platforms  to  third-party  game/application  developers  under  certain  co-

operation  agreements,  of  which  the  Group  pays  to  the  third-party  game/application  developers  a  pre-

determined percentage of the fees paid by and collected from the users of the Group’s online platforms for 

the  virtual  products/items  purchased.  The  Group  recognises  the  related  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis 

depending  on  whether  the  Group  is  acting  as  a  principal  or  an  agent  in  the  transaction.  The  Group  also 

defers  the  related  revenue,  either  on  a  gross  or  net  basis,  over  the  estimated  lifespans  of  the  respective 

virtual products/items, given there is an implicit obligation of the Group to maintain and allow access of the 

users to the games/applications operated by the developers through its online platforms.

Determining  whether  revenues  of  the  Group  should  be  reported  gross  or  net  is  based  on  a  continuing 

assessment of various factors. The primary factor is whether the Group acting as the principal in offering 

services to the customer or as an agent in the transaction. The Group has determined that it is acting as the 

principal in offering services wherever the Group (i) is the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) has latitude 

in  establishing  the  selling  price;  (iii)  has  discretion  in  supplier  selection;  and  (iv)  has  involvement  in  the 

determination of product or service specifications. The Group adopts different revenue recognition methods 

based on its specific responsibilities/obligations in different VAS offerings.

(b)  Online advertising

Online advertising revenues mainly comprise revenues derived from media advertisements and from social 

and others advertisements, depending on the placement of advertising properties and inventories.

The Group recognises (i) revenue from performance-based advertising when relevant specific performance 

measures (such as delivery of pay-for-click, pay-for-download etc.) are fulfilled; and (ii) revenue from display-

based  advertising  on  number  of  display/impression  basis  or  ratably  over  the  respective  contractual  term 

with the advertisers or their advertising agencies, depending on the contractual measures, when the related 

advertisements are displayed.

(c)  Other revenues

The Group’s other revenues are primarily derived from provision of payment related services for individual 

and corporate users, cloud services and others. The Group recognises revenue when the service is rendered 

and the underlying transaction is completed.

2.32 Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account of the principal outstanding and the 

effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.

2.33 Dividend income

Dividends  are  recognised  as  income  when  the  right  to  receive  payment  is  established.  This  applies  even  if 

they are paid out of pre-acquisition profit. However, the investment may need to be tested for impairment as a 

consequence.

2.34 Government grants/subsidies

Grants/Subsidies from government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 

grants/subsidies will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Under these circumstances, the grants/subsidies are recognised as income or matched with the associated costs 

and expenses which the grants/subsidies are intended to compensate.

2.35 Leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by lessors are classified 

as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 

charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.36 Dividends distribution

Dividends distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s and Company’s 

financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders or board of 

directors where appropriate.

2.37 Research and development expenses

Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.

Costs  incurred  on  development  projects  (relating  to  the  design  and  testing  of  new  or  improved  products)  are 

capitalised  as  intangible  assets  when  recognition  criteria  are  fulfilled  and  tests  for  impairment  are  performed 

annually. Other development expenditures that do not meet those criterias are recognised as expenses as incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as expenses are not recognised as assets in subsequent periods.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

3.1  Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price 

risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to 

minimise the potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. Risk management is carried out 

by the senior management of the Group.

(a)  Market risk

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk

The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 

currency  exposures,  primarily  with  respect  to  RMB,  Hong  Kong  Dollars  (“HKD”),  USD  and  Euro 

(“EUR”). Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and 

liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of the Group’s 

subsidiaries. The functional currency of the Company and majority of its overseas subsidiaries is USD 

whereas the functional currency of the subsidiaries which operate in the PRC is RMB.

The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign 

exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures through natural hedges, wherever possible, 

and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, when necessary.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(i) 

Foreign exchange risk (Cont’d)

At  31  December  2017,  management  considers  that  any  reasonable  changes  in  foreign  exchange 

rates  of  the  above  currencies  against  the  two  major  functional  currencies  would  not  result  in  a 

significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities 

denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  respective  Group’s  subsidiaries’  function  currency  are 

considered to be insignificant, given the exchange rate peg between HKD and USD. Accordingly, no 

sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk (2016: Nil).

(ii)  Price risk

The Group is exposed to price risk mainly arising from investments that are classified as available-

for-sale  financial  assets  held  by  the  Group  (Note  24).  To  manage  its  price  risk  arising  from  the 

investments,  the  Group  diversifies  its  investment  portfolio.  The  investments  are  made  either  for 

strategic purposes, or for the purpose of achieving investment yield and balancing the Group’s liquidity 

level simultaneously. Each investment is managed by senior management on a case by case basis.

Sensitivity analysis is performed by management to assess the exposure of the Group’s financial results 

to equity price risk of available-for-sale financial assets at the end of each reporting period. If equity 

prices of the respective instruments held by the Group had been 5% (2016: 5%) higher/lower as at 31 

December 2017, the other comprehensive income would have been approximately RMB4,069 million 

(2016: RMB3,879 million) higher/lower.

3.1  Financial risk factors (Cont’d)

(a)  Market risk (Cont’d)

(iii) 

Interest rate risk

The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent from changes in market 

interest rates and the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except for loans to investees and 

investees’ shareholders, term deposits with initial terms of over three months, restricted cash and cash 

and cash equivalents, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 25, 28 and 30.

The  Group’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  is  also  attributable  to  its  borrowings  and  notes 

payable, details of which have been disclosed in Notes 34 and 35, which representing a substantial 

portion of the Group’s debts. Borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates expose the Group 

to  cash  flow  interest-rate  risk  whereas  those  carried  at  fixed  rates  expose  the  Group  to  fair  value 

interest-rate risk.

The  Group  regularly  monitors  its  interest  rate  risk  to  identify  if  there  are  any  undue  exposures  to 

significant interest rate movements and manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate 

swaps, whenever considered necessary.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts 

to hedge its exposure arising from its borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate 

swap  contracts,  the  Group  agreed  with  the  counterparties  to  exchange,  at  specified  interval,  the 

difference  between  fixed  contract  rates  and  floating-rate  interest  amounts  calculated  by  reference 

to  the  agreed  notional  amounts.  These  interest  rate  swap  contracts  have  the  economic  effect  of 

converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified as hedging accounting. The 

Group’s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2017 have been detailed in Note 

26.

As  at  31  December  2017  and  2016,  management  considers  that  any  reasonable  changes  in  the 

interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to 

cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after 

considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is 

presented for interest rate risk.

(b)  Credit risk

The  Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  its  cash  and  deposits  placed  with  banks  and  financial 

institutions, other debt investments, as well as accounts and other receivables. The carrying amount of each 

class  of  these  financial  assets  represents  the  Group’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  the 

corresponding class of financial assets. To manage this risk, deposits are mainly placed with state-owned 

financial institutions in the PRC and reputable international financial institutions outside of the PRC. There 

has been no recent history of default in relation to these financial institutions.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that revenues of on credit terms are made to counterparties with 

an appropriate credit history and the management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its counterparties.

The Group’s online advertising that are sales to/through advertising agencies or directly to the advertisers at 

term of full advances, partial advances or sales on credit according to the Group’s credit policies. The credit 

period granted to the customers is usually not more than 90 days and the credit quality of these customers 

are assessed, which takes into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions 

are  made  for  past  due  balances  when  management  considers  the  loss  from  the  customers  is  likely.  The 

Group’s historical experience in collection of receivables falls within the recorded allowances.

The  Group’s  revenues  from  VAS  are  generally  paid  by  end  users  by  way  of  online  payment  channels  or 

utilising the prepaid cards and tokens issued and sold by the Group, whereas the revenue from VAS that 

delivered to its end users through third party platforms were collected by these third party platform providers 

and remitted to the Group under a credit period of 30 to 120 days. In addition, the Group also sold prepaid 

credits through various channels such as sales agents, telecommunication operators, third party platform 

providers  and  Internet  cafes,  etc.  Apart  from  certain  credit  periods  granted  to  the  telecommunication 

operators and third party platform providers, full advances were required from other channels.

In  view  of  the  history  of  co-operation  with  these  third  party  platform  providers  and  telecommunication 

operators,  and  the  sound  financial  position  and  collection  history  of  receivables  due  from  these 

counterparties,  management  believes  that  the  credit  risk  inherent  in  the  Group’s  outstanding  accounts 

receivable balances from these counterparties is low (see Note 29 for details).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.2  Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives on managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 

and support the sustainable growth of the Group in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 

stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to enhance shareholders’ value in the long term.

Capital  refers  to  equity  and  external  debts  (including  borrowings  and  notes  payable).  In  order  to  maintain  or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase the Company’s shares or raise/repay debts.

The  Group  monitors  capital  by  regularly  reviewing  debts  to  adjusted  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation 

and amortisation (“EBITDA”) (Note) ratio, being the measure of the Group’s ability to pay off all debts that reflects 

financial health and liquidity position. The total debts/adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the total debts 

by adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Borrowings (Note 34)

Notes payable (Note 35)

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating profit less interest income and other gains/ losses, net, and plus depreciation of property, 

plant and equipment and investment properties, amortisation of intangible assets and equity-settled share-based compensation 

expenses.

The movement in the ratio is mainly caused by higher adjusted EBITDA compared to prior financial year.

3.3  Fair value estimation

The table below analyses the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2017 by level of 

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a 

fair value hierarchy as follows:

•  

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

• 

Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and

• 

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 

(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined based on quoted market prices at 

the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 

from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent 

actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for 

financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 

techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 

as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a 

financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

•  

•  

•  

Dealer quotes for similar instruments;

The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

based on observable yield curves; and

Other  techniques,  such  as  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  are  used  to  determine  fair  value  for  financial 

instruments.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, there was no transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value 

measurements.  For  transfers  in  and  out  of  level  3  measurements  see  the  following  table,  which  presents  the

3.3  Fair value estimation (Cont’d)

Valuation processes of the Group (Level 3)

The Group has a team of personnel who performs valuation on these level 3 instruments for financial reporting 

purposes.  The  team  performs  valuation,  or  necessary  updates,  at  least  once  every  quarter,  which  coincides 

with the Group’s quarterly reporting dates. On an annual basis, the team adopts various valuation techniques to 

determine the fair value of the Group’s level 3 instruments. External valuation experts may also be involved and 

consulted when it is necessary.

The components of the level 3 instruments mainly include investments in private investment funds and unlisted 

companies, convertible bonds and other financial instruments. As these instruments are not traded in an active 

market, their fair values have been determined using various applicable valuation techniques, including discounted 

cash flows approach, comparable transactions approach, and other option pricing models, etc. Major assumptions 

used  in  the  valuation  include  historical  financial  results,  assumptions  about  future  growth  rates,  estimates  of 

weighted average cost of capital (WACC), recent market transactions, discount for lack of marketability and other 

exposure etc. Other financial liabilities include guarantee provided by the Group on certain put arrangements of 

an associate and put options issued by the Group to certain investors of the associate, at a pre-determined pricing 

formula. The fair value of these instruments determined by the Group requires significant judgement, including 

the likelihood of non-performing by the investee company, financial performance of the investee company, market 

value of comparable companies as well as discount rate, etc.

171

Annual Report 2017Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the year ended 31 December 20174 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The  Group  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  concerning  the  future.  The  resulting  accounting  estimates  will,  by 

definition,  seldom  equal  to  the  related  actual  results.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk 

of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year  are 

addressed below:

(a)  The estimates of the lifespans of virtual products/items provided on the Group’s online platforms

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.31(a),  the  end  users  purchase  certain  virtual  products/items  provided  on  the  Group’s 

online platforms and the relevant revenue is recognised based on the estimated lifespans of the virtual products/

items. The estimated lifespans of different virtual products/items are determined by the management based on 

either the expected users’ relationship periods or the stipulated period of validity of the relevant virtual products/

items depending on the respective terms of virtual products/items.

Significant  judgements  are  required  in  determining  the  expected  users’  relationship  periods,  including  but  not 

limited to historical users’ consumption patterns, churn out rate and reactivity on marketing activities, games life-

cycle, and the Group’s marketing strategy. The Group has adopted a policy of assessing the estimated lifespans 

of  virtual  products/items  on  a  regular  basis  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of  change  in  the  expected  users’ 

relationship periods.

The Group will continue to monitor the average lifespans of the virtual products/items. The results may differ from 

the historical period, and any change in the estimates may result in the revenue being recognised on a different 

basis from that in prior periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (Cont’d)

(b)  Recoverability of non-financial assets and investments in redeemable instruments of associates

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Goodwill and other non-financial assets, 

mainly  including  property,  plant  and  equipment,  construction  in  progress,  other  intangible  assets,  investment 

properties, land use rights, and investments in associates and joint ventures, as well as investments in redeemable 

instruments of associates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 

the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on value-in-

use calculations or fair value less costs to sell. These calculations require the use of judgements and estimates.

Judgement is required to identify any impairment indicators existing for any of the Group’s goodwill, other non-

financial assets and investments in redeemable instruments of associates, to determine appropriate impairment 

approaches, i.e., fair value less costs of disposal or value in use, for impairment review purposes, and to select 

key assumptions applied in the adopted valuation models, including discounted cash flows and market approach. 

Changing  the  assumptions  selected  by  management  in  assessing  impairment could  materially affect  the  result 

of the impairment test and in turn affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. If there is a 

significant  adverse  change  in  the  key  assumptions  applied,  it  may  be  necessary  to  take  additional  impairment 

charge to the consolidated income statement.

(c)  Fair value measurement of available-for-sale financial assets and other financial assets

The fair value assessment of available-for-sale financial assets and other financial assets that are measured at level 

3 fair value hierarchy requires significant estimates, which include estimating the future cash flows, determining 

appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could materially 

affect  the  respective  fair  value  of  these  investments.  The  Group  monitors  its  investments  for  impairment  by 

considering  factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  current  economic  and  market  conditions,  recent  fund  raising 

transactions undertaken by the investees, the operating performance of the investees including current earnings 

trends and other company-specific information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (Cont’d)

(d)  Share-based compensation arrangements

As  mentioned  in  Note  2.29(c),  the  Group  has  granted  share  options  to  its  employees  and  other  qualifying 

participants.  The  directors  have  adopted  the  Binomial  Model  to  determine  the  total  fair  value  of  the  options 

granted, which is to be expensed over the respective vesting periods. Significant judgement on parameters, such 

as risk free rate, dividend yield and expected volatility, is required to be made by the directors in applying the 

Binomial Model (Note 33).

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  to  employees  and  other  qualifying  participants  determined  using  the 

Binomial Model was approximately HKD2,691 million (equivalent to approximately RMB2,373 million) in  2017 

(2016: HKD668 million (equivalent to approximately RMB560 million)).

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2017, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 

88%-97% (2016: 88%-96%).

(e) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining 

the  worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes.  Where  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  from  the 

amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact current income tax and deferred income tax in 

the period in which such determination is made.

SEGMENT INFORMATION (Cont’d)

The  chief  operating  decision-makers  assess  the  performance  of  the  operating  segments  mainly  based  on  segment 

revenue and gross profit of each operating segment. The selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative 

expenses are common costs incurred for these operating segments as a whole and therefore, they are not included 

in the measure of the segments’ performance which is used by the chief operating decision-makers as a basis for the 

purpose  of  resource  allocation  and  assessment  of  segment  performance.  Interest  income,  other  gains/(losses),  net, 

finance income/(costs), net, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures and income tax expense are also not 

allocated to individual operating segment.

There were no material inter-segment sales during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. The revenues from 

external  customers  reported  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  are  measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  that 

applied in the consolidated income statement.

Other information, together with the segment information, provided to the chief operating decision-makers, is measured 

in a manner consistent with that applied in these consolidated financial statements. There were no segment assets and 

segment liabilities information provided to the chief operating decision-makers.

The  segment  information  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision-makers  for  the  reportable  segments  for  the  years

Income tax expense (Cont’d)

(iii)  PRC corporate income tax

PRC  corporate  income  tax  has  been  provided  for  at  applicable  tax  rates  under  the  relevant  regulations 

of  the  PRC  after  considering  the  available  preferential  tax  benefits  from  refunds  and  allowances,  and  on 

the estimated assessable profit of entities within the Group established in the PRC for the years ended 31 

December 2017 and 2016. The general PRC corporate income tax rate is 25% in 2017.

Certain subsidiaries of the Group in the PRC were approved as High and New Technology Enterprise, and 

accordingly,  they  were  subject  to  a  reduced  preferential  corporate  income  tax  rate  of  15%  for  the  years 

ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. Moreover, according to announcement and circular issued by relevant 

government authorities, for the year of 2015 and beyond, a software enterprise that qualifies as a national 

key software enterprise shall file its status with tax authorities for review and record in accordance with the 

relevant requirements at the time of final tax settlement each year in order to enjoy the preferential tax rate of 

10%. The PRC corporate income tax for the relevant subsidiaries of the Company filing for this preferential 

tax treatment has been provided for at their respective prevailing tax rates during the year. Upon receipt of 

notification, the relevant subsidiaries of the Company will be entitled to corporate income tax rate of 10% and 

corresponding tax adjustments will be accounted for.

In addition, according to relevant tax circulars issued by the PRC tax authorities, certain subsidiaries of the 

Company are entitled to other tax concessions and they are exempt from corporate income tax for two years, 

followed by a 50% reduction in the applicable tax rates for the next three years, commencing from the first 

year of profitable operation, after offsetting tax losses generated in prior years.

(iv)  Corporate income tax in other countries

Income tax on profit arising from other jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, East Asia and South 

America has been calculated on the estimated assessable profit for the year at the respective rates prevailing 

in the relevant jurisdictions, ranging from 12.5% to 36%.

(v)  Withholding tax

According to applicable tax regulations prevailing in the PRC, dividends distributed by a company established 

in the PRC to a foreign investor with respect to profit derived after 1 January 2008 are generally subject 

to  a  10%  withholding  tax.  If  a  foreign  investor  is  incorporated  in  Hong  Kong,  under  the  double  taxation 

arrangement between the Mainland China and Hong Kong, the relevant withholding tax rate applicable to the 

Group will be reduced from 10% to 5% subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.

Dividends  distributed  from  certain  jurisdictions  that  the  Group’s  entities  operate  in  are  also  subject  to 

withholding tax at respective applicable tax rates.

12  EARNINGS PER SHARE

(a)  Basic

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 

by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The share options and awarded shares granted by the Company have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. Diluted 

EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding by the assumption 

of the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from share options and awarded shares granted 

by the Company (collectively forming the denominator for computing the diluted EPS). No adjustment is made to 

earnings (numerator).

In addition, the share options and restricted shares granted by the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries and 

associates should also have potential dilutive effect on the EPS. During the years ended 31 December 2017 and 

2016, these share options and restricted shares had either anti-dilutive effect or insignificant dilutive effect to the 

Group.

Note:

Majority  of  the  Group’s  contributions  to  pension  plans  are  related  to  the  local  employees  in  the  PRC.  All  local  employees  of  the

welfare benefits. The plans are organised and administered by the governmental authorities. Except for the contributions made to these 

social security plans, the Group has no other material commitments owing to the employees. According to the relevant regulations, 

the portion of premium and welfare benefit contributions that should be borne by the companies within the Group as required by the 

above  social  security  plans  are  principally  determined  based  on  percentages  of  the  basic  salaries  of  employees,  subject  to  certain 

ceilings imposed. These contributions are paid to the respective labour and social welfare authorities and are expensed as incurred. 

The applicable percentages used to provide for these social security plans for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 are listed

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Cont’d)

During the year ended 31 December 2017, amortisation of RMB17,837 million (2016: RMB8,277 million) and RMB785 

million (2016: RMB653 million) were charged to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses, respectively.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of certain acquired business 

have been impaired to the extent of RMB239 million (2016: RMB366 million) (Note 7) as a result of significant decline 

in revenues and unsatisfactory operating performance of these business.

Impairment tests for goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs and most of the goodwill is related to the VAS. The recoverable amount of a 

CGU is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell. The key assumptions used for the calculations of the 

recoverable amounts of major CGUs are as follows:

For online game business, management calculates the fair value less costs to sell based on ratios of EV (enterprise value) 

divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of several comparable public companies 

(ranging within 16-23x) multiplied by the EBITDA of the related CGU and discounted for the lack of marketability at 

a range of 10% to 20%. The comparable public companies are chosen based on factors such as industry similarity, 

company size, profitability and financial risks.

For online literature business and online music business, management calculates value-in-use based on discounted 

cash flows calculations. The discounted cash flows calculations use cash flow projections developed based on financial 

budgets approved by management of the Group covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are 

extrapolated using an estimated annual growth of not more than 5%. Pre-tax discount rates of 20% to 25% adopted for 

the online music business and the online literature business, respectively, which reflects market assessments of time 

value and the specific risks relating to the industry that the Group operates. The financial projections were determined by 

the management based on past performance and its expectation for market development.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (Cont’d)

Note:

(i) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  the  Group  entered  into  a  share  purchase  agreement  with  an  associate  which  is 

engaged in eCommerce business, to subscribe for approximately 7% of its equity interests, on an outstanding basis, at a cash 

consideration equivalent to approximately RMB3,993 million.

(ii) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  the  Group  entered  into  a  share  purchase  agreement  with  an  associate  which 

operates an online ride-hailing platform in Asia other than China, to subscribe for approximately 10% of its equity interests, on an 

outstanding basis, at a cash consideration equivalent to approximately RMB2,646 million.

(iii)  During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group entered into share purchase agreements with an associate which is mainly 

engaged in online movie ticketing business to subscribe for 11.23% of its equity interests, on an outstanding basis, at a total 

consideration equivalent to approximately RMB1,897 million.

(iv) 

The Group also acquired certain other associates and made additional investments in existing associates, with an aggregate 

amount of RMB10,586 million during the year ended 31 December 2017. These associates are principally engaged in online 

game business and other Internet-related businesses.

(v) 

Transfers  mainly  comprised  re-designation  of  several  investments  from  available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  investments  in 

redeemable instruments of associates to investments in associates as a result of change in nature of these investments. Out of 

these  investments,  certain  contractual  rights  attached  to  an  investment  consortium  previously  classified  as  available-for-sale 

financial assets and other financial assets have been changed, thus resulting in re-designation of such investment to an associate 

of the Group. The management of the Group considered that the impact to the Group is not material had this investment been 

classified as an investment in an associate since 1 January 2017.

(vi)  During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group made an aggregate impairment provision of RMB1,277 million (2016: 

RMB2,117 million) against the carrying amounts of a number of associates. The impairment losses mainly resulted from revisions 

of long-term financial outlook and changes in business models of the affected associates.

(vii)  The associates of the Group have been accounted for by using equity method based on the financial information of the associates 

prepared under the accounting policies generally consistent with the Group.

shareholding exceeding 20%. Management determined that it has no significant influence on certain of these investees as the 

Group has neither board seats nor power to participate in decision making in these investees. Consequently, these investments 

have been classified as available-for-sale financial assets.

32  OTHER RESERVES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

The capital reserve mainly arises from transactions undertaken with non-controlling interests.

(b) 

In accordance with the Companies Laws of the PRC and the stipulated provisions of the articles of association of subsidiaries 

with  limited  liabilities  in  the  PRC,  appropriation  of  net  profit  (after  offsetting  accumulated  losses  from  prior  years)  should  be 

made  by  these  companies  to  their  respective  Statutory  Surplus  Reserve  Funds  and  the  Discretionary  Reserve  Funds  before 

distributions are made to the owners. The percentage of appropriation to Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund is 10%. The amount 

to be transferred to the Discretionary Reserve Fund is determined by the equity owners of these companies. When the balance 

of the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not to be made. Both the 

Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund and Discretionary Reserves Fund can be capitalised as capital of an enterprise, provided that the 

remaining Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund shall not be less than 25% of the registered capital.

In addition, in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Foreign Investments and the stipulated provisions of the 

articles of association of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the PRC, appropriation from net profit (after offsetting accumulated 

losses brought forward from prior years) should be made by these companies to their respective Reserve Fund. The percentage 

of net profit to be appropriated to the Reserve Fund is not less than 10% of the net profit. When the balance of the Reserve Fund 

reaches 50% of the registered capital, such transfer needs not be made.

With  approvals  obtained  from  respective  boards  of  directors  of  these  companies,  the  Reserve  Fund  can  be  used  to  offset 

accumulated deficit or to increase capital.

(c) 

Share-based compensation reserve arises from share option schemes and share award schemes adopted by the subsidiaries of 

the Group (Note 33(d)).

(d) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  the  Group  has  acquired  non-controlling  interests  in  certain  non-wholly  owned 

subsidiaries and the aggregate net excess of considerations over the carrying amounts of acquired non-controlling interests of 

RMB952 million (2016: RMB2,523 million) was recognised directly in equity. Out of which includes an agreement to entire non-

controlling interests (including the outstanding equity-settled and cash-settled share options and restricted shares under the 

relevant employees’ investment plans) in a non-wholly owned subsidiary entered into by the Group in 2015. The considerations 

were settled in cash and awarded shares of the Company. This acquisition was partially completed in 2017.

(e) 

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  a  non-wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Group,  China  Literature  Limited  (“China 

Literature”), have undergone initial public offering by listing of certain of its new shares and sale shares on the Stock Exchange 

and thus the Group’s equity interest in China Literature was diluted. Given China Literature remains a subsidiary of the Group 

following the said initial public offering, this transaction was accounted for as transaction with non-controlling interest with a gain 

of RMB2,495 million directly recognised in equity.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, another non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Group issued certain new shares in 

exchange for non-controlling interest of an investee, which accounted for as available-for-sale financial assets, and the Group’s 

equity interest in such non-wholly owned subsidiary was diluted accordingly. This transaction was accounted for as transaction 

with non-controlling interest with a gain of RMB4,088 million directly recognised in equity.

33  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(a)  Share option schemes

The Company has adopted five share option schemes, namely, the Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option 

Scheme I, the Post-IPO Option Scheme II, the Post-IPO Option Scheme III and the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV.

The Pre-IPO Option Scheme, the Post-IPO Option Scheme I and the Post-IPO Option Scheme II expired on 31 

December 2011, 23 March 2014 and 16 May 2017, respectively. Upon the expiry of these schemes, no further 

options would be granted under these schemes, but the options granted prior to such expiry continued to be valid 

and exercisable in accordance with provisions of the schemes.

In respect of the Post-IPO Option Scheme III which continues to be in force, the Board may, at its discretion, grant 

options to any qualifying participants to subscribe for shares in the Company, subject to the terms and conditions 

stipulated therein. The exercise price must be in compliance with the requirement under the Rules Governing 

the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange. In addition, the option vesting period is determined by the Board 

provided that it is not later than the last day of a 10-year period.

On  17  May  2017,  a  new  share  option  scheme  (“Post-IPO  Option  Scheme  IV”)  had  been  approved  by  the 

shareholders of the Company. The maximum number of shares in respect of which options may be granted under 

the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV shall not exceed 379,099,339 shares, representing 4% of the issued shares of 

the Company as at the date of shareholders’ approval of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV (the “Scheme Mandate 

Limit”). Options lapsed in accordance with the terms of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV shall not be counted for 

the purpose of calculating the 4% limit. The Company may refresh the Scheme Mandate Limit by an ordinary 

resolution of the shareholders passed in a general meeting, provided that the Scheme Mandate Limit so refreshed 

shall not exceed 4% of the issued shares as at the date the shareholders approve the refreshing of such Scheme 

Mandate Limit. Options previously granted under any existing schemes (including options outstanding, cancelled, 

or lapsed in accordance with the relevant scheme rules or exercised options) shall not be counted for the purpose 

of calculating the limit as refreshed. Options granted under the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV will expire no later than 

the last day of the 7-year period after the date of grant of options (subject to early termination as set out in the 

terms of the Post-IPO Option Scheme IV).

33  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (Cont’d)

(a)  Share option schemes (Cont’d)

(iii)  Fair value of options

The directors of the Company have used the Binomial Model to determine the fair value of the options as at 

the respective grant dates, which is to be expensed over the relevant vesting period. The weighted average 

fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 December 2017 was HKD71.30 per share (equivalent 

to approximately RMB62.86 per share) (2016: HKD56.41 per share (equivalent to approximately RMB47.33 

per share)).

Other than the exercise price mentioned above, significant judgement on parameters, such as risk free rate, 

dividend  yield  and  expected  volatility,  are  required  to  be  made  by  the  directors  in  applying  the  Binomial 

Model, which are summarised as below.

The expected volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is determined based on the 

average daily trading price volatility of the shares of the Company.

(b)  Share award schemes

The Company has adopted two share award schemes (the “Share Award Schemes”) as of 31 December 2017, 

which are administered by an independent trustee appointed by the Group. The vesting period of the awarded 

shares is determined by the Board.

Movements in the number of awarded shares for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

(b)  Share award schemes (Cont’d)

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  60,000  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent  non-

executive  directors  of  the  Company  (2016:  61,474  awarded  shares  were  granted  to  four  independent  non-

executive directors of the Company).

The fair value of the awarded shares was calculated based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the 

respective  grant  date.  The  expected  dividends  during  the  vesting  period  have  been  taken  into  account  when 

assessing the fair value of these awarded shares.

The  weighted  average  fair  value  of  awarded  shares  granted  during  the  year  ended  31  December  2017  was 

HKD274.02  per  share  (equivalent  to  approximately  RMB238.37  per  share)  (2016:  HKD165.25  per  share 

(equivalent to approximately RMB141.89 per share)).

The outstanding awarded shares as of 31 December 2017 were divided into two to five tranches on an equal basis as 

at their grant dates. The first tranche can be exercised immediately or after a specified period ranging from four months 

to four years from the grant date, and the remaining tranches will become exercisable in each subsequent year.

(c)  Employee investment schemes

For  aligning  the  interests  of  key  employees  with  the  Group,  the  Group  established  six  employees’  investment 

plans in the form of limited liability partnerships in 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (the “EIS”) respectively. 

According to the term of the EISs, the Board may, at its absolute discretion, invite any qualifying participants of the 

Group, excluding any director of the Company, to participate in the EISs by subscribing for the partnership interest 

at cash consideration. The participating employees are entitled to all the economic benefits generated by the EISs, 

if any, after a specified vesting period under the respective EISs, ranging from four to seven years. Wholly-owned 

subsidiaries of the Company acting as general partner of these EISs administer and in essence, control the EISs. 

These EISs are therefore consolidated by the Company as structured entities.

The related share-based compensation expenses incurred for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 were 

insignificant to the Group.

(d)  Share options and share award schemes adopted by subsidiaries

Certain subsidiaries of the Group operate their own share-based compensation plans (share option and/or share 

award schemes). Their exercise prices of the share options, as well as the vesting periods of the share options and 

awarded shares are determined by the board of directors of these subsidiaries at their sole discretion. Similar to the 

share option/award schemes adopted by the Company, the share options or restricted shares of the subsidiaries 

granted are normally vested by several tranches. Participants of some subsidiaries have the right to request the 

Group to repurchase their vested equity interests of the respective subsidiaries (“Repurchase Transaction”). The 

Group has discretion to settle the Repurchase Transaction by using either equity instruments of the Company or 

by cash. For the Repurchase Transaction which the Group has settlement options, the directors of the Company 

are currently of the view that they would be settled by equity instruments of the Company. As a result, they are 

accounted for using the equity-settled share-based payment method.

(e)  Expected retention rate of grantees

The Group has to estimate the expected yearly percentage of grantees that will stay within the Group at the end 

of  vesting  periods  of  the  options  and  awarded  shares  (the  “Expected  Retention  Rate”)  in  order  to  determine 

the  amount  of  share-based  compensation  expenses  charged  to  the  consolidated  income  statement.  As  at  31 

December 2017, the Expected Retention Rate of the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries was assessed to be 88%-

97% (2016: 88%-96%).

45  SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTROLLED STRUCTURED ENTITIES (Cont’d)

Note:

(a) 

As described in Note 1, the Company does not have legal ownership in equity of these structured entities or their subsidiaries. 

Nevertheless,  under  certain  contractual  agreements  entered  into  with  the  registered  owners  of  these  structured  entities,  the 

Company and its other legally owned subsidiaries control these companies by way of controlling the voting rights, governing their 

financial and operating policies, appointing or removing the majority of the members of their controlling authorities, and casting 

the majority of votes at meetings of such authorities. In addition, such contractual agreements also transfer the risks and rewards 

of these companies to the Company and/or its other legally owned subsidiaries. As a result, they are presented as controlled 

structured entities of the Company.

(b) 

The directors of the Company considered that the non-wholly owned subsidiaries with non-controlling interests are not significant 

to the Group, therefore, no summarised financial information of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is presented separately.

(c) 

All  subsidiaries’  undertakings  are  included  in  the  consolidation.  The  proportion  of  the  voting  rights  in  the  subsidiary’s 

undertakings held directly by the parent company do not differ from its proportion of ordinary shares held. The parent company 

further does not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary’s undertakings included in the Group.

(d) 

Significant restrictions

As at 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash of the Group, amounting to RMB98,144 

million were held in Mainland China and they are subject to local exchange control and other financial and treasury regulations. 

The local exchange control, and other financial and treasury regulations provide for restrictions, on payment of dividends, share 

repurchase and offshore investments, other than through normal activities.

(e) 

Consolidation of structured entities

As mentioned in Note (a) above and Note 33(c), the Company has consolidated the operating entities within the Group without 

any  legal  interests  and  the  EISs  out  of  which  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  act  as  general  partner.  In  addition, 

due to the implementation of the share award schemes of the Group mentioned in Note 33(b), the Company has also set up a 

structured entity (“Share Scheme Trust”), and its particulars are as follows:

Structured entity

Principal activities

Share Scheme Trust

Administering and holding the Company’s shares acquired for share award 

  schemes which are set up for the benefits of eligible persons of the Schemes

As the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Share Scheme Trust and can derive benefits 

from the contributions of the eligible persons who are awarded with the shares by the schemes, the directors of the Company 

consider that it is appropriate to consolidate the Share Scheme Trust.

During  the  year  ended  31  December  2017,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  RMB2,232  million  (2016:  RMB1,936 

million) to the Share Scheme Trust for financing its acquisition of the Company’s shares.
